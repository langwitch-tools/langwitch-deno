To do that, you need to know who that person is.	Ukuze wenze lokho, kufanele wazi ukuthi ubani lowo.
Or maybe not everyone knows that.	Noma mhlawumbe wonke umuntu akakwazi lokho.
And it all happened so fast.	Futhi konke kwenzeka ngokushesha okukhulu.
Everyone knows everything.	Wonke umuntu wazi konke.
That's just me.	Yimi nje lowo.
Everyone wants to do better.	Wonke umuntu ufuna ukwenza kangcono.
But something happened to me.	Kodwa kukhona okwenzeka kimi.
Little did they know that he would return.	Bengazi ukuthi uzobuya.
I live in a small house.	Ngihlala endlini encane.
He knew everything he needed to know.	Wayazi konke okwakudingeka akwazi.
That would be a serious mistake.	Lokho kungaba iphutha elikhulu.
He didn't want to think about that.	Wayengafuni ukucabanga ngalokho.
It's hard.	Kunzima.
I would never ask for such a thing.	Angisoze ngacela into enjalo.
You too.	Nawe futhi.
He does everything hard.	Wenza konke kanzima.
No, that's not the case.	Cha, akulona icala.
He says no.	Uthi cha.
He knows he can.	Uyazi angakwazi.
That would not be good.	Ngeke kube kuhle lokho.
Everyone wants power.	Wonke umuntu ufuna amandla.
Still it should.	Noma kunjalo kufanele.
I can no longer wait.	Angisakwazi ukulinda.
What is your opinion?	Uthini umbono wakho?
I think you can't do that.	Ngicabanga ukuthi ngeke ukwenze lokho.
He left at night.	Wahamba ebusuku.
He saw the danger.	Wabona ingozi.
That doesn't mean anything now.	Lokho akusho lutho manje.
You look bad.	Ubukeka kabi.
Probably too much.	Mhlawumbe kakhulu.
Still.	Noma kunjalo.
I know nothing.	Angazi lutho.
That is really true.	Lokho kuyiqiniso ngempela.
I need to get out of here.	Ngidinga ukuphuma lapha.
I doubt that will happen.	Ngiyangabaza ukuthi lokho kuzokwenzeka.
Make me your dinner.	Ngenze isidlo sakho sakusihlwa.
And it really is.	Futhi kunjalo ngempela.
I did not want to get married.	Ngangingafuni ukushada.
Someone who does work.	Umuntu owenza umsebenzi.
Think for a moment before he speaks.	Acabange isikhashana ngaphambi kokuthi akhulume.
I heard myself.	Ngizwe mina.
I go to school.	Ngiya esikoleni.
You do not know why.	Awazi ukuthi kungani ngempela.
But first.	Kodwa kuqala.
You really should have known that.	Bekufanele ngempela ukwazi lokho.
I just can't.	Ngeke nje ngikwazi.
Too many people.	Abantu abaningi kakhulu.
He told me that himself.	Wangitshela lokho yena.
And it should be.	Futhi kufanele kube.
We can't do that.	Asikwazi ukwenza kanjalo.
It's not a party.	Akuyona iphathi.
You need help with this.	Udinga usizo ngalokhu.
I've only been here.	Kade ngilapha kuphela.
I had to sit there waiting.	Kwadingeka ngihlale lapho ngilinde.
He is here now.	Ulapha manje.
I can't tell you right now.	Angikwazi ukukutshela njengamanje.
All his life.	Impilo yakhe yonke.
No, there is not.	Cha, akukho.
We have to do this every morning !.	Kufanele sikwenze lokhu njalo ekuseni!.
I had no idea what to do!	Ngangingazi ukuthi ngenzeni!
But it happened.	Kodwa kwenzeka.
You just want to talk.	Ufuna ukukhuluma nje.
An error occurred.	Kwenzeke iphutha.
Please buy his book.	Ngicela uthenge incwadi yakhe.
But he did not say anything.	Kodwa akazange akhulume lutho.
You need to know everything.	Udinga ukwazi konke.
He didn't have to think too long.	Akazange kudingeke acabange isikhathi eside kakhulu.
I need to know how he did it.	Ngidinga ukwazi ukuthi wakwenza kanjani.
He knew he had to do something.	Wayazi ukuthi kufanele enze okuthile.
My friend never told me her name.	Umngane wami akazange angitshele igama lakhe.
He decided to say that.	Wanquma ukusho lokho.
Something else is happening.	Kukhona futhi okwenzekayo.
But not just work.	Kodwa hhayi nje umsebenzi.
It had to be that way.	Kwakufanele kube njalo.
Traveling here is great.	Ukuhamba lapha kuhle.
Bad idea, I hope you eventually won't.	Umbono omubi, ngethemba ukuthi ekugcineni ngeke.
Being able to cook very well.	Ukwazi ukupheka kahle kakhulu.
And he just won't eat.	Futhi ngeke nje adle.
I mean, hard.	Ngisho, kanzima.
Even me.	Ngisho mina.
However, this is not really the case.	Noma kunjalo, lokhu akunjalo ngempela.
Nothing to him yet.	Akukho lutho kuye okwamanje.
He looks wrong to me.	Ubukeka engalungile kimi.
It should be me thank you.	Kufanele kube yimina ngiyabonga.
The question is whether this is so.	Umbuzo uthi ngabe kunjalo ngempela yini.
He wanted her, and only her.	Wayefuna yena, futhi yena kuphela.
I do not understand how.	Angiqondi ukuthi kanjani.
This is sometimes difficult to do.	Lokhu ngezinye izikhathi kunzima ukukwenza.
Something.	Okuthile.
I am no one but myself.	Angiyena omunye umuntu, ngaphandle kwami.
You will have a bad time.	Uzoba nesikhathi esibi.
This is my place.	Lena indawo yami.
Want something?	Ufuna okuthile?
Just as he did.	Njengoba enza nje.
Good job on this !.	Muhle umsebenzi kulokhu!.
And whoever it is, he says.	Futhi kungaba ubani lowo, usho.
I did not know.	Bengingazi.
In all, you have arrived safely.	Kukho konke, ufike kahle.
You should not have been out.	Bekungafanele ube ngaphandle.
Thank you, thank you.	Ngiyabonga, ngiyabonga.
Something here is not entirely true.	Okuthile lapha akulona iqiniso ngokuphelele.
He could not stop thinking about her.	Akakwazanga ukuyeka ukucabanga ngaye.
In a good way.	Ngendlela enhle.
He really is.	Nguye ngempela.
I was thinking about it.	Bengicabanga ngakho.
He needs to hear from you.	Udinga ukuzwa kuwe.
Only in the room.	Kuphela ekamelweni.
Certainly not.	Impela ubengeke.
Another good thing to do.	Enye into enhle ukuyenza.
You do not want music.	Awufuni umculo.
Nobody wants to stay here.	Akekho ofuna ukuhlala lapha.
I have never seen my children now.	Angikaze ngibone izingane zami manje.
We need a new approach.	Sidinga indlela entsha.
I feel more.	Ngizwa okwengeziwe.
There is nothing wrong with me.	Akukho okubi ngami.
It could be his son.	Kungaba indodana yakhe.
But that should not be the case.	Kodwa lokho akufanele kube njalo.
We have to go!	Kuzomele sihambe!
He can be of help.	Angaba usizo.
That's another thing.	Yilokho enye into.
I'm glad to hear this.	Ngiyajabula ukuzwa lokhu.
Now you have to eat.	Manje kufanele udle.
We did not do that.	Asizange senze kanjalo.
It really does look that way.	Impela kubukeka kanjalo.
And it should not.	Futhi akufanele.
Because it is not true.	Ngoba akulona iqiniso.
He had to stop thinking about that.	Kwadingeka ayeke ukucabanga lokho.
He traveled all over the world.	Wahamba emhlabeni wonke.
Maybe he did.	Mhlawumbe wakwenza.
Maybe you went too fast.	Mhlawumbe uhambe ngokushesha kakhulu.
I don't really know what to do.	Angazi ngempela ukuthi ngenzeni.
He did not even go home.	Akazange aye ngisho ekhaya.
To me, that.	Kimi, lokho.
Very nice picture.	Isithombe esihle kakhulu.
At once he felt behind her.	Ngaso leso sikhathi wezwa ngemuva kwakhe.
This is a minor problem.	Lena inkinga encane.
He lives in the city.	Uhlala edolobheni.
Thank you so much !!.	Ngiyabonga kakhulu!!.
He is too tall.	Mude kakhulu.
He did a few things, but not much.	Wenza izinto ezimbalwa, kodwa hhayi okuningi.
He wanted to do it.	Wayefuna ukukwenza.
He knew, not me.	Wayazi, hhayi mina.
I feel bad.	Ngizizwa kabi.
But he had to make a decision.	Kodwa kwakufanele enze isinqumo.
Or almost everyone.	Noma cishe wonke umuntu.
Maybe so and maybe not.	Mhlawumbe kunjalo futhi mhlawumbe akunjalo.
He told me about him.	Wangitshela ngaye.
Either one or not.	Kungenzeka eyodwa noma cha.
Is that possible ?.	Kungenzeka yini lokho?.
Now it will be difficult.	Manje kuzoba nzima.
I had to help my father.	Kwadingeka ngisize ubaba.
But every great man has done that.	Kodwa wonke umuntu omkhulu ukwenzile lokho.
You say you need to know.	Usho ukuthi udinga ukwazi.
However, sometimes.	Noma kunjalo, ngezinye izikhathi.
I also do not like to think too much.	Nami angithandi ukucabanga kakhulu.
Why it should.	Kungani kufanele.
Our mood is good.	Umoya wethu muhle.
There is more.	Kukhona okunye.
Yes, that would be much better.	Yebo, lokho kuzoba ngcono kakhulu.

And that one is probably wrong again.	Futhi lowo cishe cishe unephutha futhi.

Probably not.	Mhlawumbe akazange.
This is however difficult.	Lokhu kodwa kunzima.
I thought it was possible.	Ngacabanga ukuthi kungenzeka.
He thought it was good but was a little surprised.	Wayecabanga ukuthi kuhle kodwa wamangala kancane.
What a child, what a beautiful child.	Yeka ingane, yeka ingane enhle.
I'm not sure about that.	Angiqiniseki kulokho.
All of this is very good.	Konke lokhu kuhle kakhulu.

And there is more to it.	Futhi kukhona okwengeziwe kukho.
I'm glad to be here.	Ngiyajabula ukuba lapha.
But not his eyes.	Kodwa hhayi amehlo akhe.
That's his problem, that's not my problem.	Inkinga yakhe leyo, akuyona inkinga yami leyo.

He is not here.	Akekho lapha.
I knew it was true.	Ngangazi ukuthi kuyiqiniso.

When he got home.	Lapho efika ekhaya.
That's the vision.	Lowo umbono.

Same thing again.	Into efanayo futhi.
And he loves it all too.	Futhi uthanda futhi konke.
He could not get out.	Akakwazanga ukuphuma.
A pretty good gun.	Isibhamu esihle esihle.
This is very well done.	Lokhu kwenziwe kahle kakhulu.
I'm not sure what the problem is.	Angiqiniseki ukuthi yini inkinga.
A choice had to be made.	Kwakufanele kwenziwe ukukhetha.
Lots of meat.	Inyama eningi.
I don't even know how that can happen.	Angazi nokuthi kungenzeka kanjani lokho.
Not now, though.	Hhayi manje, noma kunjalo.
Let me talk about this.	Ake ngikhulume kabi ngalokhu.
He arrived late for the meeting.	Wafika sekwephuzile emhlanganweni.

Or maybe not.	Noma mhlawumbe akunjalo.
That time now.	Leso sikhathi manje.
That could be another book.	Lokho kungaba enye incwadi.

He is a human being.	Ungumuntu.
He thought no one knew.	Wayecabanga ukuthi akekho owaziyo.
I feel so happy.	Ngizizwa ngijabule kakhulu.
He did nothing.	Akazange enze lutho.
Not him.	Hhayi yena.
That's another job.	Omunye umsebenzi lowo.

So no one is here.	Ngakho akekho akekho lapha.
He does not want to know the name.	Akafuni ukwazi igama.

That will take months.	Lokho kuzothatha izinyanga.
I am sure you will do well.	Ngiqinisekile ukuthi uzokwenza kahle.
He took the water.	Wathatha amanzi.

Definitely a dog.	Nakanjani inja.
This is good.	Kuhle lokhu.
He could not stop thinking about it.	Akakwazanga ukuyeka ukucabanga ngakho.
And there may be some truth to that.	Futhi kungase kube khona iqiniso kulokho.
Lots of books.	Izincwadi eziningi.
No one is there.	Akukho muntu lapho.
I'm not sure there is anything else.	Angiqiniseki ukuthi kukhona okunye.
To do that once again.	Ukwenza lokho kanye futhi.

Sometimes I think so.	Ngezinye izikhathi ngicabanga kanjalo.
No problem there.	Ayikho inkinga lapho.
Unless it is.	Ngaphandle kokuthi akunjalo.
I'm afraid to talk to her.	Ngesaba ukukhuluma naye.
Why did this happen?	Kungani lokhu kwenzeka?
But he was not on time.	Kodwa wayengekho ngesikhathi.
This must have happened to you a lot.	Lokhu kumele ukuthi kwenzeke kuwe kakhulu.

Or his parents.	Noma abazali bakhe.

He wants a family.	Ufuna umndeni.
I have to know who did this.	Kufanele ngazi ukuthi ubani owenze lokhu.
This is not your child.	Akuyona ingane yakho lena.
That's it.	Yilokho.
I said yes.	Ngathi kunjalo.
I wanted him back, of course.	Bengifuna abuye, kunjalo.
You probably will.	Cishe uzoba.
Maybe that's not the best way to do it.	Mhlawumbe leyo akuyona indlela engcono kakhulu yokwenza.

Looks like he doesn't know much about the problem.	Kubukeka sengathi akazi okuningi ngale nkinga.
There is no one out here.	Akukho muntu lapha ngaphandle.
You would not do such a thing.	Ubungeke wenze into enjalo.
That is not the case here.	Lokho akunjalo lapha.
You look really bad, you know.	Ubukeka kabi ngempela, uyazi.
You know it's true.	Uyazi ukuthi kuyiqiniso.
Permission only.	Imvume kuphela.

That is not true.	Lokho akulona iqiniso.
And you too will be here.	Futhi nawe uzobe ulapha.
However, it is not really my money.	Noma kunjalo, akuyona imali yami ngempela.
He didn't want me to tell you.	Wayengafuni ngikutshele.

Learning to live with me will be difficult.	Ukufunda ukuhlala nami kuzoba nzima.
A decision had to be made.	Kwadingeka kwenziwe isinqumo.
Entering the park is not required.	Ukungena epaki akudingekile.
Not at all good about his work.	Akunjalo neze kahle ngomsebenzi wakhe.
I did very well most days.	Ngenza kahle kakhulu izinsuku eziningi.
With him, he started small.	Naye, waqala kancane.

It will not.	Ngeke.
There is so much more than that.	Kuningi kakhulu kunalokho.
He did not see how it could be him.	Akazange abone ukuthi kungenzeka kanjani ukuba nguye.
He made a vision.	Wenza umbono.
To tell you.	Ukukutshela.
I would never say such a thing.	Angisoze ngisho into enjalo.

Only pain.	Ubuhlungu kuphela.
So it is very true.	Ngakho kuyiqiniso kakhulu.

He arrived too late for the meeting.	Ufike sekwephuzile kakhulu emhlanganweni.
You made such a beautiful picture.	Wenze isithombe esihle kangaka.
I just said.	Ngisho nje.
Also, the task is often difficult.	Futhi, umsebenzi uvame ukuba nzima.
Nothing.	Hhayi lutho.
If you want to do that, fine.	Uma ufuna ukwenza lokho, kulungile.
I want to at least try.	Ngifuna okungenani ukuzama.
And so he went to make his way on earth.	Futhi ngakho wahamba ukuze enze indlela yakhe emhlabeni.
I know everything about him.	Ngazi konke ngaye.
You're just wrong.	Unephutha nje.

He said so, too.	Wakhuluma kanjalo, futhi.
You mean.	Usho ukuthi.
But he could not go to her.	Kodwa akakwazanga ukuya kuye.
Stop smoking.	Yeka ukubhema.
You want to talk to me, you don't show up here.	Ufuna ukukhuluma nami, awubonakali lapha.
I don't want his money.	Angifuni imali yakhe.
About time, too.	Cishe isikhathi, futhi.
That is not his way.	Akuyona indlela yakhe leyo.

Reading your book has been very helpful to me.	Ukufunda incwadi yakho kube usizo kakhulu kimi.

He tries to do this whenever possible.	Uzama ukwenza lokhu noma nini lapho kungenzeka.
But again, that will take time.	Kodwa futhi, lokho kuzothatha isikhathi.
And no one does anything about it.	Futhi akekho owenza lutho ngakho.
That is what really happened.	Yilokho okwenzeka ngempela.
But everyone decided to go ahead.	Kodwa wonke umuntu wanquma ukuqhubeka.
Still, he could not.	Noma kunjalo, akakwazanga.

My question here is still.	Umbuzo wami lapha namanje uthi.
So he did not.	Ngakho akazange.

But that is not all.	Kodwa akukhona lokho kuphela.

What do you look like?	Ubukeka kanjani?
Everything sounds good in my world.	Konke kuzwakala kulungile emhlabeni wami.

But he should have known better.	Kodwa bekufanele azi kangcono.
Deep dive drowning.	Wazama wazama wazama.
It has to be.	Kufanele kube.
He would never say such a thing.	Akasoze asho into enjalo.

He took his time.	Wathatha isikhathi sakhe.
There is nothing there.	Akukho lutho lapho.

And still it is not.	Futhi namanje akunjalo.
A new place every day.	Indawo entsha nsuku zonke.
But that is not true.	Kodwa akulona iqiniso.
Finally he came to her.	Ekugcineni weza kuye.
She has no answer.	Akanayo impendulo.
Obviously, this is not true.	Ngokusobala, lokhu akulona iqiniso.
I will be, too.	Ngizoba, nami.
Anyone can do the job.	Noma ubani angakwazi ukwenza umsebenzi.
We did well.	Senze kahle.

There is no danger here.	Impilo ayikho ingozi lapha.
But that is not a problem.	Kodwa lokho akuyona inkinga.

Or came to him.	Noma weza kuye.
Tell me, tell me.	Ngitshele, ngitshele.
She's good enough, and she'll definitely be good enough.	Muhle ngokwanele, futhi nakanjani uzoba muhle ngokwanele.
And another.	Futhi omunye.
Someone will go.	Umuntu uzohamba.
I made a choice.	Ngenza ukukhetha.
He said thank you.	Wathi ngiyabonga.
I want to get better tomorrow.	Ngifuna ukuba ngcono kusasa.
At least, close.	Okungenani, eduze.
He could not do this.	Wayengeke akwazi ukwenza lokhu.
He was not thinking of food.	Wayengacabangi ukudla.
He certainly would not have done that.	Impela ubengeke akwenze lokho.
As you probably know.	Njengoba kungenzeka uyazi.
Food is here.	Ukudla kukhona lapha.
Very strong.	Amandla kakhulu.
But, man has to be what he really is.	Kodwa, umuntu kufanele abe yilokho ayikho ngempela.
One at the beginning and one in the middle.	Omunye ekuqaleni omunye phakathi.
And really, isn’t it?	Futhi ngempela, akunjalo?
Not me.	Hhayi nami.
Yes you should.	Yebo kufanele.
I think he wanted to.	Ngicabanga ukuthi wayefuna.
And, of course,.	Futhi, kunjalo,.
I thought about it for the first time.	Ngacabanga ngakho okokuqala.
Thinking before you act.	Ukucabanga ngaphambi kokuthi enze.
I don't know how I can do that.	Angazi ukuthi ngingakwenza kanjani lokho.
A book, perhaps.	Incwadi, mhlawumbe.
Now let me speak.	Manje ake ngikhulume.
Three hours late.	Amahora amathathu sekwephuzile.
I mean, good enough.	Ngisho, kuhle ngokwanele.
I want to talk to him.	Ngifuna ukukhuluma naye.

He knew something, but he was not sure what it was.	Wayazi okuthile, kodwa wayengenaso isiqiniseko sokuthi yini ngempela.
He had to go.	Bekufanele ahambe.
So will you.	Nawe kuzoba njalo.
No one knows what happened there.	Akekho owaziyo ukuthi kwenzekani lapho.
I do not want to say anything.	angifuni ukusho lutho.
But this is the first time.	Kodwa lokhu okokuqala.
I want to hear from him.	Ngifuna ukuzwa kuye.
He wanted to be there very badly.	Wayefuna ukuba lapho kabi kakhulu.
I did the work.	Ngenze umsebenzi.
I need to know that you can do that.	Ngidinga ukwazi ukuthi ungakwenza lokho.
But there is more.	Kodwa kukhona okunye.
Maybe you should stay home today.	Mhlawumbe kufanele uhlale ekhaya namuhla.
Maybe you want to talk.	Mhlawumbe ufuna ukukhuluma.
Hopefully you can not say.	Ngethemba awukwazi ukusho.
So far, so good.	Kuze kube manje, kuhle kakhulu.
In his own way.	Ngendlela yakhe.
He did not want to say.	Wayengafuni ukusho.
It is difficult to say this in advance.	Kunzima ukusho lokhu kusenesikhathi.
I wanted to hear something.	Ngangifuna ukuzwa okuthile.
That is not my name.	Akulona igama lami lelo.
He went with it.	Wahamba ngayo.
Just playing with you.	Ukudlala ngawe nje.
Great mistake.	Iphutha elikhulu.
I would love to hear more.	Ngingathanda ukuzwa okwengeziwe.
I just can't do it.	Ngeke nje ngikwenze.
Or at least very few.	Noma okungenani ambalwa kakhulu.
For me out.	Kimi nje.
Her father died when she was very young.	Ubaba wakhe washona esemncane.
He must have it.	Kumele abe nakho.
Not a real idea.	Akuwona umbono impela.
It looks like that though.	Kubukeka kunjalo kodwa.
He just didn't know where it was.	Wayengazi nje ukuthi kuphi.
But there is no time now.	Kodwa asikho isikhathi manje.
Sometimes at least.	Ngezinye izikhathi okungenani.
And the vision lasts a lifetime.	Futhi umbono uhlala kuye impilo yonke.
He too wanted to get out.	Naye wayefuna ukuphuma.
He tried another approach.	Wazama enye indlela.
Thank you.	Mina ngiyabonga.
Not a bad thing.	Hhayi into embi.
I wanted to talk to you.	Bengifuna ukukhuluma nawe.
Your dad often goes to work.	Ubaba wakho uvame ukuhamba ngomsebenzi.
But he did not know why he was leaving.	Kodwa wayengazi ukuthi uhambe ngani.
But it is possible.	Kodwa kungenzeka.
Probably not.	Kungenzeka ukuthi ngeke.
Do it.	Wenzeni.
I was saying you to me.	Bengithi wena kimi.
But only for you.	Kodwa ngawe kuphela.
That's his name.	Igama lakhe lelo.
When anything can happen.	Lapho kungenzeka noma yini.

And he arrived in the morning.	Futhi wafika ekuseni.
Yes, of course.	Yebo, nakanjani.
That's right, that's right.	Kunjalo nje, kunjalo.
And time.	Futhi isikhathi.
He would not be helpful.	Wayengeke abe usizo.
But it probably shouldn't.	Kodwa cishe akufanele.
And also.	Futhi okunye.
To do that, he had to eat.	Ukuze enze lokho, kwakudingeka adle.
And there it is.	Futhi kukhona.
There will be another.	Kuzoba khona omunye.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbe akekho.
Well done.	Wenze kahle.
There is nothing to do now.	Akukho okumele ukwenze manje.

Also, play.	Futhi, ukudlala.
You expect too much from me.	Ulindele okukhulu kakhulu kimi.
But that's not really much.	Kodwa lokho akuyona into eningi ngempela.
Eventually, it happened.	Ekugcineni, kwenzeka.
Tonight.	Namuhla ebusuku.
I couldn’t do much with him.	Angikwazanga ukwenza okuningi naye.
It will be easy.	Uzoba lula.
But he knew too much.	Kodwa wayazi kakhulu.
He went alone.	Wahamba yedwa.
Call a doctor.	Ashayele udokotela.
He found his time in the morning.	Uthole isikhathi sakhe ekuseni.
He did not try to get to know anyone.	Akazange azame ukwazi muntu.
But that will not happen.	Kodwa lokho ngeke kwenzeke.

Except for maybe one thing, he says.	Ngaphandle kokuthi mhlawumbe into eyodwa, uthi.
Everyone does their job.	Wonke umuntu wenza umsebenzi wakhe.
Or, rather, to me.	Noma, kunalokho, kimi.
And stop crying.	Futhi yeka ukukhala.
Absolutely not.	Nakanjani akekho.

Are you willing to try again?	Uzimisele ukuzama futhi?
In this case it is not.	Kulokhu akunjalo.
He is a better man.	Uyindoda engcono.
Are you sure you would like to do that?	Uqinisekile ukuthi ungathanda ukwenza lokho?
But in all, no.	Kodwa kukho konke, cha.
I never told anyone.	Angikaze ngitshele muntu.
I'm glad you'll be with me there.	Ngiyajabula ukuthi uzoba nami lapho.
I know it will not be easy to know.	Ngiyazi angeke kube lula ukwazi.

I need to know everything.	Ngidinga ukwazi konke.
This looks very good.	Lokhu kubonakala kuhle kakhulu.
Someone with him.	Omunye naye.
But for now, it will be you.	Kodwa okwamanje, kuzoba nguwe.
This is the right approach.	Lena indlela efanele.
We should have done that.	Bekufanele sikwenze lokho.
That is probably true.	Lokho cishe kuyiqiniso.

Not much, of course.	Hhayi okuningi, kunjalo.
It would probably be okay.	Cishe kungaba kulungile.
I am very happy thank you.	Ngijabule kakhulu ngiyabonga.
So we did.	Ngakho senza.

This is a big money.	Imali enkulu lena.
But you have to go.	Kodwa kufanele uhambe.
I want to do a lot of things.	Ngifuna ukwenza izinto eziningi.
So that's fine.	Ngakho kuhle lokho.

No matter how badly he wanted it.	Noma ngabe wayefuna kabi kangakanani.
He arrived at night.	Wafika ebusuku.
I can't remember which one.	Angisakhumbuli ukuthi iyiphi.

I want to tell you about it.	Ngifuna ukutshela ngakho.
And that would mean something.	Futhi lokho kungaba ukusho okuthile.
And, apparently, he is not.	Futhi, ngokusobala, akayena.
Now, not a problem.	Manje, hhayi inkinga.
I don't think that will happen for a while.	Angicabangi ukuthi lokho kuzokwenzeka isikhashana.

This is very true.	Lokhu kuyiqiniso kakhulu.
But that was not done.	Kodwa lokho akuzange kwenziwe.
Should it be good?	Kufanele kube kuhle?

Good choice.	Kuhle ukukhetha.
There is no finding today that it is so.	Akukho ukuthola namuhla ukuthi kunjalo.
But in the way he says it.	Kodwa ngendlela akusho ngayo.
You should get a message from him.	Kufanele uthole umlayezo kuye.
I do so.	Ngenza njalo.
If you like, please eat.	Uma uthanda, ngicela udle.
Great too.	Enkulu futhi.
Not a good idea.	Akuwona umqondo omuhle.

So far everything seems fine.	Kuze kube manje konke kubonakala kulungile.
I didn't really want to know.	Ngangingafuni ngempela ukwazi.

There is no answer.	Ayikho impendulo.

He did not think that he lived alone.	Wayengacabangi ukuthi uhlala endaweni yedwa.
I want to know too.	Nami ngifuna ukwazi.
It is quite obvious.	Impela kusobala.
Of course it is not just about that.	Yebo akukhona nje ngalokho.
That is why.	Yingakho nje.

I think the worst.	Ngicabanga okubi kakhulu.
You feel things.	Uzizwa izinto.
I have a lot to do today.	Kuningi okumele ngikwenze namuhla.
That's right, and it's not.	Kunjalo, futhi akunjalo.

He will be coming soon.	Uzofika maduze nje.
Not too low, not too high.	Hhayi phansi kakhulu, hhayi phezulu kakhulu.
It will take months, even years.	Kuzothatha izinyanga, iminyaka ngisho.
You have been so good to me.	Ube muhle kimi.
I have to get there.	Kumele ngifike lapho.
Hardly it is not a team then.	Kunzima akulona iqembu uma kunjalo.
And it did.	Futhi kwenzeka.
I do not know how it happened.	Angazi ukuthi kwenzeke kanjani.
And that will not happen.	Futhi lokho ngeke kwenzeke.
I have always wanted to go.	Bengilokhu ngifuna ukuhamba.
As it has always been.	Njengoba kade enjalo.
You did a good job there.	Wenze umsebenzi omuhle lapho.
But she is beautiful.	Kodwa muhle.
That's all.	Yilokho kuphela.
Talented.	Onekhono.
I hope you are happy !!.	Ngethemba ukuthi ujabule!!.
I hope not too.	Ngethemba ukuthi ngeke nami.
But if you have to go, you have to.	Kodwa uma kufanele uhambe, kufanele.
He once was.	Wake waba nguye.
No one else, and you just arrived this morning.	Akekho omunye, futhi ufike ekuseni nje.
He is also.	Uyena futhi.
In the end it did not happen.	Ekugcineni akuzange kwenzeke.
Let me think.	Ake ngicabange.
It will take too long.	Kuzothatha isikhathi eside kakhulu.
One of us, now.	Omunye wethu, manje.
Right there.	Khona lapho.
He just looked.	Wabuka nje.
I want to play, but no one else around	Ngifuna ukudlala, kodwa akekho omunye eduze
You are sure to win.	Uqinisekile ukuthi uzowina.
I wish it was me.	Ngifisa sengathi ngabe yimi.
That is very true.	Lokho kuyiqiniso kakhulu.
Yes he did.	Yebo wakwenza.
This is the answer.	Lena impendulo.
But nothing more.	Kodwa akukho okunye.
Not out yet !.	Hhayi ngaphandle okwamanje!.
There is nothing here for him.	Akukho lutho lapha kuye.
But there is more, much more.	Kodwa kukhona okwengeziwe, okuningi kakhulu.
I don't have to know that.	Akumele ngikwazi lokho.
It will not be easy.	Ngeke kube lula.
He died doing his job.	Washona enza umsebenzi wakhe.
I mean it has to be that way.	Ngisho ukuthi kufanele kube njalo.
I don't have to.	Akumele ngenze.
I don't know why exactly.	Angazi ukuthi kungani ngempela.
I made this happen.	Ngenze lokhu kwenzeke.
We all did not.	Nathi sonke asizange.
We need to come here often.	Sidinga ukuza lapha kaningi.
Just because you know something doesn't mean everyone knows it.	Ukuthi wazi okuthile akusho ukuthi wonke umuntu uyazi.
You wouldn't do that.	Ubungeke ukwenze lokho.
It has to be done right.	Kufanele kwenziwe kahle.
And not only this.	Futhi hhayi lokhu kuphela.
I couldn’t get out of there quickly enough.	Angikwazanga ukuphuma lapho ngokushesha ngokwanele.
And you want to know why.	Futhi ufuna ukwazi ukuthi kungani.
I tried to control myself.	Ngazama ukuzibamba.
We haven’t done much since then.	Asizange senze okuningi kusukela ngaleso sikhathi.
I mean, a little bit, all right.	Ngisho, kancane, kulungile.
It just shouldn't.	Akufanele nje.
No, that is not true.	Cha, akulona iqiniso lelo.
His singing on this is that.	Ukucula kwakhe kulokhu ukuthi.
Whatever.	Noma ngabe yini.
He came to the door.	Wafika emnyango.
He does things.	Wenza izinto.
I have no money now.	Anginayo imali manje.
I know nothing about it.	Angazi lutho ngakho.
He works hard.	Usebenza kanzima.
What about you?	Wena yini?.
I did not know which one.	Ngangingazi ukuthi iyiphi.
It will not be difficult.	Ngeke kube nzima.
Not really.	Empeleni akunjalo.
Otherwise he would not have told me about it.	Okunye ubengeke angitshele ngaye.
I knew nothing about this.	Ngangingazi lutho ngalokhu.
And it is true.	Futhi kuyiqiniso.
Any danger.	Noma iyiphi ingozi.
He took up a large space.	Wathatha indawo enkulu.
You want to play like that.	Ufuna ukudlala kanjalo.
I'm sorry, he said.	Ngiyaxolisa, usho.
It would be hard to say.	Kungaba nzima ukusho.
Having sex with him.	Ukulala naye.
I don't know which one.	Angazi ukuthi iyiphi.
I'm happy for you.	Ngiyajabula ngawe.
All the time.	Sonke isikhathi.
It is very true.	Kuyiqiniso impela.
I've never been there before.	Angikaze ngibe lapho ngaphambili.
No, not at all.	Cha, hhayi futhi.
You will not do such a thing.	Ngeke wenze into enjalo.
He wanted to leave.	Wayefuna ahambe.
You are very much.	Nguwe kakhulu.
So he did what he had to do.	Ngakho wenza okwakudingeka akwenze.
You arrived on time.	Ufike ngesikhathi.
Sounds right.	Kuzwakala kulungile.
I saw right away.	Ngabona ngaso leso sikhathi.
You don't have to do it.	Akufanele ukwenze.
All right, so.	Kulungile, ngakho.
Actually.	Empeleni.
It's good to be together again, that's right.	Kuhle ukuba ndawonye futhi, kunjalo.
I didn't, no.	Angizange, cha.
One or the other.	Omunye noma omunye.
You are going there.	Uya khona.
Don't forget.	Ungakhohlwa.
Yes, everything.	Yebo, konke.
He thought he was saying something about it.	Wayecabanga ukuthi usho okuthile ngakho.
He was not even a family man.	Wayengeyena ngisho umndeni.
It is by no means a good idea.	Akuwona neze umqondo omuhle.
It has happened to all of us.	Kwenzeke kithi sonke.
You do not know how.	Awazi kanjani.
It's the only thing that goes on in the city.	Yinto kuphela ehamba edolobheni.
It should not be too difficult.	Akufanele kube nzima kakhulu.
It is time for him to speak.	Sekuyisikhathi sokuthi akhulume.
It could happen tomorrow.	Kungenzeka kusasa.
Let me tell you my way.	Ake ngikutshele indlela yami.
It was necessary.	Kwakudingeka.
She was scared.	Wayesaba.
I can't get in.	Angikwazi ukungena.
He could not say anything else.	Akakwazanga ukusho okunye.
Maybe so.	Mhlawumbe kunjalo.
You will do this right now.	Uzokwenza lokhu njengamanje.
Unless you are present.	Ngaphandle uma ukhona.
Or I should have.	Noma bekufanele ngenze.
He wanted to fix this.	Wayefuna ukulungisa lokhu.
I said, this is great.	Ngathi, lokhu kuhle kakhulu.
Right now I am very happy.	Njengamanje ngijabule kakhulu.
And soon he will be gone.	Futhi ngokushesha uzohamba.
He did not do so.	Akazange enze njalo.
You just can't get bad food.	Ngeke nje uthole ukudla okubi.
But you can't go with us.	Kodwa awukwazi ukuhamba nathi.
Not later.	Akukho kamuva.
In a big way.	Ngendlela enkulu.
I hope this has been helpful.	Ngethemba ukuthi lokhu kube usizo.
He wants what he can't have.	Ufuna lokho angeke abe nakho.
But in the end he did it.	Kodwa ekugcineni wakwenza.
And that's fine, too.	Futhi lokho kuhle, futhi.
This way, not that.	Ngale ndlela, hhayi ukuthi.
Everyone knows that.	Wonke umuntu uyakwazi lokho.
He does everything now.	Wenza konke manje.
Not true right now.	Akulona iqiniso njengamanje.
Thank you.	Ngiyabonga kuwe.
Once last night, and now again.	Kanye izolo ebusuku, futhi manje futhi.
He did not know what he was doing.	Wayengazi ukuthi wenzani.
A lot has happened since then.	Kuningi okwenzekile kusukela lapho.
I don't see any way in that.	Angiboni noma iyiphi indlela kulokho.
But we cannot just do this.	Kodwa lokhu ngeke sikwenze nje.
I don't want you to think that.	Angifuni ucabange lokho.
Good idea.	Umqondo omuhle.
Bad again.	Omubi futhi.
I knew he had ever done that.	Ngangazi ukuthi wake wakwenza lokho.
Not alone.	Hhayi ngedwa.
You do not want to do this.	Awufuni ukwenza lokhu.
Just like this here.	Kanje nje lapha.
Or maybe you.	Noma kungenzeka wena.
I told you though.	Ngikutshele kodwa.
In the end it will be so.	Ekugcineni kuzoba njalo.
No one deserves that.	Akekho okufanele lokho.
But there is nothing he can do.	Kodwa akukho angakwenza.
He can't stay long.	Akakwazi ukuhlala isikhathi eside.
I know it's hard, but that's what we have to do.	Ngiyazi ukuthi kunzima, kodwa yilokho okumele sikwenze.
Nothing happened to him.	Akukho okwenzekile kuye.
Not both of us.	Hhayi sobabili.
This is me!	Yimi lo!
I have to help.	Kumele ngisize.
Yes, it will.	Yebo, kuzokwenzeka.
Properly.	Ngendlela efanele.
I hope you get better soon.	Ngethemba ukuthi uzoba ngcono ngokushesha.
And there is someone else in the room.	Futhi kukhona omunye umuntu ekamelweni.
I mean, that's all right.	Ngisho, kulungile kuphela.
I just know it's good out here.	Ngiyazi nje ukuthi kuhle lapha ngaphandle.
Not when you are worried.	Hhayi lapho ukhathazekile.
This is no trivial matter.	Akuyona into encane lena.
He may say more.	Angase asho okwengeziwe.
Well money.	Kahle imali.
Just to have it.	Ukuze nje ube nakho.
There must be people.	Kufanele kube khona abantu.
It just shouldn't.	Bekungafanele nje.
I could not stop thinking about it.	Angikwazanga ukuyeka ukucabanga ngakho.
He got his job at a young age.	Wathola umsebenzi wakhe esemncane.
Did we go tonight?	Sihambe namhlanje ebusuku?
And that will not be easy.	Futhi lokho ngeke kube lula.
I know it will take a long time, yes.	Ngiyazi ukuthi kuzothatha isikhathi eside, yebo.
He just thought it was him.	Wavele wacabanga ukuthi nguye.
I have seen his picture.	Ngike ngabona isithombe sakhe.
Thanks in advance.	Ngiyabonga ngaphambilini.
So that's your advice.	Ngakho leso iseluleko sakho.
Talk about it.	Ukukhuluma ngakho.
That's all.	Konke lokho.
I never had my time.	Angikaze ngibe nesikhathi sami.
This is a beautiful dress.	Ingubo enhle lena.
But not food.	Kodwa hhayi ukudla.
A new concept for me.	Umqondo omusha kimi.
Still, it is not.	Noma kunjalo, akunjalo.
I'm sorry to say that, but it's true.	Ngiyaxolisa ukusho lokho, kodwa kuyiqiniso.
That is definitely not your way.	Akuyona neze indlela yakho leyo.
Returning to earth.	Ukubuyela emhlabeni.
It will not be good for you.	Ngeke kube kuhle kuwe.
But that's a good idea.	Kodwa umqondo omuhle lowo.
I did not want to leave.	Ngangingafuni ukuhamba.
But he did not want to.	Kodwa wayengafuni.
You have to go to school every day.	Kufanele uye esikoleni nsuku zonke.
It just won't happen.	Ngeke nje kwenzeke.
It just has to.	Kufanele nje.
But he did not know.	Kodwa wayengazi.
I'm amazed at you.	Ngiyamangala ngawe.
Too bad when he arrives.	Okubi kakhulu uma efika.
And that was never done.	Futhi lokho akuzange kwenziwe.
I'm really sorry.	Ngiyaxolisa ngempela.
Everything has to be his way.	Konke kufanele kube ngendlela yakhe.
That would be nice and easy.	Lokho kungaba kuhle futhi kube lula.
It means nothing to me.	Akusho lutho kimi.
And you can't do anything about this.	Futhi awukwazi ukwenza lutho ngalokhu.
Good idea.	Umbono omuhle.
I can't believe it.	Angikholwa neze.
I never went there.	Angizange ngiye lapho.
Not just for him.	Akukho nje kuye.
He has lived in a big city all his life.	Uhlale edolobheni elikhulu impilo yakhe yonke.
He did not think what had happened to him.	Wayengacabangi ukuthi kwenzekeni kuye.
I'm sorry, everyone, he thought.	Ngiyaxolisa, wonke umuntu, wacabanga.
Still, he agreed.	Noma kunalokho, wavuma.
The teacher walked out of the classroom.	Uthisha waphuma ekilasini.
I will not do that.	Ngeke ngenze kanjalo.
You do not need this to happen to you.	Awudingi ukuthi lokhu kwenzeke kuwe.
It's been great.	Kube kuhle.
Nice to be with you.	Ngiyajabula ukuba nawe.
It is very difficult to speak.	Kunzima kakhulu ukukhuluma.
That is not a new concept.	Akuwona umqondo omusha lowo.
That can be difficult right away.	Lokho kungaba nzima ngokushesha.
Traveling as hard and fast as possible.	Ukuhamba kanzima futhi ngokushesha ngangokunokwenzeka.
How is this possible?	Kungenzeka kanjani lokhu?
Or if you do.	Noma uma wenza.
I don't know about that, I'm sorry.	Angazi ngalokho, ngiyaxolisa.
That is your job.	Umsebenzi wakho lowo.
You know, how you feel about that.	Uyazi, uzizwa kanjani ngalokho.
It will not be obvious.	Ngeke kusobala.
You have made a lot of money too.	Wenze imali eningi futhi.
We did not do that.	Asizange sikwenze lokho.
Thank you thank you thank you !.	Ngiyabonga ngiyabonga ngiyabonga!.
You.	Wena.
It’s good to be beautiful.	Kuhle ukuba muhle.
But he was not thinking well at the time.	Kodwa wayengacabangi kahle ngaleso sikhathi.
Just a few weeks.	Amasonto ambalwa nje.
This is bad advice.	Lesi iseluleko esibi.
If you are really serious.	Uma uzimisele ngempela.
So much for me.	Kakhulu kangakanani kimi.
My mother is her mother.	Umama umama wakhe.
So, where you go.	Ngakho, lapho uya khona.
The problem is that you need to know how to do it.	Inkinga ukuthi udinga ukwazi ukuthi ukwenze kanjani.
He works on it.	Usebenza ngakho.
Tonight there is no danger.	Namuhla ebusuku ayikho ingozi.
I'm so happy to be here with you.	Ngijabule kakhulu ukuba lapha nawe.
He may even win.	Angase ngisho awine.
It never happened.	Akuzange kube njalo.
No, that is not the correct answer.	Cha, impendulo engalungile impela leyo.
It is also very difficult to do.	Kunzima kakhulu futhi ukwenza.
I just can't say.	Angikwazi nje ukusho.
She was afraid to be alone.	Wayesaba ukuba yedwa.
Very good person to work with.	Umuntu omuhle kakhulu ukusebenza naye.
Because that's not me.	Ngoba akumina lowo.
It is not life.	Akuyona impilo.
You know it's true.	Uyazi kuyiqiniso.
He started drinking a lot.	Waqala ukuphuza kakhulu.
I don't think he can make much money by doing that.	Angicabangi ukuthi angenza imali eningi ngokwenza lokho.
You may have done this.	Kungenzeka ukuthi ukwenzile lokhu.
No one should be here.	Akekho okufanele abe lapha.
He did not redo much.	Akazange enze kabusha okuningi.
But you must be determined.	Kodwa kumele uzimisele.
I want to know more.	Ngifuna ukwazi okuningi.
But it seems that someone has to think it can be.	Kodwa kubonakala sengathi othile kumelwe acabange ukuthi kungaba njalo.
I did not know what to do.	Ngangingazi ukuthi ngenzeni.
What happened to him?	Kwenzekani kuye?
How long.	Isikhathi eside kangakanani.
Or rather, until recently.	Noma kunalokho, kuze kube muva nje.
I had no idea he would stay all week.	Ngangingacabangi ukuthi uzohlala isonto lonke.
Just as it can be.	Kanye njengoba kungaba.
He went into his house.	Wangena endlini yakhe.
We know where you work.	Siyazi lapho usebenza khona.
Please stay where you are.	Ngicela uhlale lapho ukhona.
He may be the only one.	Kungenzeka kube nguye yedwa.
I did not get an answer.	Angizange ngithole impendulo.
It seems to exist.	Kubonakala sengathi kukhona.
And now here.	Futhi manje lapha.

It looks well done.	Kubukeka kwenziwe kahle.
Stop reading.	Ukuyeka ukufunda.

You want to do things.	Ufuna ukwenza izinto.
He knew what he was talking about.	Wayazi ukuthi ukhuluma ngani.

I need to get back to it.	Ngidinga ukubuyela kukho.
I was thinking now.	Bengicabanga manje.
He did not know what was happening.	Wayengazi ukuthi kwenzekani.
Life is all that.	Ukuphila konke lokho.
It can happen many times, only once, or never.	Kungenzeka izikhathi eziningi, kanye kuphela, noma neze.
He did that.	Ukwenzile lokho.
But you think it was wrong.	Kodwa ucabanga ukuthi kwakungafanele.
It should be done this way.	Kufanele kwenziwe kanje.
Our home is truly beautiful.	Umuzi wethu muhle ngempela.

First is not the best thing.	Okokuqala akuyona into engcono kakhulu.
Even people.	Ngisho abantu.

Okay for me.	Kulungile ngami.
No, not that one.	Cha, hhayi lowo.
His job requires him to travel a lot.	Umsebenzi wakhe udinga ukuthi ahambe kakhulu.

You will not stay.	Ngeke uhlale.

Please go this way.	Ngicela uhambe ngale ndlela.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Sekuyisikhathi sokuthi senze okuthile.
Then he realized why.	Khona lapho waqaphela ukuthi kungani.
But it was good.	Kodwa kube kuhle.
But she seemed happy.	Kodwa wayebonakala ejabule.
I did not feel any pain all the time.	Angizange ngizwe ubuhlungu sonke isikhathi.
But you stay in one place.	Kodwa uhlale endaweni eyodwa.
Someone has to say something.	Kufanele umuntu asho okuthile.
I have never found an error.	Angikaze ngithole iphutha.
Time now.	Isikhathi manje.
Lots of questions.	Imibuzo eminingi.
And now, it happens at home.	Futhi manje, kwenzeka ekhaya.
You will be a great mother.	Uzoba umama omkhulu.
I know this to be true.	Ngiyazi ukuthi lokhu kuyiqiniso.
Simply put, he said.	Kalula nje, wathi.
This is not a person.	Akuyena umuntu lo.

But it seems possible.	Kodwa kubonakala kungenzeka.
No, that is not true at all.	Cha, akulona iqiniso nhlobo.
He could not take pictures.	Akakwazanga ukuthatha izithombe.
I'm not so sure about that either.	Angiqiniseki kakhulu ngalokho futhi.
I want you to stay here.	Ngifuna uhlale lapha.
He knows many things.	Wazi izinto eziningi.
He was surprised to hear that.	Wamangala ukuzwa lokho.
I need one.	Ngidinga eyodwa.
My mother also asked me why.	Naye umama wangibuza ukuthi kungani.
But there is.	Kodwa kukhona.
Unless there is a drive, nothing happens.	Ngaphandle uma kukhona ukushayela, akukho okwenzekayo.
The most common.	Okwenzeka kakhulu.
I said, thank you very much but no thank you.	Ngathi, ngiyabonga kakhulu kodwa cha ngiyabonga.
And my father did not know.	Futhi ubaba akazange azi.
Not too fast, but not too little.	Hhayi ngokushesha kakhulu, kodwa hhayi kancane kakhulu.
He plays football.	Udlala ibhola.
All of that may have to happen.	Konke lokho kungase kudingeke kwenzeke.
I will do it all again.	Ngizokwenza konke futhi.
He looked at his age.	Wabheka iminyaka yakhe.

In my work.	Emsebenzini wami.
It should not be so difficult.	Akufanele kube nzima kangako.
I couldn't wait to try one.	Angikwazanga ukulinda ukuzama eyodwa.
But sometimes later.	Kodwa ngezinye izikhathi kamuva.
That would be a lie.	Lokho kungaba amanga.
I really had to.	Kwadingeka ngempela.
Not a good thing.	Akuyona into enhle.
I think he can do it.	Ngicabanga ukuthi angakwenza.
She is beautiful.	Muhle.
Good.	Kuhle.
You need to get out of there.	Udinga ukuphuma lapho.
I know you would not.	Ngiyazi ubengeke.
You need to help people.	Udinga ukusiza abantu.
I need to choose	Ngidinga ukukhetha
Not just in the beginning.	Hhayi nje ekuqaleni.
He wanted to live without me.	Wayefuna ukuphila ngaphandle kwami.
It should not have been.	Bekungafanele.
I just can’t do that.	Angikwazi nje ukuthi ngikwenze lokho.
I don't know, it's not.	Angazi, akunjalo.
When he spoke, he did not mention him.	Lapho ekhuluma, akazange akhulume ngaye.
I never had it.	Angizange ngibe nakho.
I don't have to know anything else.	Akumele ngazi enye into.
I don't really understand why right now.	Angiqondi kahle ukuthi kungani okwamanje.
Mother's name, for now.	Umama igama, okwamanje.
He is here.	Ukhona lapha.
Nobody does anything wrong with it.	Akekho owenza okubi ngakho.
I would never tell anyone about it.	Bengingeke ngitshele muntu ngakho.
But man will not.	Kodwa umuntu ngeke.
If you want to know.	Uma ufuna ukwazi.
Death would be nice.	Ukufa kungaba kuhle.
But in reality it is not.	Kodwa empeleni akunjalo.
Living my life, my life.	Ukuphila impilo yami, impilo yami.
He knew that he did not have to try too hard.	Wayazi ukuthi kwakungadingeki azame kanzima kakhulu.
He will never be there again.	Ngeke aphinde abe lapho.
But he began to think about it.	Kodwa waqala ukucabanga ngakho.
That is a good question.	Umbuzo omuhle lowo.
And it will not be.	Futhi ngeke kube.
And he didn't want to.	Futhi wayengafuni.
He did not know how he got here.	Wayengazi ukuthi ufike kanjani lapha.
Let's do it right.	Ake sikwenze kahle.
I make money.	Ngenza imali.
You must.	Kumele.
Everything is OK.	Konke kulungile.
You live in trouble.	Uhlala enkingeni.
I can not sleep.	Angikwazi ukulala.
What to do?	Ukwenzani?
I knew exactly what he had done.	Ngangazi kahle ukuthi wenzeni.

Well for me.	Kahle ngami.
Very nice to come.	Kuhle kakhulu ukuza.
And now.	Futhi manje.
Let's go.	Ake sihambe.

To get there.	Ukuze ngifike lapho.
Just my thing.	Into nje yami.
Or, it has to be.	Noma, kufanele kube njalo.
I'm glad you're here today.	Ngiyajabula ukuthi ulapha namuhla.
Not immediately.	Hhayi ngaso leso sikhathi.
I know exactly what you mean.	Ngiyazi kahle ukuthi usho ukuthini.
It is very difficult to do that.	Kunzima kakhulu ukukwenza lokho.
Maybe not a good idea.	Mhlawumbe akuwona umqondo omuhle.
And that will be the one.	Futhi kuzoba nguye lowo.
But it's okay.	Kodwa kulungile.
He soon got to it.	Ngokushesha wafika kukho.
I can't go on like this.	Ngeke ngikwazi ukuqhubeka kanje.
I don't have time to do this now.	Anginaso isikhathi sokwenza lokhu manje.
She is reading a book.	Ufunda incwadi.
One has to know how to do it right.	Umuntu kufanele azi ukuthi akwenze kanjani ngendlela efanele.
But this did not happen.	Kodwa lokhu akuzange kwenzeke.
I'm talking about it here.	Ngikhuluma ngakho lapha.
He wanted her to have it all.	Wayefuna ukuthi abe nakho konke.
Thank you for that.	Ngiyabonga ngalokho.
At least at night.	Okungenani ebusuku.
I will do anything to help you, anything.	Ngizokwenza noma yini ukukusiza, noma yini.
That is what the police should do.	Yilokho okufanele kwenziwe amaphoyisa.
I did well because you did well.	Ngenze kahle ngoba wenze kahle.
I've been thinking about it.	Ngike ngacabanga ngacabanga ngakho.

I mean, always.	Ngisho, njalo.
He wanted people.	Wayefuna abantu.
I've always wanted to know about that.	Bengilokhu ngifuna ukwazi ngalokho.

At first though.	Ekuqaleni noma kunjalo.
You will be really good.	Uzoba muhle impela.
But you do not know.	Kodwa awazi.
I would like to help you.	Ngingathanda ukukusiza.

I think things.	Ngicabanga izinto.
I think that's all for now.	Ngicabanga ukuthi konke lokho okwamanje.
But before you go, let me tell you something.	Kodwa ngaphambi kokuba uhambe, ake ngikutshele okuthile.
At his age.	Eminyakeni yakhe.
I just don’t see that happening.	Angiboni nje lokho kwenzeka.
I live in the city now.	Ngihlala edolobheni manje.
This is obviously not true.	Lokhu akulona iqiniso ngokusobala.
If so, no.	Uma kunjalo, cha.
Good time, yes.	Isikhathi esihle, yebo.

And this is his place.	Futhi le ndawo yakhe.
It's harder than that, isn't it?	Kunzima kunalokho, akunjalo?
I will not be there.	Ngeke ngibe lapho.
He told my mother that he could not continue for long.	Watshela umama ukuthi ngeke akwazi ukuqhubeka isikhathi eside.
I thought of you right away.	Ngacabanga ngawe ngaso leso sikhathi.
How do you think this should be done ?.	Ucabanga ukuthi kufanele kwenziwe kanjani lokhu?.
He also did not know why he did this.	Naye wayengazi ukuthi kungani enze lokhu.
We need to go further.	Kudingeka sihambe kakhulu.
You want to come here.	Ufuna ukuza lapha.
Location, place, place.	Indawo, indawo, indawo.
It's been great.	Kube kuhle kakhulu.
At the hospital.	Esibhedlela.
But he did not say anything.	Kodwa akazange asho lutho.
But that is not the answer.	Kodwa leyo akuyona impendulo.

I know a good place.	Ngiyazi indawo enhle.
He can't sit down.	Akazi ahlale phansi.
Yes, why not.	Yebo, kungani kufanele .
And a little bit.	Futhi kancane.

For me anyway.	Kimi noma kunjalo.

There can be no mistakes in this.	Angeke abe khona amaphutha kulokhu.
He made enough money.	Wenza imali eyanele.
I like that.	Ngithanda kanjalo.
Not a mistake.	Akulona iphutha.
I can't tell you that, that's right.	Angikwazi ukukutshela lokho, kunjalo.
He should have gone to prison.	Bekufanele aye ejele.
He wants to retire in a few years.	Ufuna ukuthatha umhlalaphansi eminyakeni embalwa.
We can do nothing.	Asikwazi ukwenza lutho.
I was not sure.	Bengazi kahle.
Tomorrow, indeed, tomorrow.	Kusasa, impela, kusasa.
He started this.	Waqala lokhu.
It makes a lot of sense.	Wenza umqondo kakhulu.
He refused and left the room.	Wenqaba waphuma ekamelweni.
It does not mean that he did not.	Akusho nokuthi akazange.
Maybe it's better to say you felt it.	Mhlawumbe kungcono ukusho ukuthi wazizwa.
He wasn't really.	Wayengeyena ngempela.
But you already know that.	Kodwa uyakwazi lokho kakade.
In a very bad way.	Ngendlela embi kakhulu.
Indeed, it is.	Ngempela, kunjalo.
It's nice to be the best, but it's hard to stay there.	Kuhle ukuba ungcono kakhulu, kodwa kunzima ukuhlala lapho.
But he is not.	Kodwa akekho.
What a wonderful thing.	Yeka into enhle.
Is that really it.	Ingabe yilokho ngempela.
This is good, isn't it?	Kuhle lokhu, akunjalo?

You can't walk.	Awukwazi ukuhamba.
He lives alone.	Uhlala yedwa.
You.	Uwena.

Probably not.	Cishe ngeke.
But we know that sometimes there are.	Kodwa siyazi ukuthi ngezinye izikhathi kukhona.
Let me tell you this.	Ake ngikutshele lokhu.
So is this.	Kanjalo nalokhu.
That would be great.	Lokho kungaba kuhle.
To this day it is so.	Kuze kube namuhla kunjalo.
He often slept in the afternoon	Wayevame ukulala ntambama
No one knows when.	Akekho owaziyo ukuthi nini.
We need new music.	Sidinga umculo omusha.
Tell me why.	Ngitshele kungani.
And he did not want her to leave again.	Futhi wayengafuni ukuthi aphinde ahambe.
Now that is not true.	Manje lokho akulona iqiniso.
It may be necessary.	Kungase kudingeke.
I could not.	Nami angikwazanga.
And he is good at that.	Futhi muhle kulokho.
He spoke, of course.	Wakhuluma, kunjalo.
If there are people.	Uma kukhona abantu.

Worse if true.	Okubi kakhulu uma kuyiqiniso.
Because that will happen.	Ngoba lokho kuzokwenzeka.
Or a friend.	Noma umngane.
None of this really happened.	Akukho kulokhu okwenzeka ngempela.
In my room.	Ekamelweni lami.
All this together.	Konke lokhu ndawonye.
I wanted him to go with us.	Bengifuna ahambe nathi.
And you have to do that.	Futhi kufanele ukwenze lokho.
I wanted you to know that it is okay to do that.	Bengifuna wazi ukuthi kulungile ukwenza lokho.
You do not know what is happening.	Awazi ukuthi kwenzakalani.
And we need one.	Futhi sidinga enye.
It seems.	Kubonakala kanjalo.

I may have to leave at any time.	Kungase kudingeke ngihambe noma nini.
And that's all, you know.	Futhi yilokho konke, uyazi.
I knew how.	Ngangazi kanjani.
Nothing makes sense here.	Ayikho into eyenza umqondo lapha.
A little hopeful.	Ithemba kancane.

And he heard a voice.	Futhi wezwa izwi.
I just want to make you think.	Ngifuna nje ukukwenza ucabange.
But it is very well done.	Kodwa kwenziwe kahle kakhulu.
He will be back here tomorrow.	Uzobuya lapha kusasa.
You have to always be human.	Kufanele uhlale ungumuntu.

It probably happened last year.	Cishe kwenzeka ngonyaka odlule.
We did not leave.	Asizange sihambe.
Reading or eating.	Ukufunda noma ukudla.
Finally, months or years later.	Ekugcineni, izinyanga noma iminyaka kamuva.
It may be best to buy just one item.	Kungaba kuhle ukuthenga into eyodwa kuphela.

Now we have to go and do it.	Manje kufanele sihambe sikwenze.
Sometimes, it can be busy, however.	Ngezinye izikhathi, kungase kube matasa, noma kunjalo.
Or a party.	Noma iphathi.
I went there last week.	Ngiye khona ngesonto eledlule.
But now we know why.	Kodwa manje siyazi ukuthi kungani.

I can't talk about that.	Angikwazi ukukhuluma ngalokho.
I thought he said he wanted to help.	Bengicabanga ukuthi uthe ufuna ukusiza.
So, that's fine.	Ngalokho, kulungile.
At least not this morning.	Okungenani hhayi namuhla ekuseni.
You will not have that.	Ngeke ube nakho lokho.
It's not about me.	Akukho ngami.
He did what he could.	Wenza konke okusemandleni akhe.
I never went to school.	Angizange ngiye esikoleni.
That seems right.	Lokho kubonakala kulungile.
Not a very good friend, but a friend.	Hhayi umngane omuhle kakhulu, kodwa umngane.
To complete the repair.	Ukuqeda ukulungisa.
Very good for him.	Kuhle kakhulu kuye.
It happened in the evening.	Kwenzeke kusihlwa.
I will never say.	Angisoze ngisho.
You must go to him.	Kumele uye kuye.
Thank you very much.	Ngiyabonga kakhulu.

That can be difficult.	Lokho kungase kube nzima.
But we do not know that.	Kodwa asikwazi lokho.
Or both.	Noma sobabili.
The sooner you do it, the better.	Lapho ukwenza ngokushesha, kungcono.
What did he do? 	Wenzeni?
Or it is not just an accident.	Noma akuyona ingozi kuphela.
Do you know when the meeting will be?	Uyazi ukuthi umhlangano uzoba nini?
In the end, that is exactly what happened.	Ekugcineni, yilokho kanye okwenzeka.
You will have time.	Uzoba nesikhathi.
Later, after.	Kamuva, ngemva.
You want something more.	Ufuna okuthile okwengeziwe.

She likes to be alone.	Uthanda ukuhlala yedwa.
He travels a lot and stays away.	Uhamba kakhulu futhi uhlala engekho.
Nothing to do.	Akukho okumele kwenziwe.
Not well.	Hhayi kahle.

You want a smaller space.	Ufuna indawo encane.
And now, my baby.	Futhi manje, ingane yami.

There is now a question about it.	Kukhona manje umbuzo ngakho.
And you will know there.	Futhi uzokwazi lapho.
Making yourself happy.	Ukuzenza ujabule.

That is your truth.	Iqiniso lakho lelo.
And she is happy.	Futhi ujabule.
Would it be better.	Ingabe kungaba ngcono.

He walked over to the table.	Ahambe aye etafuleni.
I can do it if you like.	Ngingakwenza uma uthanda.
So, I don’t like it at all.	Ngakho, angithandi nhlobo.

Very people, that.	Abantu kakhulu, lokho.

He saw his gun.	Wabona isibhamu sakhe.
I don't really remember.	Angisakhumbuli ngempela.

Sitting down.	Ehlala phansi.
We want to hear from you.	Sifuna ukuzwa kuwe.
He wants to go home.	Ufuna ukuya ekhaya.

She's worried about you.	Ukhathazekile ngawe.
And you think.	Futhi ucabanga.
I don't really want to.	Angifuni ngempela.

Not fast enough.	Hhayi ngokushesha ngokwanele.
That is obvious.	Lokho kusobala.
I wanted to see what she looked like.	Bengifuna ukubona ukuthi ubukeka kanjani.
What a problem.	Yeka inkinga.
And so on and so forth.	Kanjalo njalo njalo.
But not my mother.	Kodwa hhayi umama wami.
Sooner or later, you think about everything.	Ngokushesha noma kamuva, ucabanga ngayo yonke into.
But he is trying to come to me.	Kodwa uzama ukuza kimi.
Or what happens later.	Noma kwenzekani kamuva.
I would definitely like to learn more.	Ngingathanda nakanjani ukufunda okwengeziwe.
We need to talk.	Sidinga ukukhuluma.
It's not my thing.	Akuyona into yami.
I don't want to do this all the time.	Angifuni ukwenza lokhu ngaso sonke isikhathi.
Well, obviously.	Kulungile, kusobala.
This can be a problem.	Lokhu kungaba inkinga.

You got your picture right away.	Wathola isithombe sakho ngaleso sikhathi.
You've done this before, that's right.	Wake wakwenza lokhu ngaphambili, kunjalo.
Everything looks very well done.	Konke kubukeka kwenziwe kahle kakhulu.
But he made a mistake everywhere.	Kodwa wenza iphutha yonke indawo.
There may be nothing else.	Kungase kube akukho okunye.
He readily agreed.	Wavuma ngokushesha.
He refused some food.	Wenqaba ukudla okunye.
That is not your job.	Akuwona umsebenzi wakho lowo.
I don't want to be his friend.	Angifuni ukuba umngane wakhe.
You know, too.	Uyakwazi, futhi.
You can also do the work once a year.	Ungakwazi futhi ukwenza umsebenzi kanye ngonyaka.
I want to cry.	Ngifuna ukukhala.
We are not there.	Asikho lapho.
He just said so.	Usho kanjalo nje.

You want to get to that before.	Ufuna ukufika kukho lokho ngaphambili.
And it is possible.	Futhi kungenzeka.
Nothing more.	Ayikho enye into.
He drowned hard.	Wazama kanzima.

Okay so far.	Kulungile kuze kube manje.

You are not human.	Awuyena umuntu.
It can be really hard.	Kungaba nzima ngempela.
That's one thing.	Yinto eyodwa leyo.
There is nothing he can do here.	Akukho angakwenza lapha.
Not power, but power.	Hhayi amandla, kodwa amandla.
You do not need to think.	Awudingi ukucabanga.
My message is too long.	Umlayezo wami mude kakhulu.
Yes, he says.	Yebo, uthi.
That too would be a lie.	Nalokho kungaba amanga.
Did something happen?	Ingabe kukhona okwenzekile?
Before he became.	Ngaphambi kokuba abe .
It is by no means a bad idea.	Akuwona neze umbono omubi.
But what.	Kodwa yini.

So you're trying to get there and it's really hard.	Ngakho uzama ukufika lapho futhi kunzima ngempela.
Now from the beginning if you like.	Manje kusukela ekuqaleni uma uthanda.
Where is it? ' 	Kuphi?'

But this is not, in fact, not.	Kodwa lokhu akunjalo, empeleni, akunjalo.
I have to have a lot of time.	Kufanele ngibe nesikhathi esiningi.
Finally, he spoke.	Ekugcineni, wakhuluma.
Not in this country.	Hhayi kuleli.
But there is one thing that everyone should know.	Kodwa kunento eyodwa wonke umuntu okufanele azi.
That's all he said.	Yilokho kuphela akusho.
We make noise.	Senza umsindo.
But he wanted more.	Kodwa wayefuna okwengeziwe.
Money anyway.	Imali noma kunjalo.
I don't know what he did.	Angazi ukuthi wenzani.
I was not thinking anything at the time.	Ngangingacabangi lutho ngaleso sikhathi.
Someone had to help him.	Kwadingeka othile amsize.
I know better.	Ngazi kangcono.
Probably not, at least not at all.	Cishe akunjalo, okungenani hhayi ngokuphelele.
I could not go, not now.	Angikwazanga ukuhamba, hhayi manje.
You know what you want !.	Uyazi ukuthi ufuna!.
So he did not tell anyone at first.	Ngakho akazange atshele muntu ekuqaleni.
But it has been difficult for him.	Kodwa kube nzima kuye.
But no.	Kodwa cha.
Police at the time.	Amaphoyisa ngaleso sikhathi.
He knew it was too easy.	Wayazi ukuthi kube lula kakhulu.
Would you please tell me the time?	Ngicela, ungitshele isikhathi?
I did not want to.	Ngangingafuni.
I do more.	Ngenza okwengeziwe.
He must not stay.	Akumele ahlale.
There and not there.	Lapho futhi hhayi lapho.
The boy plays the guitar every night.	Umfana udlala isiginci njalo ebusuku.
Things about you.	Izinto ngawe.
She is very beautiful.	Muhle impela.

Or even do it.	Noma ngisho ukukwenza.
My family lives there.	Umndeni wami uhlala lapho.
Or not you now.	Noma hhayi wena manje.
Gradually the music started again.	Kancane kancane umculo waqala futhi.
He hopes so.	Uthemba ukuthi kunjalo.
You know where you want to go.	Uyazi lapho ofuna ukuya khona.
She lives alone in a small house.	Uhlala yedwa endlini encane.
All this.	Konke lokhu.
How much do you make.	Wenza malini.
But yes, if the idea.	Kodwa yebo, uma umbono.
He said we would not do that.	Wathi ngeke sikwenze lokho.
It is difficult to say which one is better.	Kunzima ukusho ukuthi iyiphi engcono.
Nothing to say.	Akukho okushiwo.
He wanted his departure.	Wayefuna ukuhamba kwakhe.
And there is no need.	Futhi asikho isidingo.
It was as if he were talking to himself.	Kube sengathi ukhuluma yedwa.
She is very beautiful.	Muhle kakhulu .
Because there is nothing.	Ngoba akukho lutho.
To give up or to try.	Ukuyeka noma ukuzama.
He didn't know how he knew.	Wayengazi ukuthi wayazi kanjani.
He did not need to know why.	Kwakungadingeki azi ukuthi kungani.
And earn money.	Futhi uthole imali.
I make a lot of money.	Ngenza imali eningi.
People say that this is a good thing.	Abantu bathi yinto enhle leyo.
Now we have to go.	Manje kufanele sihambe.
This is not just for me.	Lokhu akukhona nje ngami.
Where do you work?	Usebenza kuphi?
Everything looks so much better.	Konke kubukeka kungcono kakhulu.

Good job!	Umsebenzi omuhle!
Mina.	Mina.
OK then.	Uma kunjalo, kulungile.
Good for you.	Kuhle kuwe.

His whole life he feared.	Impilo yakhe yonke wayesaba.
A real place.	Indawo ngempela.
This is your doing.	Lokhu ukwenza kwakho.
Now, very much so.	Manje, kakhulu.
I wanted to move on.	Bengifuna ukuqhubeka.
She didn't look happy.	Wayengabonakali ejabule.
Good job on this.	Muhle umsebenzi ngalokhu.
No one makes you go.	Akekho owenza ukuthi uhambe.
But sometimes.	Kodwa ngezinye izikhathi.
Now my question.	Manje umbuzo wami.
Dad goes to work every morning.	Ubaba uya emsebenzini njalo ekuseni.
And he couldn't do that.	Futhi akakwazanga ukwenza lokho.
Not in his time.	Hhayi ngesikhathi sakhe.
He says yes you can.	Uthi kunjalo ungakwazi.
He wants me and not him.	Ufuna mina hhayi yena.
I beg in this way.	Ngicela ngale ndlela.
He said nothing.	Akazange asho lutho.
At least not just for you.	Okungenani hhayi nje ngenxa yakho.
This should be.	Lokhu kufanele kube.
It should, however.	Kufanele, noma kunjalo.
All music.	Wonke umculo.
We have to get money.	Kufanele sithole imali.
Nice place.	Indawo enhle.
And you are better.	Futhi ungcono.
Everyone should talk to me.	Wonke umuntu kufanele akhulume nami.
I have to be beautiful.	Kufanele ngibe muhle.
He stayed home all day.	Wahlala ekhaya usuku lonke.
I would like to.	Ngingathanda.
He was not a man.	Wayengeyena umuntu.
That is your biggest problem.	Leyo inkinga yakho enkulu.
All right now.	Kulungile manje.
It's nothing.	Akuyona into.
Everything is better in the end.	Konke kungcono ekugcineni.
It might be better.	Kungase kube ngcono.
Once, and only once, have you been here.	Kanye, futhi kanye kuphela, uke waba lapha.
He did not speak at all.	Akazange akhulume nakancane.
This should be very helpful.	Lokhu kufanele kube usizo kakhulu.
I'm sorry it must be you.	Ngiyaxolisa kufanele kube nguwe.
I never did.	Angikaze ngikwenze.
He's just trying to figure out what to do.	Uzama nje ukuthi enzeni.
He grabbed his little coat and walked away quickly.	Wathatha ingubo yakhe encane wahamba ngokushesha.
I'm not sure yet.	Angiqiniseki okwamanje.
That would be helpful.	Lokho kungaba usizo.
When did you really arrive?	Ufike nini ngempela?
To hear, but not to hear.	Ukuzwa, kodwa hhayi ukuzwa.
But the worst.	Kodwa okubi kakhulu.
I need to find something.	Ngidinga ukuthola okuthile.
That happened a few years ago.	Lokho kwenzeka eminyakeni embalwa edlule.
She is so beautiful.	Muhle kanjalo.
This is my whole life.	Lokhu impilo yami yonke.
But he is.	Kodwa nguye.
I always ask for advice.	Ngihlale ngicela iseluleko.
I wish her doctor knew.	Ngifisa sengathi ngabe udokotela wakhe wayazi.
We do not know this at the moment.	Asikwazi nalokhu njengamanje.
But he did not come.	Kodwa akazange afike.
He did so.	Wenze njalo.
I feel confident about this.	Ngizizwa ngiqinisekile ngalokhu.
Not even to you.	Hhayi ngisho kuwe.
The only thing is, he did not want to leave.	Into kuphela ukuthi, wayengafuni ukuhamba.
But you have to stay here.	Kodwa kufanele uhlale lapha.
It was needed then.	Kwakudingeka ngaleso sikhathi.
Not a bad job.	Hhayi umsebenzi omubi.
I will do that in the morning.	Ngizokwenza lokho ekuseni.
Let me do this at least.	Ake ngenze lokhu okungenani.
I felt good.	Ngizwe kahle.
I do not know where.	Angazi ukuthi kuphi.
Yes you know.	Yebo uyazi.
He can say all the books.	Angakwazi ukusho zonke izincwadi.
But it will not happen.	Kodwa ngeke kwenzeke.
I just want to say thank you.	Ngifuna nje ukuthi ngiyabonga.
Not just me but you too.	Hhayi mina kuphela kodwa nawe.
That would be.	Lokho kungaba .
Bad.	Okubi.
I never knew why.	Angikaze ngazi ukuthi kungani.
What do you say.	Uthini.
I wasn’t really happy about it.	Angizange ngempela ngijabule ngakho.
I do not like to talk.	Angithandi ukukhuluma.
This is a very good book.	Lena incwadi enhle kakhulu.
And he told me he had to.	Futhi wangitshela ukuthi kufanele.
Not really, no.	Akunjalo ngempela, cha.
I mean, here.	Ngisho, lapha.
That's exactly right here.	Impela kunjalo lapha.
He did not know what to do.	Wayengazi ukuthi enzeni.
He said he needed his help.	Wathi udinga usizo lwakhe.
He hoped there was a place.	Wayenethemba lokuthi kukhona indawo.
You can do nothing.	Awukwazi ukwenza lutho.
I'm sure he wouldn't either.	Ngiqinisekile ukuthi naye ubengeke.
I just have to tell you.	Kumele ngikutshele nje.
I do not believe so.	Angikholwa ukuthi kunjalo.
And you know what he looks like.	Futhi uyazi ukuthi ubukeka kanjani.
You want nothing to do with him.	Awufuni lutho ngaye.
It will never happen.	Angeke kwenzeke neze.
I couldn't, of course.	Angikwazanga, kunjalo.
And he never even knew.	Futhi akakaze ngisho akwazi.
You or someone else.	Wena noma omunye umuntu.
Not a good answer.	Akuyona impendulo enhle.
Well everyone.	Kahle wonke umuntu.
Saying things but not really.	Ukusho izinto kodwa hhayi ngempela.
That you too will stay here with us now.	Ukuthi wena naye uzohlala lapha nathi manje.

Anything, really.	Noma yini, ngempela.
It happened so fast.	Kwenzeka ngokushesha okukhulu .

I want to play soccer.	Ngifuna ukudlala ibhola.
He has made our task much easier.	Wenze umsebenzi wethu waba lula kakhulu.
It looks much better.	Kubukeka kungcono kakhulu.
He will not do so.	Angeke enze njalo.
I also know that it is good for him.	Ngiyazi futhi ukuthi kuhle kuye.
And he asked what he was doing.	Futhi wabuza ukuthi wenzani.
It will take time to get there.	Kuzothatha isikhathi ukufika lapho.
He didn't want to see that.	Wayengafuni ukukubona lokho.
Yes, yes it is.	Yebo, yebo kunjalo.
We have a lot to do together.	Kuningi okumele sikwenze ndawonye.
We got our chance.	Sithole ithuba lethu.
But only weeks.	Kodwa amasonto nje kuphela.
You have been there before.	Uke waba khona ngaphambili.
Certainly not me.	Impela hhayi kimi.
The only question is when.	Umbuzo nje ukuthi nini.
It can be anyone.	Kungaba noma ubani.
No answer!	Ayikho impendulo!
I really tried.	Ngazama ngempela.
I don't think you can play my music.	Angicabangi ukuthi ungakwazi ukudlala umculo wami.
Not without his help.	Hhayi ngaphandle kosizo lwakhe.
I know one thing.	Ngazi into eyodwa.
Tell me this.	Ngitshele lokhu.
Not me, but him too.	Hhayi nami, kodwa naye.
Not here.	Hhayi lapha.
Almost none of this happened.	Cishe akukho kulokhu okwenzeka.
And have breakfast.	Futhi udle isidlo sasekuseni.
So stop doing such a big thing about it.	Ngakho yeka ukwenza into enkulu kangaka ngakho.
I mean that.	Ngisho lokho.
From then on, she was able to talk to him.	Kusukela lapho, wakwazi ukukhuluma naye.
Only his mother.	Umama wakhe kuphela.
I want to say.	Ngifuna ukusho.
I have to go first.	Kufanele ngihambe kuqala.
I'm glad to see you again.	Ngiyajabula ukukubona futhi.
He, too, obviously.	Naye, kusobala.
One way.	Enye indlela.
Not yet, though.	Hhayi okwamanje, noma kunjalo.
I talk to him almost every day.	Ngikhuluma naye cishe zonke izinsuku.
Don't you think we should go?	Awucabangi ukuthi kufanele sihambe?
He just took bad advice.	Wavele wathatha iseluleko esibi.
It would be good to end this tomorrow.	Kungaba kuhle ukuqeda lokhu kusasa.
Not my truth.	Hhayi iqiniso lami.
It is difficult to know how you feel.	Kunzima ukwazi ukuthi uzizwa kanjani.
I know very well.	Ngiyazi kakhulu.
I have to talk to you.	Kufanele ngikhulume nawe.
And tomorrow.	Futhi kusasa.
At least something like that.	Okungenani into enjalo.

I'm happy about it, of course.	Ngijabule ngakho, impela.
He died later.	Washona kamuva.
The same is true here.	Kunjalo futhi lapha.
And in fact it has been a long time.	Futhi empeleni sekunesikhathi eside.
They did not know me.	Bengazi mina.
Finding it hard to get enough sleep.	Ukuthola kunzima ukulala ngokwanele.
And great too.	Futhi enkulu futhi.
Also, a book.	Futhi, incwadi.
He has been to the hospital before.	Uke waba esibhedlela ngaphambilini.
Yes still.	Yebo namanje.
She arrived at the toilet.	Wafika endlini encane.
He’s a big and handsome guy.	Ungumfana omkhulu futhi omuhle.
That is not his job.	Akuwona umsebenzi wakhe lowo.
He did a good job.	Wenza umsebenzi omuhle.
But he did it better.	Kodwa wakwenza kangcono.
He sat alone at the party.	Wahlala yedwa emcimbini.
It could just be.	Kungaba nje.
I don't like to do that.	Angithandi ukwenza kanjalo.
Now, everyone is happy.	Manje, wonke umuntu ujabule.

You know very well.	Wazi kakhulu.
And the case.	Futhi icala.

Or, at least, you know you did it.	Noma, okungenani, uyazi ukuthi ukwenzile.
It happened like this.	Kwenzeka kanje.
This is not my life.	Akuyona impilo yami lena.
But everything else, too.	Kodwa konke okunye, futhi.
I'm scared to sleep.	Ngesaba ukulala.
He thought he wanted the same thing.	Wayecabanga ukuthi naye ufuna into efanayo.
No problem with that.	Ayikho inkinga ngalokho.
I need your advice.	Ngidinga iseluleko sakho.
He came to my class a few times.	Ufike ekilasini lami izikhathi ezimbalwa.
But nothing happened.	Kodwa akuzange kwenzeke lutho.
He must know.	Kumele azi.
But it should.	Kodwa kufanele.
I just wanted to make sure there was one.	Bengifuna nje ukwenza isiqiniseko sokuthi kukhona.
He did not know what to do again.	Wayengazi ukuthi enzeni futhi.
He knew it was true.	Wayazi ukuthi kuyiqiniso.
Yes it can.	Yebo kungaba.
He can really do it.	Angakwazi ngempela ukwenza.
He didn't really.	Akazange ngempela.
We cannot speak with him.	Asikwazi ukukhuluma naye.
A few months, now.	Izinyanga ezimbalwa, manje.
If you like staying here, it's nice and nice.	Uma uthanda ukuhlala lapha, kuhle futhi kuhle.
It may be quite a lie.	Kungase kube amanga impela.
She is actually very beautiful.	Empeleni muhle impela.
But he stayed.	Kodwa wahlala.
Nothing else.	Akukho okunye.
So hard.	Kanjalo kanzima.
Anyone can do it.	Noma ubani angakwenza.
I'll be here, no matter what.	Ngizoba lapha, noma ngabe kwenzekani.
She tried to help the child.	Wazama ukusiza ingane.
He promised to do his best.	Wathembisa ukwenza konke okusemandleni akhe.
Maybe there is.	Mhlawumbe kukhona.
I feel things.	Ngizizwa izinto.
Looks like everywhere now.	Kubukeka sengathi yonke indawo manje.
But I feel that way for myself.	Kodwa ngizizwa kanjalo kimi.
Maybe he's asleep now.	Mhlawumbe ulele manje.
Or you want to be with your family.	Noma ufuna ukuba nomndeni wakho.
There is something really wrong.	Kukhona into embi ngempela.
It wasn't him.	Kwakungeyena yena.
We really know that now.	Siyazi ngempela lokho manje.
He would not want to live.	Wayengeke afune ukuphila.
So that shouldn’t be a big deal anyway.	Ngakho lokho akufanele kube yinto enkulu noma kunjalo.
And now you.	Futhi manje wena.
'work'.	'umsebenzi'.
Exactly what happened to me.	Kahle kahle okwenzeka kimi.
Nor should it.	Akufanele futhi kube njalo.
This time too.	Ngalesi sikhathi futhi.
So that's up.	Ngakho yilokho phezulu.
Something else is happening here.	Kukhona okunye okwenzekayo lapha.
He will go.	Uzohamba.
And sometimes.	Futhi ngezinye izikhathi.
So he decided to listen to her advice.	Ngakho wanquma ukuzwa iseluleko sakhe.
Also, it is not true.	Futhi, akulona iqiniso.
So very, very good.	Ngakho kakhulu, kulungile kakhulu.
And every day he stayed longer.	Futhi zonke izinsuku wahlala isikhathi eside.

Probably not true.	Mhlawumbe akulona iqiniso.

In fact, there is now no choice.	Empeleni, manje akukho ukukhetha.
Please do not do this.	Ngicela ungakwenzi lokhu.

He could not, not in this.	Akakwazanga, hhayi kulokhu.
A few hours from now.	Amahora ambalwa kusukela manje.
Yes, that's me.	Yebo yimi lowo.
The problem with that is that it is obvious.	Inkinga ngalokho ukuthi kusobala.
I couldn’t figure out what he was doing.	Angikwazanga ukuthola ukuthi wenzani.
And we didn't.	Futhi asizange.
In the area.	Endaweni.
But, of course, he had to leave.	Kodwa, kunjalo, kwadingeka ahambe.

Gradually, a new idea took over.	Kancane kancane, umqondo omusha wathatha.

It could happen too many times.	Kungenzeka izikhathi eziningi kakhulu.
This is not the way it should be.	Lena akuyona indlela okufanele kube ngayo.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akufanele kube njalo.
Everyone should go.	Wonke umuntu kufanele ahambe.
He used to play the piano.	Wayevame ukudlala upiyano.
He started walking.	Waqala wahamba.
You have to do the right thing.	Kufanele wenze okufanele.

Let me speak.	Ake ngikhulume.
Well we do.	Kulungile senza.

Up can be down.	Phezulu kungaba phansi.
He is always happy.	Uhlale ejabule.
But he managed.	Kodwa wakwazi.
Really, there is nothing to it.	Ngempela, akukho lutho kukho.
Did he just want to know.	Ingabe nje wayefuna ukwazi.
None other than me.	Akekho omunye ngaphandle kwami.
Every night would be great.	Njalo ebusuku kungaba kuhle.
Looks like a meeting.	Kubukeka sengathi umhlangano.
All you have to do is wait.	Okufanele ukwenze ukulinda.
Now, that's not the only idea.	Manje, akuwona kuphela umbono.
That's right.	Kunjalo.
He opened it and entered.	Wavula wangena.

I'm a little excited.	Ngijabule kancane.
No, there is no food.	Cha, akukho ukudla.
You expect the most.	Ulindele okukhulu kakhulu.

Certainly not me.	Impela akumina.
You can always get three.	Ungakwazi njalo ukuthola ezintathu.

You are wrong.	Unephutha.
Something or someone.	Okuthile noma othile.
So at home and sleep.	Ngakho ekhaya futhi ukulala.
That would be difficult.	Lokho kungaba nzima.
No thanks!	Cha ngiyabonga!
He will have to make his decision.	Kuzofanele enze isinqumo sakhe.

You will do well.	Uzokwenza kahle.

You know that won't happen.	Uyazi ngeke kwenzeke lokho.

I think there is one thing.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kukhona into eyodwa.
But he needed to know one way or another.	Kodwa kwakudingeka azi indlela eyodwa noma enye.
Nothing always.	Akukho lutho njalo.

Anyone can make a mistake.	Noma ubani angenza iphutha.
He wanted to talk about this now.	Wayefuna ukukhuluma ngale ndaba manje.
Nothing.	Lutho.
You want to do it again and again.	Ufuna ukukwenza futhi futhi.
But that's it.	Kodwa leyo nto.
I could not live without you.	Bengingeke ngikwazi ukuphila ngaphandle kwakho.
But if you make a mistake.	Kodwa uma wenze iphutha.
I will do something about him.	Ngizokwenza okuthile ngaye.
Once.	Kanye.
We know how that happened.	Siyazi ukuthi lokho kwenzeka kanjani.
That sounds better.	Lokho kuzwakala kungcono.
Now and then and now, what's really here.	Manje namanje futhi manje, yini empeleni lapha.
Not so much.	Cha kakhulu.
He refused to talk about it.	Wenqaba ukukhuluma ngakho.
It is not a big job if you do it well.	Akuwona umsebenzi omkhulu uma wenza kahle.
Everyone needs a car today!	Wonke umuntu udinga imoto namuhla!
Coffee has been a big mistake.	Ikhofi kube iphutha elikhulu.
But not now, not like this.	Kodwa hhayi manje, hhayi kanje.

Does that sound right?	Ingabe lokho kuzwakala kulungile?
I apologize for everything.	Ngiyaxolisa ngakho konke.
Too long.	Isikhathi eside kakhulu.

He is the only doctor in the area.	Uyena yedwa udokotela endaweni.
You will get better, you will get better.	Uzoba ngcono, uzoba ngcono.

Not today though.	Hhayi namuhla kodwa.
You read a lot.	Ufunda kakhulu.

All we have to do is say a word.	Okufanele sikwenze nje ukusho izwi.
The rest means nothing.	Okunye akusho lutho.
He has something to say about this.	Kukhona okumele akusho ngalokhu.
He finally let out a sigh.	Ekugcineni wakhipha umoya.
Very good indeed.	Kuhle kakhulu impela.
I would love to do that again.	Ngingathanda ukwenza lokho futhi.
It didn't have to be.	Kwakungadingeki kube khona.
You are not a doctor.	Awuyena udokotela.
Do not do this to me.	Ungakwenzi lokhu kimi.
I do not have time.	Anginaso isikhathi.
Everyone is beautiful too.	Wonke umuntu muhle naye.
This has to happen.	Lokhu kufanele kwenzeke.

We make it easy.	Senza kube lula.
Probably a lot of things.	Mhlawumbe izinto eziningi.

He refused to say anything.	Wenqaba ukusho lutho.
But there is no such thing.	Kodwa ayikho into enjalo.
You better hope so.	Kungcono uthemba kanjalo.
But you did not say.	Kodwa awuzange usho.

Everything has been so.	Konke kube njalo.

But that doesn't mean he doesn't exist.	Kodwa lokho akusho ukuthi akekho.

Finally he arrived.	Ekugcineni wafika.
Not at all.	Ngisho neze.
Now he looked up.	Manje wabheka phezulu.
You will need to leave immediately.	Uzodinga ukuhamba ngokushesha.
What a waste of time!	Yeka ukuchitha isikhathi!
But let me tell you this.	Kodwa ake ngikutshele lokhu.

Reading my life.	Ukufunda impilo yami.
Everyone was amazed.	Wonke umuntu wamangala.
I thought about it.	Ngacabanga ngakho.
If you live.	Uma uhlala.
Being here with you is not a good idea.	Ukuba lapha nawe akuwona umqondo omuhle.

And he was scared.	Futhi wayesaba.
For years, almost.	Eminyakeni, cishe.
I want to swim a lot.	Ngifuna ukubhukuda kakhulu .

It was really clear.	Kwacaca ngempela.
I'm just glad to see you.	Ngijabule nje ukukubona.
You do this well.	Ukwenza kahle lokhu.
But he stayed in his place.	Kodwa wahlala endaweni yakhe.
He did it as soon as he got home.	Wakwenza efika nje ekhaya.
And maybe he can.	Futhi mhlawumbe angase.
He could not stay here long.	Akakwazanga ukuhlala isikhathi eside lapha.
What is the proper way to do this?	Iyiphi indlela efanele yokwenza lokhu.
He did this many times.	Wenza le nto kaningi.
Man, to be very beautiful.	Umuntu, ukuba muhle kakhulu.
Maybe he shouldn’t have done anything.	Mhlawumbe kwakungafanele enze lutho.
You have done this before.	Uke wakwenza lokhu ngaphambilini.
He is just there for me.	Ukhona nje kimi.
What do you say now.	Uthini manje.

Death.	Ukufa.
Or trying to be.	Noma uzama ukuba.
True! 	Iqiniso!
He found the door.	Wathola umnyango.
He just wouldn't do it.	Ubengeke nje akwenze.
That is possible now.	Ukuthi kungenzeka manje.
Thirty years earlier, maybe.	Eminyakeni engamashumi amathathu ngaphambili, mhlawumbe.
He knows everything.	Wazi konke.
My mother went there.	Umama waya khona.
You must go with me.	Kuzomele uhambe nami.
He did not go anywhere.	Akazange aye ndawo.
Probably not everywhere.	Mhlawumbe hhayi yonke indawo.
He did, too.	Wenza, futhi.
And there is nothing about him.	Futhi akukho lutho ngaye.
Do you need help with your homework?	Ingabe ufuna usizo ngomsebenzi wakho wesikole?
My children, too.	Izingane zami, futhi.

But not in this way.	Kodwa hhayi ngale ndlela.
He does not want to go now.	Akafuni ahambe manje.
But that is not your problem.	Kodwa akuyona inkinga yakho.
We have to do that.	Kufanele sikwenze lokho.
He can hardly imagine.	Akakwazi neze ukucabanga.
However, nothing happens immediately.	Noma kunjalo, akukho okwenzeka ngokushesha.
She is trying to swim.	Uzama ukubhukuda.
I always lie.	Ngikhuluma amanga njalo.
You should have stayed with me.	Bekufanele uhlale nami.

Good friend, I say.	Umngane omuhle, ngisho.
Nothing too small.	Ayikho into encane kakhulu.
But it cannot be done this way.	Kodwa angeke kwenziwe kanje.

I never thought it would happen to me.	Ngangingacabangi ukuthi kuzokwenzeka kimi.
She's really good, but she has nothing to do with it.	Impela muhle, kodwa akukho nhlobo okumele akwenze.
She is scared and worried.	Uyesaba futhi ukhathazekile.
You better say yes.	Kungcono uthi yebo.

I will be behind you.	Ngizoba ngemuva kwakho.
Right now.	Njengamanje.

We make a big team.	Senza iqembu elikhulu.
But me.	Kodwa mina.
I'm not sure what to do.	Angiqiniseki ukuthi ngenzeni.
It really happened.	Kwenzekeni ngempela.
But, for now, there is nothing else he can do.	Kodwa, okwamanje, akukho okunye angakwenza.
I don’t want anyone to know, actually.	Angifuni noma ubani azi, empeleni.
He decided on this.	Wanquma kulokhu.
Sit in the car.	Ahlale emotweni.
What are you doing now? 	Wenzani manje?
Would that be a good way?	Kungaba indlela enhle leyo?
The whole house.	Indlu yonke.
He wondered if it would be better.	Wazibuza ukuthi ngabe kungcono yini.
I just can't.	Angikwazi nje.
The road to his house.	Indlela eya endlini yakhe.
Better, he thought.	Kungcono, wacabanga.
He too was not a man.	Naye wayengeyena umuntu.
I am so happy to be helpful.	Ngijabule kakhulu ukuba usizo.
There must be something he can do to help his friends.	Kumele kube khona angakwenza ukuze asize abangani bakhe.
I thought it was good.	Bengicabanga ukuthi kuhle.
It's me, just so you know.	Yimi, ukuze wazi nje.
Maybe a little too much.	Mhlawumbe kancane kakhulu.
Yes, yes and no.	Yebo, yebo futhi cha.
And so it has been.	Futhi kube njalo.
So it could be that.	Ngakho kungaba yilokho.
His family does not know this.	Umndeni wakhe awukwazi lokhu.
That is not a bit dangerous.	Ukuthi akuyona ingozi kancane.
I will do that if you want me to do so.	Ngizokwenza lokho uma uthanda ukuthi ngenze njalo.
It actually happened that way.	Empeleni kwenzeka kanjalo.
I don’t like to talk about it too much.	Angithandi ukukhuluma ngakho kakhulu.
But that doesn't mean much.	Kodwa lokhu akusho okuningi ngempela.
You know when.	Uyazi nini.
You can or may not.	Awukwazi noma ngeke.
He's a good boy, such a good boy.	Ungumfana omuhle, umfana omuhle kanje .
You want one.	Ufuna enye.
But it is better at night.	Kodwa kungcono ebusuku.
But there are a few questions.	Kodwa kukhona imibuzo embalwa.
A long time, too.	Isikhathi eside, futhi.
I do not want to be here.	Angifuni ukuba lapha.
I'm sure that	Ngiqinisekile ukuthi
I sit down.	Ngihlala phansi.
Good job.	Muhle umsebenzi.
But she also felt happy.	Kodwa naye wazizwa ejabule.
I want you to be beautiful.	Ngifuna ukuba muhle.
He should not have been.	Kwakungafanele abe khona.
My children.	Izingane zami.
But do not do that.	Kodwa ungakwenzi lokho.
How nice to come.	Kuhle kangakanani ukuza.
This is not a bad thing at all.	Lokhu akuyona into embi.
Someone has to know something.	Kukhona okumele azi okuthile.
He makes coffee.	Wenza ikhofi.
It's not dangerous, though.	Akuyona ingozi, kodwa.
And he did not do that.	Futhi akakwenzanga lokho.
I do not know what you are talking about.	Angazi ukuthi ukhuluma ngani.
I tried to say.	Ngazama ukusho.
To relieve pain.	Ukuqeda ubuhlungu.
This is a very serious problem.	Lena inkinga enkulu kakhulu.
A good marriage requires work.	Umshado omuhle udinga umsebenzi.
Anyway, at first.	Noma kunjalo, ekuqaleni.
Nice party.	Iphathi enhle.
Or is it.	Noma ingabe.
You should too.	Kufanele nawe kanjalo.
I can't go to him.	Angikwazi ukuya kuye.
You do not need to do this.	Awudingi ukwenza lokhu.
He was very scared.	Wayesaba kakhulu.
He knew it all at once.	Wakwazi konke ngesikhathi esisodwa.
I think that would be a problem.	Ngicabanga ukuthi lokho kungaba inkinga.
That's great.	Lokho kuhle kakhulu.
He never came home.	Akazange afike ekhaya.
It will not happen.	Ngeke kwenzeke .
I want it to happen.	Ngifuna kwenzeke.
You can't do that.	Ngeke ukwenze lokho.
I'm not sure about everything.	Angiqiniseki ngakho konke.
He does not want to come.	Akafuni ukuza.
You need to log out.	Udinga ukuphuma.
I saw some more.	Ngabona okunye okwengeziwe.
It was not his mother.	Kwakungeyena umama wakhe.
I can no longer speak.	Angisakwazi ukukhuluma.
Because it might help you.	Ngoba kungase kube usizo kuwe.
I'm glad you're coming.	Ngiyajabula ukuthi uyeza.
But it happened this way.	Kodwa kwenzeka ngale ndlela.
Or not really.	Noma akunjalo ngempela.
You just can't do anything about it.	Ngeke nje wenze lutho ngakho.
He did what he wanted to do.	Wenza into afuna ukuyenza.
He could not speak for a moment.	Akakwazanga ukukhuluma isikhashana.
But it must be done !.	Kodwa kumele kwenziwe!.
I wanted that with him.	Ngangifuna lokho naye.
This happened last week.	Lokhu kwenzeke ngesonto eledlule.
He took the money and went with him.	Wathatha imali wahamba naye.
What an idea.	Yeka umqondo.
That is very difficult for me.	Kunzima kakhulu kimi lokho.
He refused to work overtime.	Wenqaba ukusebenza isikhathi esengeziwe.
I'm sure you know that.	Ngiqinisekile ukuthi uyakwazi lokho.
But for now.	Kodwa okwamanje.
No riding his bike.	Cha ukugibela ibhayisikili lakhe.
He told me so.	Wangitshela kanjalo.
Speak quickly.	Akhulume ngokushesha.
A voice behind me.	Izwi ngemuva kwami.
He reads as he walks.	Ufunda njengoba ehamba.
But he is a good man.	Kodwa ungumuntu omuhle.
Just another thing.	Enye into nje.
To be with him.	Ukuba naye.
That's just my way.	Indlela yami nje leyo.
That is absolutely true.	Lokho kuyiqiniso ngokuphelele.
You think too much and not at all.	Ucabanga kakhulu hhayi nhlobo.
I wonder if it will be me soon.	Kazi kuzoba yimina maduze nje.
But sometimes there is nothing as it seems.	Kodwa ngezinye izikhathi akukho lutho njengoba kubonakala.
You don't want to, of course.	Awufuni, kusobala.
First, she had to learn more about him.	Okokuqala kwakufanele afunde okwengeziwe ngaye.
There is no right way.	Ayikho indlela efanele.
So there is that.	Ngakho kukhona lokho.
I do not know.	Angazi kodwa.
Apparently, he saw.	Ngokusobala, wabona.
This is very clear.	Lokhu kusobala impela.
So.	Ngakho .
He just couldn't.	Akakwazanga nje.
A moment here.	Isikhashana lapha.
I don't want to do that either.	Nami angifuni ukukwenza lokho.
Really, really.	Ngempela, ngempela.
I have to tell you something.	Kufanele ngikutshele okuthile.
He didn't think about it.	Wayengacabangi ngakho.
And you know you can do it.	Futhi uyazi ukuthi ungakwenza.
He knew nothing about what had happened to him.	Wayengazi lutho ngokwenzekile kuye.
Can you prepare dinner tonight?	Ungakwazi yini ukulungisa ukudla namuhla kusihlwa?
It is not his fault.	Akulona iphutha lakhe.
Thank you, that's great.	Ngiyabonga, kuhle kakhulu lokho.
Yes you read well.	Yebo ufunda kahle.
I didn’t know how to do it all the time.	Bengazi ukukwenza ngaso sonke isikhathi.
If only something.	Uma nje okuthile.
I am the one who has to go.	Yimi okumele ngihambe.
But, he likes to talk a lot.	Kodwa, uthanda ukukhuluma kakhulu.
I would really like to see someone new.	Ngingathanda ngempela ukubona umuntu omusha.
You got here on time.	Ufike lapha ngesikhathi.
A decision must be made.	Kumele kwenziwe isinqumo.
But he wanted to know.	Kodwa wayefuna ukwazi.
Obviously, he wanted to keep talking.	Ngokusobala, wayefuna ukuqhubeka ekhuluma.
But that would be a complete mistake.	Kodwa lokho kungaba iphutha ngokuphelele.
Please see the teacher immediately.	Ngicela ukubona uthisha ngokushesha.
I don't see a problem with it.	Angiboni nkinga ngayo.
You found someone else.	Uthole omunye umuntu.
In your house.	Endlini yakho.
And we really don't know much about it yet.	Futhi empeleni asikwazi okuningi ngakho okwamanje.
I would not have done it without you.	Bengingeke ngikwenze ngaphandle kwakho.
This is such a bad book.	Lena incwadi embi kangaka.
It's not your fault, though.	Akulona iphutha lakho, kunjalo.
All right, think of me, that's fine.	Kulungile, ucabange ngami, kuhle.
This is not a new problem.	Lena akuyona inkinga entsha.
Or rather it is still early.	Noma kunalokho kusenesikhathi.
Very good for you.	Kuhle kakhulu kuwe.
Like me, today.	Njengami, namuhla.
You are like me and you.	Ufana nami nawe.
I don't want to hear about it.	Angifuni ukuzwa ngayo.
I needed to know more.	Kwadingeka ngazi okwengeziwe.
Someone will do it, too.	Omunye uzokwenza, futhi.
At this, he even surprised her.	Kulokhu, wamangala ngisho naye.
Don't ever forget that.	Ungakhohlwa njalo lokho.
Not tomorrow or a few months from now.	Hhayi kusasa noma izinyanga ezimbalwa kusukela manje.
What is that?	Yini leyo?
You do not know.	Awazi nawe.
I would not stay.	Bengingeke ngihlale.
Finally, he sat down for a while.	Ekugcineni, wahlala phansi kancane.
At least not without.	Okungenani hhayi ngaphandle.
He does some things first.	Wenza ezinye izinto kuqala.
Your job now.	Umsebenzi wakho manje.
Not so there.	Akunjalo lapho.
We know.	Siyazi.
But for now you do not have to do anything.	Kodwa okwamanje asikho isidingo sokuthi wenze okuthile.
He will never do anything else.	Ngeke aphinde akwenze lutho.
I always think about this anyway.	Ngihlale ngicabanga ngalokhu kunjalo.
You will be there.	Uya kukho.
Everyone.	Wonke umuntu.
He refused to come.	Wenqaba ukuza.
She looked very happy.	Wayebukeka ejabule kakhulu.
He said he was not sure.	Wathi akanaso isiqiniseko.
He does not want to talk.	Akafuni ukukhuluma.
You know nothing.	Awazi lutho.
Or, well.	Noma, kahle.
Fast, fast.	Ngokushesha, ngokushesha.
What really happened.	Okwenzeka ngempela.
That's just true.	Lokho kuyiqiniso nje.
I can't wait to see everything.	Angisakwazi ukulinda ukubona yonke into.
If you are serious about this, you will need to work hard.	Uma uzimisele ngalokhu, uzodinga ukusebenza kanzima.
And you need to stop.	Futhi udinga ukuyeka.
I speak.	Ngikhuluma .
Just a book.	Incwadi nje.
It is also possible.	Kungenzeka futhi.
I can't imagine.	Angikwazi ukucabanga.
For many years.	Iminyaka eminingi.
It can be difficult.	Kungaba nzima.
And before.	Futhi ngaphambili.
I have to know.	Kumele ngazi.
Maybe not because of you but me.	Mhlawumbe hhayi ngenxa yakho kodwa mina.
He will never do this again.	Ngeke aphinde akwenze lokhu.
We know where you live.	Siyazi lapho uhlala khona.
Not only that.	Hhayi lokho kuphela.
At least, not too much.	Okungenani, hhayi kakhulu.
Because we are not.	Ngoba asikho.
You have to make a decision.	Kufanele wenze isinqumo.
It's okay with me anyway.	Kulungile kimi noma kanjani.
He did not eat breakfast.	Akazange adle isidlo sasekuseni.
This will not happen.	Lokhu ngeke kwenzeke.
How do you do this?	Ukwenza kanjani lokhu?
It took a long time.	Wathatha isikhathi eside.
No, he thought.	Cha, wacabanga.
You do not need it now.	Awudingi manje.
I never talked about him.	Angikaze ngikhulume ngaye.
Everyone is moving slowly.	Wonke umuntu uhamba kancane.
He is very determined.	Uzimisele kakhulu.
Why he.	Kungani yena.
I don't want to see anything.	Angifuni ukubona lutho.
He never had that.	Akazange abe nakho lokho.
I've never heard of him.	Angikaze ngizwe ngaye.
I think we should do this together.	Ngicabanga ukuthi lokhu kufanele sikwenze ndawonye.
No one knows except me.	Akekho owaziyo ngaphandle kwami.
There is one thing.	Kukhona into eyodwa.
And I'm really happy.	Futhi ngijabule ngempela.
Probably not necessary.	Mhlawumbe asikho isidingo.
And it's good.	Futhi kuhle.
So he can be with her.	Ngakho angaba naye.
She looked surprised.	Wayebonakala emangele.
Not many, perhaps.	Hhayi abaningi, mhlawumbe.
The only way if you do it in your home.	Indlela kuphela uma ukwenza ekhaya lakho.
Almost everyone, though.	Cishe wonke umuntu, noma kunjalo.
But he can't have this.	Kodwa akakwazi ukuba nalokhu.
And he did that.	Futhi wakwenza lokho.
That's all.	Yilokho konke.
That's exactly right for me.	Kunjalo ngempela kimi.
How did he do it?	Wakwenza kanjani?
That's not me.	Akumina lowo.
I would like to see a picture of her.	Ngingathanda ukubona isithombe sakhe.
This actually happened a lot.	Lokhu empeleni kwenzeka kakhulu.
You can't come.	Awukwazi ukuza.
The same is true of this.	Kunjalo nalokhu.
I must not wait.	Akumele ngilinde.
He wants to go to college.	Ufuna ukuya ekolishi.
I really do not believe it will happen.	Angikholwa ngempela ukuthi kuzokwenzeka.
And still nothing.	Futhi namanje lutho.
Not at all to me.	Akukhona neze kimi.
But he spoke anyway.	Kodwa wakhuluma noma kunjalo.
And, that's perfectly fine.	Futhi, lokho kulungile ngokuphelele.
I really wanted to say thank you.	Bengifuna ngempela ukuthi ngiyabonga.
We must leave immediately.	Kufanele sihambe ngokushesha.
Maybe that's good.	Mhlawumbe lokho kuhle.
You will not be able to reach him.	Ngeke ukwazi ukufika kuye.
But the picture.	Kodwa isithombe.
Just as anywhere.	Njengoba nje kuphi.
At least, to us.	Okungenani, kithi.
Not as it should be.	Hhayi njengoba kufanele.
You made money last year.	Wenze imali ngonyaka odlule.
Let me say this.	Ake ngisho lokhu.
Excellent dinner, too.	Isidlo sakusihlwa esihle kakhulu, futhi.
And this is not just my opinion.	Futhi lokhu akuwona nje umbono wami.
I wish I could not.	Ngifisa sengathi ngeke.
So yes, in case it happens.	Ngakho yebo, uma kwenzeka kwenzeka.
As it is true.	Njengoba kuyiqiniso.
Now it has to be so life.	Manje kufanele kube njalo ukuphila.
At least he seemed to be alone.	Okungenani wayebonakala eyedwa.
I am the one who should be with him.	Yimina okufanele ube naye.
This is a completely new way of doing things.	Lena indlela entsha ngokuphelele yokwenza izinto.
He spoke for a long time.	Wakhuluma isikhathi eside.
No one else should know.	Akekho omunye umuntu okufanele azi.
I had no idea what had happened.	Ngangingazi ukuthi kwenzekeni.
And what else.	Futhi yini enye.
Then to me.	Khona kimi.
He would not tell anyone bad things.	Ubengeke atshele muntu into embi.
Lots of money.	Imali eningi.
He's just trying to help.	Uzama nje ukusiza.
I did not want to live without her.	Ngangingafuni ukuphila ngaphandle kwakhe.
Sleeping in the house can be very difficult.	Ukulala endlini kungaba nzima kakhulu.
He just wanted to eat.	Wayefuna ukudla nje.
That's a good thing that happened.	Lokho kuhle kakhulu okwenzekile.
I don't want that to be me.	Angifuni kube yimina lowo.
The doctor says she feels better.	Udokotela uthi uzizwa engcono.
Almost everyone.	Cishe wonke umuntu.
You should be able to see through it.	Kufanele ukwazi ukubona ngakho.
This is the problem.	Inkinga lena.
Let him do this.	Akwenze lokhu.
He's just a young man.	Uyinsizwa nje.
You have to do something.	Kufanele wenze okuthile.
There will be no one else.	Angeke kube khona omunye.
She is very good to him.	Muhle kakhulu kuye.
You should know better than that.	Kufanele wazi kangcono kunalokho.
I'm trying to find another job.	Ngizama ukuthola omunye umsebenzi.
You have been so good to me.	Ube muhle kakhulu kimi.
I will never dwell on that again.	Ngeke ngiphinde ngihlale kulokho.
I will not go with him.	Ngeke ngihambe naye.
But everywhere.	Kodwa yonke indawo.
I hope you can.	Ngethemba ukuthi ungakwenza.
Why this is happening.	Kungani lokhu kwenzeka.
Not talking to him, of course.	Hhayi ukukhuluma naye, impela.
I want to finish my work here.	Ngifuna ukuqeda umsebenzi wami lapha.
He's just trying to do the right thing.	Uzama nje ukwenza okufanele.
It is very difficult to earn money.	Kunzima kakhulu ukuthola imali.
There is that at least.	Kukhona lokho okungenani.
Finally, he agreed.	Ekugcineni, wavuma.
Just my son again.	Indodana yami nje futhi.
And he and I.	Futhi yena nami.
They said the baby would be a boy.	Bathi ingane ngabe umfana.
That's the big risk.	Yilokho ingozi enkulu.
But not a child.	Kodwa hhayi ingane.
He should have been able to help.	Bekufanele akwazi ukusiza.
I think this might be a problem.	Ngicabanga ukuthi lokhu kungase kube inkinga.
Now the problem.	Manje inkinga.
We should not be.	Akufanele sibe njalo.
He didn't talk much.	Akazange akhulume kakhulu.
You have done this before.	Uke wakwenza lokhu ngaphambili.
Have him very close.	Ube naye eduze kakhulu.
Good idea.	Icebo elihle.
How but ?.	Kanjani kodwa?.
That would be okay.	Lokho kungaba kulungile.
But he could not find any other way.	Kodwa akakwazanga ukubona enye indlela.
It has to be someone else.	Kufanele kube omunye umuntu.
Nothing else is done about it.	Akukho okunye okwenziwa ngakho.
I say no.	Ngisho cha.
You know it well.	Wazi kahle.
Not a good idea.	Akuwona umbono omuhle.
You expect more from him.	Ulindele okwengeziwe kuye.
Just being there.	Ukuba khona nje.
It's not such a big deal.	Akuyona into enkulu kangaka.
That would be a mistake.	Lokho kungaba iphutha.
He can drive.	Uyakwazi ukushayela.
Definitely beautiful.	Nakanjani muhle.
That's another one.	Lowo omunye.
I'm not sure how to do it.	Angazi kahle ukuthi ukwenza kanjani.
I'm not sure about you.	Angiqiniseki ngawe.
Sometimes you have to.	Ngezinye izikhathi kufanele.
He did what he did.	Wenza akwenzile.
And he didn't know.	Futhi wayengazi.
You feel so much better now.	Uzizwa engcono kakhulu manje.
So, there is no help there.	Ngakho, akukho usizo lapho.
And it doesn't deserve anyone.	Futhi akufanele muntu.
Or make dinner.	Noma ukwenza isidlo sakusihlwa.
It’s you and you know it.	Nguwe futhi uyazi.
Very badly done.	Kwenziwe kabi kakhulu.
Your friend.	Umngane wakho.
Please go without me.	Ngicela uhambe ngaphandle kwami.
You only need to do it once.	Udinga ukukwenza kanye kuphela.
There is nothing wrong with that, though.	Akukho okubi, noma kunjalo.
I do not want that to happen to me.	Angifuni lokho kwenzeke kimi.
And he wanted to do it right.	Futhi wayefuna ukukwenza ngendlela efanele.
It will happen soon.	Kuzokwenzeka maduze.
That is not all.	Akukhona lokho kuphela.
That's one thing.	Enye into leyo.
We make a living.	Senza ukuphila.
This happened once.	Lokhu kwenzeka kanye.
This is very true.	Lokhu kuyiqiniso impela.
Yes, in the office.	Yebo, ehhovisi.
He did not, once.	Akazange, kanye.
We need a doctor immediately.	Sidinga udokotela ngokushesha.
He simplified that.	Wakwenza lula lokho.
I try hard.	Ngizama kanzima.
He knows all about it.	Wazi konke ngakho.
I did not really want to die.	Ngangingafuni ngempela ukufa.
Tell me why you are here.	Ngitshele ukuthi kungani ulapha.
He wanted to say more.	Wayefuna ukusho okwengeziwe.
Maybe that's what happened here.	Mhlawumbe yilokho okwenzeka lapha.
It's hard to imagine.	Kunzima ukucabanga.
It's hard to imagine now.	Kunzima ukucabanga manje.
I do not want to get married.	Angifuni ukushada.
Because of him.	Ngenxa yakhe.
He says I arrived tomorrow.	Uthi ngifike kusasa.
Have you tried another dress?	Uke wazama enye ingubo?
Yes, that's better.	Yebo, lokho kungcono.
I need to think about this.	Ngidinga ukucabanga ngalokhu.
But in this case, he would have to do so.	Kodwa kulokhu kuzofanele enze njalo.
If this.	Uma lokhu.
I can no longer.	Angisakwazi.
Like you never said that.	Sengathi awuzange usho lokho.
I have never heard of him until today.	Angikaze ngizwe ngaye kuze kube namuhla.
He said no, no he would not do that.	Wathi cha, cha angeke akwenze lokho.
It is not his gift.	Akusona isipho sakhe.
But it should not be.	Kodwa akufanele kube khona.
He often does.	Uvame ukwenza kanjalo.
He did not know how he knew this.	Wayengazi ukuthi ukwazi kanjani lokhu.
No it is true.	Cha kuyiqiniso.
I want you to know.	Ngifuna wazi.
I found an error.	Ngithole iphutha.
He could not say why.	Wayengeke asho ukuthi kungani.
Says one of us.	Uthi omunye wethu.
He wanted to say the right thing and sit down.	Wayefuna ukusho into efanele ahlale phansi.
But no one knows.	Kodwa akekho owaziyo.
You know the way is not right.	Uyazi ukuthi indlela ayikho.
Have you ever thought about me.	Uke wacabanga ngami.
You know what you want.	Uyazi ukuthi uyafuna.
There is not enough time.	Asikho isikhathi esanele.
As many people as possible.	Abantu abaningi ngangokunokwenzeka.
I will not go away for long.	Ngeke ngihambe isikhathi eside.
I will not do that.	Ngeke ngikwenze lokho.
I did not find a reason.	Angizange ngithole isizathu.
It won't be too long now.	Ngeke kube isikhathi eside kakhulu manje.
Not our problem.	Akuyona inkinga yethu.
He refused to do so.	Wenqaba ukwenza kanjalo.
She has been really good.	Ube muhle impela.
I would like to know more about this place.	Ngingathanda ukwazi okwengeziwe ngale ndawo.
I don’t know much at the time.	Angazi okuningi ngaleso sikhathi.
I will not be here.	Ngeke ngibe lapha.
Maybe just me.	Mhlawumbe mina kuphela.
Good to be here.	Kuhle ukuba lapha.
But no image.	Kodwa asikho isithombe.
And he should not go there.	Futhi akufanele aye lapho.
I need to work fast.	Ngidinga ukusebenza ngokushesha.
I have never had to.	Angikaze kudingeke.
We know about it now though.	Siyazi ngakho manje kodwa.
Only one gun.	Isibhamu esisodwa kuphela.
Or read about it.	Noma ufunda ngakho.
i don't want you to think about me.	angifuni ukuthi ucabange ngami.
He didn't want to get out of bed.	Wayengafuni ukuphuma embhedeni.
I need to tell my man.	Ngidinga ukutshela umuntu wami.
Thank you so much, that's all.	Ngiyabonga kakhulu, yilokho kuphela.
You work there, too.	Usebenza lapho, futhi.
I need everyone to do their job.	Ngidinga wonke umuntu enze umsebenzi wakhe.
I have never been like that.	Angikaze ngibe njalo.
I did not think so.	Bengingacabangi ukuthi kunjalo.
All together.	Sonke ndawonye.
Let me help you.	Ake ngisize.
He looked around the room, but saw nothing.	Wabheka lonke igumbi, kodwa wabona lutho.
There is no reason to do so yet.	Asikho isizathu sokwenza lokho okwamanje.
I always think so with you.	Ngihlale ngicabanga kanjalo nawe.
At least not to him.	Okungenani hhayi kuye.
Worse, learning to live with it.	Okubi, ukufunda ukuphila nakho.
No his.	Cha wakhe.
I do this perfectly.	Ngenza lokhu ngokuphelele.
And, the same thing.	Futhi, into efanayo.
But I ask for help.	Kodwa ngicela usizo.

He has never seen anyone else yet.	Akakaze abone omunye umuntu kuze kube manje.
And so it is, indeed.	Futhi kunjalo, ngempela.
You have to make money.	Kufanele wenze imali.
We are not going anywhere today.	Ngeke siye ndawo namuhla.

Do something.	Enza into.
You think too much.	Ucabanga kakhulu.
That's fine too.	Kulungile futhi.
See you and not be with you.	Ukubona futhi ungabi nawe.

He was amazed that he could not do it.	Wamangala ukuthi wayengeke akwazi ukukwenza.
I think this is true.	Ngicabanga ukuthi lokhu kuyiqiniso.
Everyone says it well, but it is difficult.	Wonke umuntu usho kahle, kodwa kunzima.

Not a permit.	Akuyona imvume.
We'll have to find out more.	Kuzofanele sithole okunye.

No crying.	Akukho ukukhala.
There is danger.	Kukhona ingozi.

You do not think well.	Awucabangi kahle.
He does everything perfectly.	Wenza konke ngokuphelele.
You have to go up.	Kufanele uye phezulu.
We have a lot to do.	Kuningi okumele sikwenze.
You cannot do everything at once.	Awukwazi ukwenza yonke into ngesikhathi esisodwa.
He came in and tried to make himself at home.	Wangena wazama ukuzenza ekhaya.
He didn’t really make time.	Akazange ngempela enze isikhathi.
Maybe for you, he might.	Mhlawumbe ngawe, angase.
He wants to talk to you.	Ufuna ukukhuluma nawe.
That is actually very difficult.	Lokho empeleni kunzima kakhulu.

You should have known.	Kwakufanele wazi.

I hope not to you.	Ngethemba ukuthi akunjalo kuwe.
More on this later.	Okuningi ngalokhu kamuva.
Maybe you want to try something else.	Mhlawumbe ufuna ukuzama enye into.
I've been afraid to tell you anything about what happened.	Ngike ngesaba ukutshela lutho ngokwenzekile.
If so.	Uma kunjalo .
Anyone but him.	Noma ubani ngaphandle kwakhe.
I go to work.	Ngiya emsebenzini.
And he did not know whether he had done the right thing.	Futhi wayengazi ukuthi wenze into efanele yini.
I thought maybe.	Ngacabanga ukuthi mhlawumbe.
He could not sleep last night.	Akakwazanga ukulala izolo ebusuku.
He wanted to go, now.	Wayefuna ukuhamba, manje.
No answer would be enough answer.	Ayikho impendulo ngabe impendulo ngokwanele.
This work will eventually be helpful.	Lo msebenzi ekugcineni uzoba usizo.
You about that.	Wena ngalokho.

And it is very good that it should be so.	Futhi kuhle kakhulu ukuthi kufanele kube njalo.
This, however, by the way.	Lokhu, noma kunjalo, ngendlela.
And that was supposed to be that.	Futhi lokho bekufanele kube yilokho.
Now she is beautiful.	Manje muhle.
He did not want to go back to bed like that.	Wayengafuni ukubuyela embhedeni enjalo.
He certainly is.	Impela ukhona.
Before you leave.	Ngaphambi kokuthi uhambe .
Mother at home.	Umama ekhaya.
But he was not alone.	Kodwa kwakungeyena yedwa.
Everyone says so.	Wonke umuntu usho njalo.

He is a very nice person.	Ungumuntu omuhle kakhulu.
You can do it all at once.	Ungakwenza konke ngesikhathi esisodwa.

Or you try.	Noma uzama.
Or maybe he can.	Noma mhlawumbe angakwazi.
I never thought so.	Angizange ngicabange kanjalo.
But you can't imagine such a thing.	Kodwa awukwazi ukucabanga into enjalo.
He really is a great man.	Ngempela uyindoda enkulu.
He refused to go to the hospital.	Wenqaba ukuya esibhedlela.
It will take a while.	Kuzothatha isikhashana.
He picked up the phone and started talking.	Wathatha ucingo waqala ukukhuluma.
But he did not try hard.	Kodwa akazange azame kanzima.
Just tell me.	Ngitshele nje.
That starts in the right place.	Lokho kuqala endaweni efanele.
That is hardly a story here.	Lokho akuyona neze indaba lapha.
There is no one on earth.	Akekho umuntu emhlabeni.
But it sounds like you know that.	Kodwa kuzwakala sengathi uyakwazi lokho.
This means nothing.	Lokhu akusho lutho.
He did not want everyone to know who he was.	Wayengafuni ukuthi wonke umuntu azi ngaye.
But for now he is the right man.	Kodwa okwamanje uyindoda efanele.
The dog is out.	Inja nje.
Someone better do something soon.	Umuntu ongcono enze okuthile maduze.
Good for him.	Kuhle kuye.
He is very much like you.	Ufana nawe kakhulu.

Not bad reading.	Hhayi ukufunda kabi.
In my house.	Endlini yami.

He came to me immediately.	Weza kimi ngokushesha.
What a great mistake.	Yeka iphutha elikhulu.
It can be difficult at times.	Kungase kube nzima ngezinye izikhathi.
It's the right thing to do.	Yinto efanele.
But this is very good.	Kodwa lokhu kuhle kakhulu.

The boy surprised everyone.	Umfana wamangala wonke umuntu.

You read quickly.	Ufunda ngokushesha.
This is bad news.	Indaba embi le.
Now he would not know why.	Manje wayengeke azi ukuthi kungani.
You should simplify where possible.	Kufanele wenze lula lapho kungenzeka khona.
I wanted it to happen.	Bengifuna ukuthi kwenzeke.
Now we do it all together.	Manje senza konke ndawonye.
Tell me the whole story.	Ngitshele yonke indaba.
You made a really bad choice.	Wenze ukukhetha okubi ngempela.
Or a plan.	Noma icebo.
So yeah, that's fine.	Ngakho yebo, lokho kulungile.
Very good !.	Kuhle kakhulu!.
More waiting.	Ukulinda okuningi.

What a place this is.	Yeka indawo lena.
Thank you, thank you, thank you !.	Ngiyabonga, ngiyabonga, ngiyabonga!.
Please, this way.	Ngicela, ngale ndlela.
Soon he could not.	Ngokushesha akakwazanga.
I think that's my opinion.	Ngicabanga ukuthi umbono wami.
But his spirit.	Kodwa umoya wakhe.
He made his way to the classroom.	Wangena indlela eya ekilasini.
I'll go, if you want me to go.	Ngizohamba, uma ufuna ngihambe.
Not me but.	Hhayi mina kodwa.
I want to be here.	Ngifuna ukuba lapha.
That morning, he told me.	Ngalokho ekuseni, wangitshela.

And do it again.	Futhi ukwenze futhi.

He had to stay.	Kwadingeka ahlale.
He can fix anything.	Angakwazi ukulungisa noma yini.
Nothing more was needed.	Akukho okukhulu kunalokho okwakudingeka.
That will happen, that will definitely happen.	Lokho kuzokwenzeka, lokho kuzokwenzeka nakanjani.
You eat almost anything.	Udla cishe noma yini.
Only it did not really happen.	Kuphela akuzange kwenzeke ngempela.
Everyone talked about it, but no one did anything.	Wonke umuntu wakhuluma ngakho, kodwa akekho owenza lutho.
He wants to retire next year.	Ufuna ukuthatha umhlalaphansi ngonyaka ozayo.
Easily.	Kalula.
Not that he will do it but still.	Hhayi ukuthi uzokwenza kodwa namanje.

Or make music.	Noma wenze umculo.

But, it would be a mistake.	Kodwa, kungaba iphutha.
Only one of you, you know.	Okunye kwakho kuphela, uyazi.
It's just not there.	Ayikho nje lapho.
My father died young.	Ubaba washona esemncane.
You feel like.	Uzizwa sengathi.

But here, there is none.	Kodwa lapha, akukho.
I could not make a bad impression.	Angikwazanga ukwenza umbono omubi.
You got this.	Uthole lokhu.
Just a little.	Kancane nje.
This he would never do.	Lokhu wayengeke neze akwenze.
This is your problem.	Lena inkinga yakho.
He knows nothing, it seems.	Akazi lutho, kubonakala.
But it can actually be.	Kodwa empeleni kungaba.

To help.	Ukuze ngisize.
But we should not go now.	Kodwa akufanele sihambe manje.
But all we have to do is try.	Kodwa okufanele sikwenze ukuzama.
He looked reluctant to speak.	Wayebukeka engafuni ukukhuluma.
Sometimes it seems like it happened yesterday.	Ngezinye izikhathi kubonakala sengathi kwenzeke izolo.
He was obviously surprised by what happened.	Wamangala ngokusobala ngokwenzekile.
I did not want to see anyone.	Ngangingafuni ukubona muntu.
But he could not restrain himself.	Kodwa akakwazanga ukuzibamba.
I would like to know what happened.	Ngingathanda ukwazi ukuthi kwenzakalani.

Maybe he should have it.	Mhlawumbe kufanele abe nakho.
You have been so good!	Ube muhle kakhulu!
That's the way it is today.	Kunjalo namuhla.
In his house but not in his bed.	Endlini yakhe kodwa hhayi embhedeni wakhe.
He heard a noise and started walking faster.	Wezwa umsindo waqala ukuhamba ngokushesha.
This has been great.	Lokhu kube kuhle.
Indeed, he is.	Ngempela, ukhona.
I must not do this.	Akumele ngenze lokhu.

I want to know everything about him.	Ngifuna ukwazi konke ngaye.
Don't just do it.	Ungakwenzi nje.
Not for us, though.	Hhayi kithi, noma kunjalo.
It could be something else.	Kungaba okunye.
I've been making a mistake.	Kade ngenza iphutha.
Not in a good or bad way.	Hhayi ngendlela enhle noma embi.
There is one thing missing.	Kunento eyodwa engekho.
I ask someone to do that.	Ngicela othile akwenze lokho.
Not you either.	Hhayi nawe futhi.
You will need to do this alone.	Lokhu uzodinga ukukwenza uwedwa.
He said.	Uthe .
Fast enough.	Ngokushesha ngokwanele.
My son.	Indodana yami.
You can't, it can't.	Awukwazi, ayikho.
You can do this easily.	Ungakwenza lokhu kalula nje.
I do not like.	Angithandi.
The bigger the better.	Okukhulu kungcono.
There is not much more down here now.	Akukho okunye okuningi lapha phansi manje.
Sometimes very little.	Ngezinye izikhathi kancane kakhulu.
I should not have let it happen.	Kwakungafanele ngivumele kwenzeke.
He can't walk well.	Akakwazi ukuhamba kahle.
He is obviously just sitting.	Kusobala uhlezi nje.
I wanted to get home to him.	Bengifuna ukufika ekhaya kuye.
Not up, not down.	Cha phezulu, akukho phansi.
I could not find a job.	Bengingeke ngikwazi ukuthola umsebenzi.
That's why you live in the city.	Yingakho uhlala edolobheni.
In his house.	Endlini yakhe .
He works hard every day.	Usebenza kanzima nsuku zonke.
He came and sat next to me.	Wafika wahlala eduze kwami.
I don't know why, it's just that.	Angazi ukuthi kungani, kunjalo nje.
That will not happen here.	Lokho ngeke kwenzeke lapha.
I had no idea there was such a thing.	Ngangingazi ukuthi kukhona into enjalo.
Eat lunch alone.	Udle yedwa isidlo sasemini.
He will be doing many things today.	Uzobe enza izinto eziningi namuhla.
He thought he knew.	Wayecabanga ukuthi uyazi.
At least that's what it should be.	Okungenani yilokho okufanele kube ngakho.
Where is this place?	Iyiphi indawo le?
Too many problems.	Izinkinga eziningi kakhulu.
There is no other way.	Ayikho enye indlela.
If he had agreed, he would not have left.	Ukube wavuma, ngabe akazange ahambe.
Your departure should have been fine.	Ukuhamba kwakho bekufanele kube kuhle.
He certainly knew that was not true.	Impela wayazi ukuthi akulona iqiniso lelo.
Yes, it is possible.	Yebo, kungenzeka ngokuphelele.
Something that people do.	Okuthile okwenziwa abantu.
That's a lot.	Kuningi lokho.
Wait a minute.	Ngilinde kancane.
But it is very difficult for me.	Kodwa kunzima kakhulu kimi.
Or at least, it should be.	Noma okungenani, kufanele kube.
I hope that's okay.	Ngethemba ukuthi lokho kulungile.
Eventually, she agreed to marry him.	Ekugcineni, wavuma ukushada naye.
All of that is perfectly fine.	Konke lokho kulungile ngokuphelele.
I don't think so.	angicabangi kahle.
I want to know what happened there.	Ngifuna ukwazi ukuthi kwenzekani lapho.
Now, she is worried.	Manje, ukhathazekile.
You can do this.	Lokhu ungakwenza.
You do not have to do everything yourself.	Akumele wenze yonke into uwedwa.
Certainly nothing is happening.	Impela akukho okwenzekayo.
Nothing and all at once.	Akukho lutho futhi konke ngesikhathi esisodwa.
Obviously he is not human.	Ngokusobala akayena umuntu.
One is obviously a really bad job.	Omunye ngokusobala umsebenzi omubi ngempela.
In fact, you are wrong.	Empeleni, unephutha.
You would not know anyone here.	Ubungazi muntu lapha.
But it is not a concept or something like that.	Kodwa akuwona umqondo noma into enjalo.
Getting there, but not there yet.	Ukufika lapho, kodwa hhayi lapho okwamanje.
Sounds like it sounds to me.	Kuzwakala ukuthi kuzwakala kanjani kimi.
If you have time.	Uma unesikhathi.
Once a week is good.	Kanye ngesonto kuhle.
That was thirty years ago.	Lokho kwenzeka eminyakeni engamashumi amathathu edlule.
He saw now that he did not know what to do with it.	Wabona manje ukuthi akazi enzeni ngakho.
Great story.	Indaba enkulu.
We can't walk.	Asikwazi ukuhamba.
You can't talk to him.	Awukwazi ukukhuluma naye.

He started driving.	Waqala ukushayela.
I feel pain.	Ngizwa ubuhlungu.
Good to see you.	Kuhle ukukubona.

It doesn't have to be this way.	Akumele kube njalo.
I just know you're coming here.	Ngiyazi nje ukuthi uyeza lapha.
There is no one in the car.	Akekho umuntu emotweni.
The wind.	Umoya.
In this case, everything is fine.	Kulokhu, konke kulungile.
I should have made a mistake.	Bekumele ngenze iphutha.
I didn't know much about it but I knew there was no such thing.	Ngangingazi okuningi ngayo kodwa ngazi ukuthi ayikho into enjalo.
There is no choice.	Akukho ukukhetha.
I just want you to think about this too.	Ngifuna nje ucabange ngalokhu nami.

He had to stay in the hospital for a few weeks.	Kwadingeka ahlale esibhedlela amasonto ambalwa.
Everything that happens is true.	Konke okwenzekayo kuyiqiniso.

This is not the time right now.	Njengamanje akusona isikhathi.
Please think about that.	Ngicela ucabange ngalokho.

You will not have to do this alone.	Ngeke kudingeke wenze lokhu uwedwa.
But it will happen.	Kodwa kuzokwenzeka.
A new life, perhaps.	Impilo entsha, mhlawumbe.
Because so it is now.	Ngoba kunjalo manje.
This is for you first.	Lokhu kuwe kuqala.
Or my mother.	Noma umama wami.
Not well, maybe.	Hhayi kahle, mhlawumbe.
He went with that.	Wahamba nalokho.
He said he would like that better.	Wathi angathanda lokho kangcono.
So he finally left.	Ngakho ekugcineni wahamba.
About three.	Cishe ezintathu.
I thought it might be so.	Ngacabanga ukuthi kungase kube njalo.
He says even with him.	Uthi ngisho naye.
I need to do this.	Ngidinga ukwenza lokhu.
But this time.	Kodwa kulokhu.
Once and maybe.	Kanye futhi mhlawumbe.
He wanted to know the time.	Wayefuna ukwazi isikhathi.
Something, at least.	Okuthile, okungenani.
To know that you are here.	Ukuze wazi ukuthi ulapha.

In the morning he said.	Ekuseni uthe.

No, it is not, but it sounds like it.	Cha, akunjalo, kodwa kuzwakala kunjalo.

That seems obvious to me.	Lokho kubonakala kusobala kimi.
All you have to do is say yes.	Okufanele ukwenze ukuthi yebo.
Easily there now.	Kalula lapho manje.
I'm not so sure about that.	Angiqiniseki kangako ngalokho.

For you.	Kwakho.
How much.	Malini.
It works well.	Usebenza kahle.
I just need someone here for me.	Ngidinga umuntu nje lapha kimi.
Too small of that.	Encane kakhulu kulokho.
I want to know.	Ngifuna ukwazi.
So it seems.	Ngakho kubonakala.
No one else in the station should know anything.	Akekho omunye esiteshini okufanele azi lutho.
If you are sure.	Uma uqinisekile.
He is afraid of everything.	Wesaba yonke into.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa akunjalo ngempela.
He refused one.	Wenqaba eyodwa.
I thought.	Ngangicabanga.
But he knew he wouldn't.	Kodwa wayazi ukuthi wayengeke.
He asked me to stay in the restaurant.	Wangicela ukuthi ngihlale endlini yokudlela.
I realized my mistake.	Ngabona iphutha lami.
Not so in this case.	Akunjalo kulokhu.
I tried everything there.	Ngazama konke lapho.
So, finally.	Ngakho, ekugcineni.
Unless it is true.	Ngaphandle kokuthi kuyiqiniso.
That much is true.	Lokho okuningi kuyiqiniso.
It may be later today.	Kungase kube kamuva namuhla.
He should have known better.	Bekufanele azi kangcono.
You will not save any.	Ngeke ugcine noma iyiphi.
There is so much more for us.	Kuningi okwengeziwe kithi.

Everyone should eat.	Wonke umuntu kufanele adle.
If you think you will get better, you will get better.	Uma ucabanga ukuthi uzoba ngcono, uzoba ngcono.
He only knew he had to try.	Wayazi kuphela ukuthi kufanele azame.
Tell me why you want it.	Ngitshele ukuthi kungani ufuna.
Time.	Isikhathi.
He has great potential.	Unekhono elihle.
Dad can be helpful.	Ubaba angaba usizo.
It will not be me.	Ngeke kube yimina.
It will not be days.	Ngeke kube izinsuku.
But there is a place.	Kodwa kukhona indawo.
So let's do it.	Ngakho ake sikwenze.
But not so much.	Kodwa hhayi kakhulu.
This is not a good thing, this should never happen.	Lokhu akuyona into enhle, akufanele neze kwenzeke lokhu.
Only his eyes.	Amehlo akhe kuphela.
Saying 'thank you', maybe.	Ukuthi 'ngiyabonga', mhlawumbe.
He does not know what he wants to do.	Akazi ukuthi ufuna ukwenzani.
Not so much.	Hhayi kakhulu.
He died young.	Washona esemncane.
He saw.	Wabona.
He did many things for me.	Wenza izinto eziningi kimi.
It is not too late.	Hhayi sekwephuzile lokhu.
We do our best.	Senza okusemandleni.
That was this week.	Lokho kube kuleli sonto.
The police must tell the family.	Amaphoyisa kumele atshele umndeni.
Here are some of the ones.	Lezi ezinye izinto.
She said she feels much better.	Wathi uzizwa engcono kakhulu.
He did this for several weeks.	Lokhu wakwenza amasonto ambalwa.
That is almost always the case.	Cishe yilokho okwenzeka njalo.
I want to learn more about it.	Ngifuna ukufunda okwengeziwe ngayo.
It might, a little.	Kungase, kancane.
You are not one of us.	Awuyena omunye wethu.
I had to do more.	Bekufanele ngenze okwengeziwe.
Not at this time.	Hhayi ngalesi sikhathi.
So now we know.	Ngakho manje siyazi.
I hear a noise, but nothing else.	Ngizwa umsindo, kodwa akukho okunye.
I feel very happy here.	Ngizizwa ngijabule kakhulu lapha.
And again, not what happened.	Futhi futhi, hhayi okwenzekile.
Tell me about yourself.	Ungitshele ngawe.
And it will not be easy.	Futhi ngeke kube lula.
Everything seems fine to me.	Konke kubonakala kulungile kimi.
Everything seems fine.	Konke kubonakala kulungile.
Really, really good.	Ngempela, kahle ngempela.
This is our place.	Lena indawo yethu.
That's absolutely fine.	Lokho kuhle ngokuphelele.
It never happened to me.	Akuzange kwenzeke kimi.
That will not be necessary.	Lokho angeke kudingeke.
But to me it seems he is doing well so far.	Kodwa kimi kubonakala sengathi wenza kahle kuze kube manje.
Fresh air, really.	Umoya omusha, ngempela.
My opinion is that it will be so.	Umbono wami ukuthi kuzoba njalo.
I do not know how that is possible.	Angazi ukuthi lokho kungenzeka kanjani.
I hope you will too.	Ngethemba ukuthi nawe uzokwenza.
He did not really know how long.	Wayengazi ngempela ukuthi kuze kube nini.
Of course that is not entirely true.	Yebo lokho akulona iqiniso ngokuphelele.
I'm waiting for you.	Ngilinde wena.
The sound seems to work well.	Umsindo ubonakala usebenza kahle.
You told me that story.	Ungitshele leyo ndaba.
This is not our problem.	Akuyona inkinga yethu lena.
You would be making a big mistake.	Uzobe wenza iphutha elikhulu.
I would like better.	Ngingathanda kangcono.
But everyone wanted to make that a problem.	Kodwa wonke umuntu wayefuna ukwenza lokho kube inkinga.
You will definitely be there again.	Nakanjani uzohlala lapho futhi.
Now help me here.	Manje ngisize lapha.
Who.	Ubani.
There is only one.	Kukhona eyodwa kuphela.
Why go when you can't ride?	Kungani uhamba uma ungakwazi ukugibela?
If you are happy where you are, it is good for you.	Uma ujabule lapho ukhona, kuhle kuwe.
I have never been home.	Angikaze ngifike ekhaya.
But at first he did not want to drink.	Kodwa yena ekuqaleni wayengafuni ukuphuza.
There is nothing there, either.	Akukho lutho lapho, futhi.
You will need that.	Uzodinga lokho.
Why he did that.	Kungani enza kanjalo.
Said the boy.	Wathi umfana.
Everyone said he did.	Wonke umuntu wathi yena.
Why not do that now.	Kungani ungakwenzi lokho manje.
He never said that.	Akakaze akhulume kanjalo.
He wants to know how.	Ufuna ukwazi ukuthi kanjani.
And now is the time.	Futhi manje isikhathi.
And he didn't want to be.	Futhi wayengafuni ukuba.
The work began just once.	Umsebenzi waqala kanye nje.
I'm waiting in the car.	Ngilinde emotweni.
At least for me.	Okungenani ngami.
He walked slowly into the house.	Wahamba kancane endlini.
He took three.	Wathatha ezintathu.
I realized that something was amiss.	Ngabona ukuthi kukhona okukhulu.
This did not happen.	Lokhu akuzange kube njalo.
You need the ball on the ground.	Udinga ibhola phansi.
No more will be needed.	Ngeke kudingeke okwengeziwe.
I have never told you before.	Angizange ngikutshele ngaphambili.
And nothing else.	Futhi akukho okunye.
Obviously, that should be the case.	Ngokusobala, kufanele kube njalo.
And thank you !!.	Futhi ngiyabonga!!.
She is actually really beautiful.	Empeleni muhle ngempela.
It's up to you.	Kube ngawe.
So tell me the truth.	Ngakho ngitshele iqiniso.
I would like to go home.	Ngingathanda ukubuyela ekhaya.
I’m not sure if it’s a very good idea or not.	Angiqiniseki ukuthi umqondo omuhle kakhulu noma cha.
I would probably.	Ngingathanda mhlawumbe.
Let me tell you something.	Ake ngikutshele okuthile.
You just know.	Uyazi nje.
To go the right way.	Ukuze uhambe ngendlela efanele.
As soon as possible.	Ngokushesha ngangokunokwenzeka.
That's me.	Yimi lowo.
What to do.	Okufanele ngikwenze.
I know you can do it.	Ngiyazi ungakwenza.
I'm not sure what the best way to do it.	Angiqiniseki ukuthi iyiphi indlela engcono kakhulu yokwenza ngakho.
Just a boy.	Umfana nje.
First you.	Okokuqala wena.
I did something wrong.	Ngenza into embi.
And not a bit.	Futhi hhayi kancane.
Very good question.	Umbuzo omuhle kakhulu.
You just look so bad, right now.	Ubukeka kabi nje, njengamanje.
But that is not a good thing.	Kodwa akulona iqiniso elihle.
He looked really bad.	Wayebukeka kabi ngempela.
This is new.	Lena entsha.
But we need to do something to fix this quickly.	Kodwa sidinga ukwenza okuthile ukulungisa lokhu ngokushesha.
It does not say another boy.	Akusho omunye umfana.
Kade.	Kade.
I found this easily.	Ngithole lokhu kalula.
It needs to be good enough.	Kudingeka kube kuhle ngokwanele.
Not a very good thing.	Akuyona into enhle kakhulu.
He came right there.	Weza khona lapho.
In fact, he did not.	Empeleni, akazange.
So that starts.	Ngakho lokho kuqala.
This he did, however.	Lokhu kodwa wakwenza.
I hope you do not need to come here.	Ngethemba ukuthi awudingi ukuza lapha.
But how? 	Kodwa kanjani?
He really did not know.	Ngempela wayengazi.
I don't want to eat anything yet.	Angifuni ukudla lutho okwamanje.
He said.	Uthe.
That sounds right.	Lokho kuzwakala kulungile.
But I hope not again.	Kodwa ngethemba ukuthi ngeke futhi.
He plays the piano very well.	Udlala upiyano kahle kakhulu.
You know better.	Wazi kangcono.
But I'm not sure.	Kodwa angiqiniseki.
The reason would not be good.	Isizathu ngeke kube kuhle lokho.
But not too many.	Kodwa hhayi abaningi kakhulu.
He is here right now.	Ukhona njengamanje.
It's not really a thing.	Akuyona into ngempela.
He will go home soon.	Uzoya ekhaya maduze.
I need to think.	Ngidinga ukucabanga.
We need a ride.	Sidinga ukugibela.
Not so much, not even that.	Hhayi kangako, ngisho nalokho.
Being here now.	Ukuba lapha manje.
The food is really good.	Ukudla kuhle ngempela.
Are you sleeping well tonight?	Ulele kahle namuhla ebusuku?
You want a baby.	Ufuna ingane.
So how to do it.	Ngakho kanjani ukwenza.
This is better.	Lokhu kungcono.
You read this correctly.	Ufunda lokhu ngendlela efanele.
As you go.	Njengoba uhamba.
Not in this country, at least.	Hhayi kuleli, okungenani.
That would be a good thing to do.	Lokho kungaba yinto enhle ukuyenza.
He said help me, help me.	Wathi ngisize, ngisize.
He is not at home.	Akekho ekhaya.
Not in his room.	Akukho ekamelweni lakhe.
You received a message.	Uthole umlayezo.
But let me tell you something.	Kodwa ake ngikutshele okuthile.
It can be a program.	Kungaba uhlelo.
I do not know how this happened.	Angazi ukuthi kwenzeka kanjani lokhu.
It's hard to be high.	Kunzima ukuba phezulu.
I felt there was a problem coming.	Ngezwa ukuthi kukhona inkinga ezayo.
I have to be there.	Kufanele ngibe lapho.
But how to do that.	Kodwa ukwenza kanjani lokho.
More than that happened.	Okuningi kunalokho okwenzeka.
Yes, she is very beautiful.	Yebo, muhle kakhulu.
He never was.	Akazange abe njalo.
I asked his name.	Ngabuza igama lakhe.
I think he left because he wanted to go.	Ngicabanga ukuthi uhambe ngoba efuna ukuhamba.
And that's fine, really.	Futhi lokho kuhle, empeleni.
He can't go on.	Akakwazi ukuqhubeka.
Or even dinner.	Noma ngisho isidlo sakusihlwa.
He declined to comment.	Wenqaba ukukhuluma ngokwenzekile.
Still, a good idea.	Noma kunjalo, umqondo omuhle.
I need more.	Ngidinga okwengeziwe.
He knows his job here.	Uyazi ukuthi umsebenzi wakhe lapha.
Your biggest mistake.	Iphutha lakho elikhulu.
First out.	Okokuqala ukuphuma.
And it is not the time when it happened.	Futhi akusona isikhathi lapho kwenzeka.
Not that sounds hard.	Hhayi ukuthi kuzwakala kunzima.
He would love to stay here again.	Angathanda ukuhlala lapha futhi.
All the way.	Indlela yonke.
That's what friends do.	Yilokho okwenziwa abangane.
If you've been here, you know.	Uma uke waba lapha, uyazi.
We should all do better.	Sonke kufanele senze kangcono.
I have never heard of you.	Angikaze ngizwe ngawe.
Now this is the problem.	Manje lena inkinga.
I hope this is the case.	Ngethemba ukuthi lokhu kunjalo.
Well, that's all.	Kulungile, yilokho kuphela.
I mean anything.	Ngisho noma yini.
Of course, that should not be the case.	Yebo, akufanele kube njalo.
At least, a little.	Okungenani, kancane.
Okay, so that's not a name at all.	Kulungile, ngakho akulona igama nhlobo.
He's a good boy.	Ungumfana omuhle.
True.	Iqiniso.
And now he wants to go home.	Futhi manje ufuna ukuya ekhaya.
I wanted to get back to town immediately.	Ngangifuna ukubuyela edolobheni ngokushesha.
I don't think this is true.	Angicabangi ukuthi lokhu kuyiqiniso.
We have to go to work tomorrow.	Kuzomele siye emsebenzini kusasa.
Why on earth is it so difficult.	Kungani emhlabeni kunzima kangaka.
But some are not.	Kodwa okunye akukho.
No, it's not there.	Cha, akukho lapho.
I think he is.	Ngicabanga ukuthi nguye.
This could be months or years.	Lokhu kungaba izinyanga noma iminyaka.
Obviously, there is a big but.	Ngokusobala, kukhona omkhulu kodwa.
First, you work hard all the time.	Okokuqala, usebenza kanzima ngaso sonke isikhathi.
He speaks very quickly.	Ukhuluma ngokushesha kakhulu.
He knew it was going to happen.	Wayazi ukuthi kuzokwenzeka.
The idea is here.	Umbono ulapha.
He started saying something.	Waqala ukusho okuthile.
I am very happy with him.	Ngijabule kakhulu naye.
It should be very easy to get to.	Kufanele kube lula kakhulu ukufika.
He just wouldn't.	Wayengeke nje.
I don't want to do it here.	Angifuni ukukwenza lapha.
Please go here.	Ngicela uhambe lapha.
And thank you.	Futhi ngiyabonga.
Not one time.	Hhayi nesikhathi esisodwa.
Any way to do this ?.	Noma iyiphi indlela yokwenza lokhu?.
By work, anything.	Ngomsebenzi, noma yini.
I will be here no matter what.	Ngizoba lapha noma ngabe kwenzeka.
It happened last week.	Kwenzeke ngesonto eledlule.
I would like to talk to you today if you are available.	Ngingathanda ukukhuluma nawe namuhla uma ukhona.
Faster, and more.	Ngokushesha, futhi okuningi.
I am happy now.	Ngijabule manje.
He said he knew nothing about it.	Wathi akazi lutho ngakho.
We want to do the right thing.	Sifuna ukwenza okufanele.
That might be okay.	Lokho kungase kube kulungile.
I waited for him to say something.	Ngilinde ukuthi akhulume okuthile.
He knows nothing about this.	Akwazi lutho ngalokhu.
At least not yet.	Okungenani hhayi kuze kube manje.
In this case, he was not sure.	Kulokhu, wayengenaso isiqiniseko.
Or absent.	Noma engekho.
But at night.	Kodwa ebusuku.
The family went to the door. 	Umndeni waya emnyango. 
You may have been there for a long time.	Kungenzeka ube khona isikhathi eside.
Because there is someone else.	Ngoba kukhona omunye.
I'm afraid he might.	Ngesaba ukuthi angase.
Just one place.	Indawo eyodwa nje.
I really wouldn’t do that anyway.	Bengingeke ngempela ngikwenze kunjalo.
Only another danger.	Kuphela enye ingozi.
Unless we need your help.	Ngaphandle kokuthi sidinga usizo lwakho.
A few years ago.	Eminyakeni embalwa edlule.
I can't continue right now.	Angikwazi ukuqhubeka njengamanje.
I do not really understand.	Angiqondi ngempela.
And it's just fine.	Futhi kuhle nje.
In this.	Kulokhu.
But he could not say that now.	Kodwa wayengeke akwazi ukusho lokho manje.
Everyone wanted it to be that way.	Wonke umuntu wayefuna kube njalo.
Occasionally.	Okwenzeka njalo nje.
But it is not a job.	Kodwa akuwona umsebenzi.
I want him back with us.	Ngifuna abuye nathi.
That is the way life should be.	Kumelwe kube njalo ukuphila.
Not just you and me.	Hhayi mina nawe kuphela.
You will get there.	Uzofika kukho.
He knows better than that.	Wazi kangcono kunalokho.
So it happened.	Ngakho kwenzeka lokho.
That would be really nice.	Lokho kungaba kuhle ngempela.
All your performance should be good.	Konke ukwenza kwakho kufanele kube kuhle.
That's all good.	Konke lokho kuhle.
You do not think.	Awucabangi.
I think you did too.	Ngicabanga ukuthi nawe wenze kanjalo.
A little something for me.	Into encane kimi.
I wanted that.	Ngangifuna lokho.
He, the group.	Yena, iqembu.
Or he did.	Noma wenza kanjalo.
So much more.	Okuningi okuningi.
Not so, though.	Akunjalo, noma kunjalo.
I can't get into that.	Angikwazi ukungena kulokho.
He started very quickly.	Waqala ngokushesha okukhulu.
Very good for me.	Kuhle kakhulu kimi.
And that should not be.	Futhi lokho akufanele.
That did not happen.	Lokho akuzange kube njalo.
He requested a meeting.	Wacela umhlangano.
Or he will return.	Noma uzobuya.
That's the idea.	Yilokho umbono.
She started singing.	Waqala ukucula.
Nothing but friends.	Lutho kodwa abangani.
Exactly.	Kanye kanye.
I'm trying to read again.	Ngizama ukufunda futhi.
Alone.	Eyedwa.
It could be going to college.	Kungaba ukuya ekolishi.
You never knew.	Awuzange wazi.
Until he.	Kuze yena.
Yes, yes, yes.	Yebo, yebo, yebo.
He immediately asked for food.	Ngokushesha wacela ukudla.
Now with that said.	Manje ngalokho okushiwo.
But if he does.	Kodwa uma enza.
He asked me.	Wangibuza.
Not because of me.	Hhayi ngenxa yami.
Always.	Njalo.
He never thought.	Wayengacabangi neze.
Why, he wasn't sure.	Ngani, wayengenaso isiqiniseko.
I have been away for a very long time.	Ngihambe isikhathi eside kakhulu.
He does so now.	Wenza kanjalo manje.
we can't walk.	asikwazi ukuhamba.
Sometimes a few hours.	Ngezinye izikhathi amahora ambalwa.
He is a great man.	Ungumuntu omkhulu.
That's probably okay for now.	Lokho cishe kulungile okwamanje.
You and I both know that this is not the case.	Mina nawe sobabili siyazi ukuthi akunjalo.
But then another came out.	Kodwa omunye waphuma.
Just my name.	Igama lami nje.
Or why.	Noma kungani.
Never again.	Ngeke ngiphinde.
But in reality, that is not a job at all.	Kodwa empeleni, lokho akuwona neze umsebenzi.
He is.	Nguye.
She says she is happy.	Uthi ujabule.
Not much, really.	Hhayi okuningi, ngempela.
She's just trying to be beautiful.	Uzama nje ukuba muhle.
I wanted to talk more.	Ngangifuna ukukhuluma okwengeziwe.
He was not entirely sure.	Wayengenaso isiqiniseko ngokuphelele.
If you want to be.	Uma ufuna ukuba.
But he must be alone.	Kodwa kumele abe yedwa.
It is not small if.	Akuyona encane uma.
He said he just wanted to talk.	Wathi ufuna ukukhuluma nje.
And it is not just death.	Futhi akukhona nje ukufa.
He never told me who he was.	Akazange angitshele ukuthi ubani.
A small child.	Ingane encane.
We did it on time.	Senze ngesikhathi.
I hope he doesn't leave.	Ngethemba ukuthi ngeke ahambe.
He said he did his best.	Wathi wenza konke okusemandleni akhe.
I also had to think about it.	Nami bekumele ngicabange ngakho.
But it's my truth, that's right.	Kodwa kuyiqiniso lami, kunjalo.
I never was, not.	Angikaze ngibe, akunjalo.
I think that's a good thing.	Ngicabanga ukuthi yinto enhle leyo.
Everyone knows that too.	Wonke umuntu uyazi ukuthi kakhulu.
And that's not a bad thing.	Futhi lokho akuyona into embi.
There is so much to do.	Kuningi okumele akwenze.
I have found my truth.	Ngithole iqiniso lami.
He also heard a noise.	Wezwa futhi umsindo.
He left the house immediately.	Waphuma endlini ngokushesha.
We want everyone to go away very happy.	Sifuna wonke umuntu ahambe ejabule kakhulu.
I'd better go with you.	Kungcono ngihambe nawe.
I know how you feel now.	Ngiyazi ukuthi uzizwa kanjani manje.
But not a car.	Kodwa hhayi imoto.
There is really nothing more to this.	Akukho okunye ngempela kulokhu.
And he is here with us.	Futhi ulapha nathi.
And there is another place.	Futhi kukhona enye indawo.

He did not really want to go there.	Wayengafuni ngempela ukuya lapho.
But you do not have to be.	Kodwa akudingekile ukuba ube.
In the end it was not done.	Ekugcineni akuzange kwenziwe.
Anyway, that's me.	Noma kunjalo, lokho kimi.
But big money no.	Kodwa imali enkulu cha.

Something has happened here recently.	Kukhona okwenzekile lapha muva nje.
And take that as a yes.	Futhi ukuthatha lokho njengoba yebo.
It happened last month.	Kwenzeka ngenyanga edlule.
Or we should go.	Noma kufanele sihambe.
A lot more.	Okuningi okwengeziwe.
Or he did not, until last night.	Noma akazange, kuze kube izolo ebusuku.
So you have to tell me what to do.	Ngakho kufanele ungitshele ukuthi ngenzeni.
I think you did a good job.	Ngicabanga ukuthi wenze umsebenzi omuhle.
He did this as quickly as he could.	Lokhu wakwenza ngokushesha njengakuqala.
But he wanted to say one thing.	Kodwa wayefuna ukusho into eyodwa.
All right though.	Kulungile kunjalo.
And he did for a while.	Futhi wenza isikhashana.
I heard your voice.	Ngizwe izwi lakho.
Lots of smoking.	Ukubhema okuningi.
It all starts at the beginning.	Konke kuqala ekuqaleni.
Would you like to go with me?	Ungathanda ukuhamba nami?
Not so much, really.	Hhayi kakhulu, ngempela.
He will have to help us.	Kuzodingeka asisize.
Not the police, not the police.	Hhayi amaphoyisa, hhayi amaphoyisa.
All of us.	Sonke.
I know it can be difficult to come here.	Ngiyazi kungase kube nzima ukuza lapha.
She and him together.	Yena kanye naye ndawonye.
I think so.	Ngicabanga ukuthi .
The meeting will be tomorrow.	Umhlangano uzoba kusasa.
But not everything.	Kodwa hhayi konke.
He wants to retire.	Ufuna ukuthatha umhlalaphansi.
I want to stay.	Ngifuna ukuhlala.
I would like to know that.	Ngingathanda ukwazi lokho.
I just want to say.	Ngifuna ukusho nje.
Or, it seems.	Noma, kubonakala kunjalo.
I would like to speak with him today.	Ngingathanda ukukhuluma naye namuhla.
But, the big question.	Kodwa, umbuzo omkhulu.
He did this.	Lokhu wakwenza.
I would really like to hear from you.	Ngingathanda ngempela ukuzwa kuwe.
I do not want to be alone.	Angifuni ukuba ngedwa.
Yes, that's right.	Yebo, lokho kanye.
He would not do that.	Wayengeke akwenze lokho.
But maybe that's just the way it is.	Kodwa mhlawumbe kunjalo nje.
Then up, up.	Khona phezulu, phezulu.
Not so today.	Akunjalo namuhla.
There is no way to make money.	Ayikho indlela yokwenza imali.
At least that's what he said.	Okungenani yilokho akusho.
And we did not at first.	Futhi asizange ekuqaleni.
He asked questions.	Wabuza imibuzo.
She is so beautiful and makes for an afternoon.	Muhle kakhulu futhi wenza ntambama.
He is not in the background.	Akekho ngemuva.
He said he thought he could.	Wathi wayecabanga ukuthi angakwazi.
This is our story.	Lena indaba yethu.
The right way.	Indlela efanele.
Ride alone.	Ukugibela uwedwa.
Thank you, though.	Ngiyabonga, noma kunjalo.
I don't know who else it could be.	Angazi ukuthi kungaba ubani omunye.
I'm not entirely sure what happened.	Angiqiniseki ngokuphelele ukuthi kwenzekeni.
It may be days, or it may be too long.	Kungase kube izinsuku, noma kungaba isikhathi eside kakhulu.
Let me tell you something.	Ake ngikutshele okunye.
But it could be all.	Kodwa kungaba konke.
I wanted to make sure everything sounded good.	Bengifuna ukwenza isiqiniseko sokuthi konke kuzwakala kahle.
This seems to have happened many years ago.	Lokhu kubonakala kwenzeka eminyakeni eminingi edlule.
I'm not entirely sure.	Angiqiniseki ngokuphelele.
But also life.	Kodwa futhi ukuphila.
He sat down next to her.	Wahlala phansi eduze kwakhe.
To fix this.	Ukulungisa lokhu.
And it shouldn't.	Futhi bekungafanele.
He made it clear to her that he was not.	Wakwenza kwacaca kuye ukuthi akayena.
There is a place everywhere.	Kukhona indawo yonke indawo.
He got into bed and tried to sleep.	Wangena embhedeni wazama ukulala.
But maybe he would have.	Kodwa mhlawumbe wayezoba nakho.
Let me do it this way.	Ake ngenze ngale ndlela.
Is it okay ?.	Ngabe kulungile?.
First here.	Okokuqala lapha.
I'll go with you if you like.	Ngizohamba nawe uma uthanda.
Probably, it seems, okay.	Kungenzeka, kubonakala, kulungile.
Not so in the morning.	Akunjalo ekuseni.
Good thing, by the way.	Into enhle, ngendlela.
But it can actually be helpful.	Kodwa kungase kube usizo empeleni.
You wouldn't do that now.	Ubungeke ukwenze lokho manje.
At least for a while.	Okungenani isikhashana.
It would be.	Kungase kube.
To be with me.	Ukuba nami.
This is not the case.	Lokhu akulona icala.
Just the wind.	Umoya nje.
It's just that everyone wants to be his friend.	Ukuthi nje wonke umuntu ufuna ukuba umngane wakhe.
I think that now.	Ngicabanga ukuthi manje.
You made a big mistake!	Wenza iphutha elikhulu!
He should not have done this.	Bekungafanele akwenze lokhu.
He wanted to learn more about her.	Wayefuna ukufunda okwengeziwe ngaye.
We all have to go a long way.	Sonke kufanele sihambe kakhulu.
He returned to her.	Wabuyela kuye.
You know nothing about him.	Awazi lutho ngaye.
I never did that.	Angikaze ngikwenze lokho.
That will not be easy.	Lokho ngeke kwenziwe kalula.
When you are better, you are probably playing harder.	Uma ungcono, cishe udlala kanzima.
I have waited too long for this moment.	Ngilinde isikhathi eside kakhulu ngalesi sikhathi.
He is sure of everything.	Uqinisekile ngakho konke.
It should not have happened.	Bekungafanele kwenzeke.
He had to make a decision.	Kwakufanele enze isinqumo.
If you want to, that's right.	Uma ufuna, kunjalo.
Actually, thank you.	Empeleni, ngiyabonga.
I think that's his name.	Ngicabanga ukuthi igama lakhe lelo.
At the top there.	Phezulu kukho.
This is not your chance.	Akulona ithuba lakho.
I wanted to go back to the beginning.	Ngangifuna ukubuyela ekuqaleni.
And you will never know.	Futhi ngeke wazi.
Three in the class.	Ezintathu ekilasini.
Money problem.	Inkinga imali.
This may be the case.	Lokhu kungase kube njalo.
No, not near, not near, not near.	Cha, hhayi eduze, hhayi eduze, hhayi eduze.
He started playing the guitar.	Waqala ukudlala isiginci.
Not much is said.	Akukho okuningi okushiwo.
And it does, sometimes.	Futhi kwenzeka, ngezinye izikhathi.
He is coming well.	Uyeza kahle.
But no, he did not say anything before he left.	Kodwa cha, akazange akhulume lutho ngaphambi kokuba ahambe.
You really need to sleep later.	Ngempela udinga ukulala kamuva.
You want your family.	Ufuna umndeni wakho.
Absolutely.	Ngokuphelele.
He had to come back now.	Bekumele abuye manje.
Probably small.	Mhlawumbe encane.
Right there before.	Khona lapho ngaphambili.
I don't know why, but it's true.	Angazi ukuthi kungani, kodwa kuyiqiniso.
I would like to think that that never happened.	Ngingathanda ukucabanga ukuthi lokho akuzange kwenzeke.
This is not the place.	Akuyona indawo lena.
I came home.	Ngifike ekhaya.
This.	Lokhu.
But he did not know what to do again.	Kodwa wayengazi ukuthi enzeni futhi.
What is that? 	Yini leyo?
That is not true at all.	Lokho akulona iqiniso ngempela.
It had to happen that way.	Kwakufanele kwenzeke kanjalo.
He was visible.	Wayebonakala.
And it is not necessary.	Futhi akudingekile.
It does not have to happen.	Akukhona ukuthi kufanele kwenzeke.
And he is not alone.	Futhi akuyena yedwa.
But please don't do it.	Kodwa ngicela ungakwenzi.
I wanted to make one, too.	Bengifuna ukwenza eyodwa, nami.
And this is exactly what it is.	Futhi lokhu kunjalo impela.
And we made a really good team.	Futhi senze iqembu elihle ngempela.
You don't have to come to school so early.	Akudingekile ukuthi ufike esikoleni ekuseni kangaka.
I may have done something else.	Kungenzeka ukuthi ngenze okunye.
But he gave a lot of money.	Kodwa wanikeza imali eningi.
If you want to talk to us, that's fine.	Uma ufuna ukukhuluma nathi, kulungile.
He asked if he had made a mistake.	Wabuza ukuthi wenze iphutha yini.
Yes you may be wrong.	Yebo kungenzeka ukuthi unephutha.
I said anyway.	Ngathi noma kunjalo.
None of this was required.	Akukho kulokhu okwakudingeka.
He did not become our friend.	Akazange abe umngane wethu.
Very good too.	Kuhle kakhulu futhi.
That was just what was needed.	Lokho nje okwakudingeka.
I just wanted to.	Bengifuna nje.
He should say that to her.	Kufanele asho kanjalo kuye.
But there is more.	Kodwa kukhona okunye futhi.
He used to talk to me about him.	Wayevame ukukhuluma nami ngaye.
As it is, now.	Njengoba kunjalo, manje.
I knew exactly what to do.	Ngangazi kahle ukuthi yini okufanele ngiyenze.
The problem.	Inkinga.
And, anyway.	Futhi, noma kunjalo.
I had to think.	Kwadingeka ngicabange.
You don't want to go either.	Nawe awufuni ukuhamba.
You will not make much money by doing this.	Ngeke wenze imali eningi ngokwenza lokhu.
Not maybe so.	Hhayi mhlawumbe ngakho.
He stared for a long time.	Wabheka isikhathi eside.
He will not return for a few days.	Ngeke abuye izinsuku ezimbalwa.
This is your time.	Isikhathi sakho lesi.
This is just fine.	Lokhu kuhle nje.
We all want to do it.	Sonke sifuna ukukwenza.
No one really.	Akukho muntu ngempela.
It seems.	Kubonakala sengathi.
Like you now.	Njengawe manje.
I do not know either.	Angazi nami.
Not something like that.	Hhayi into enjalo.
I should not do this.	Akufanele ngenze lokhu.
Maybe someone too bad.	Mhlawumbe othile omubi kakhulu.
And it is not an accident.	Futhi akuyona ingozi.
I'll have to do it myself.	Kuzofanele ngikwenze mina.
So, there is no choice.	Ngakho, akukho ukukhetha.
You look like him.	Ufana naye.
He became exactly that many years later.	Waba yilokho kanye eminyakeni eminingi kamuva.
Just let me.	Ngivumele nje.
I think about it a lot.	Ngicabanga ngakho kakhulu.
Or he may not.	Noma angeke.
But here is another story.	Kodwa futhi lena enye indaba.
But it can be a bad thing.	Kodwa kungaba yinto embi.
He can't drive.	Akakwazi ukushayela.
That in the beginning.	Lokho ekuqaleni.
What else do I have to do here.	Yini enye okufanele ngiyenze lapha.
But there is one more thing before you go.	Kodwa kunento eyodwa futhi ngaphambi kokuthi uhambe.
I've never been there.	Angikaze ngiye lapho.
But he thought it might be you.	Kodwa wayecabanga ukuthi kungenzeka ukuthi nguwe.
Of course he could not.	Yebo akakwazanga.
It will take people.	Kuzothatha abantu.
He certainly would not have done that.	Ngempela wayengeke akwenze lokho.
And he told me to leave the world.	Futhi wangitshela ukuthi ngihambe emhlabeni.
I saw why.	Ngabona ukuthi kungani.
It looks good on you.	Kubukeka kahle kuwe.
This is the wrong approach.	Lena indlela engalungile.
He thought so.	Naye wacabanga kanjalo.
But you did not come.	Kodwa awuzange ufike.
We did the job quickly.	Senza umsebenzi ngokushesha.
You know your child well.	Uyazi kahle ingane yakho.
It will be very difficult.	Kuzoba nzima impela.
Such a bad thing.	Into embi kangaka.
You do not need to get into it.	Awudingi ukungena kukho.
You just know what to do.	Uyazi nje okumele ukwenze.
He tried to think of nothing.	Wazama ukucabanga lutho.
He got that from you.	Uthole lokho kuwe.
You need a car.	Udinga imoto.
Do not forget anything.	Ungakhohlwa lutho.
Everyone knows.	Wonke umuntu uyazi.
I think he knew anyway.	Ngicabanga ukuthi wayazi noma kunjalo.
He thought again quickly.	Wacabanga kabusha ngokushesha.
Maybe it has something to do with this.	Mhlawumbe kunento yokwenza nalokhu.
You can't really do that right now.	Awukwazi ngempela ukwenza lokho njengamanje.
I saw the way.	Ngabona indlela.
He plays very well.	Udlala kahle kakhulu.
He knew.	Wayazi.
But not there.	Kodwa hhayi lapho.
No one should know.	Akekho okufanele azi.
If you can talk about it.	Uma ukwazi ukukhuluma ngakho.
Indeed,	Impela,
I said the same thing here.	Ngikhulume into efanayo lapha.
No, it looks like he did, but he didn't.	Cha, kubukeka sengathi wenza, kodwa akazange.
We can't stay.	Asikwazi ukuhlala.
Would you like to go with you?	Ungathanda ukuhamba nawe?
Party.	Iphathi.
Not my job, for me.	Hhayi umsebenzi wami, kimi.
You should be, too.	Kufanele ube, nawe.
I think he is.	Ngicabanga yena.
I hope to see you there.	Ngethemba ukukubona lapho.
I don't want him to leave right now.	Angifuni ahambe okwamanje.
Can you help?	Ungakwazi ukusiza?
I'm not sure why, but it is.	Angiqiniseki ukuthi kungani kunjalo, kodwa kunjalo.
You had better leave right away.	Kungcono uhambe ngaso leso sikhathi.
And you can't do that unless you know who that person is.	Futhi awukwazi ukwenza lokho ngaphandle uma wazi ukuthi ubani lowo muntu.
Looks like anything can happen there.	Kubukeka sengathi kungenzeka noma yini lapho.
I want another chance.	Ngifuna elinye ithuba.
Not years yet.	Hhayi iminyaka okwamanje.
Good voice.	Izwi elihle.
He doesn't think about it.	Akacabangi ngakho.
Or just fine.	Noma kuhle nje.
She is beautiful though.	Muhle noma kunjalo.
This we cannot do.	Lokhu asikwazi ukukwenza.
I'm glad you're here.	Ngiyajabula ukuthi ukhona.
No, you never.	Cha, awukaze.
He can be anyone, anywhere.	Angaba noma ubani, noma kuphi.
He is like us.	Ufana nathi.
All thanks.	Konke ngiyabonga.
No one wants the truth.	Akekho ofuna iqiniso.
Tell people what you did.	Tshela abantu ukuthi wenzeni.
He was optimistic.	Wayenethemba.
I should be able to do this.	Kufanele ngikwazi ukwenza lokhu.
You do not need to think again.	Awudingi ukucabanga futhi.
Boy in bed.	Umfana embhedeni.
But he knew.	Kodwa wayazi.
He started drinking.	Waqala ukuphuza.
But he could not see the picture.	Kodwa akakwazanga ukubona isithombe.
And you should be.	Futhi kufanele ube.
Definitely going up.	Nakanjani ukuya phezulu.
At times, that may not seem to be the case.	Ngezinye izikhathi, kubonakala sengathi akunjalo.
I think you will too.	Ngicabanga ukuthi nawe uzokwenza.
Yes, you need a new one.	Yebo, udinga entsha.
Not enough money.	Ayikho imali eyanele.
It's not my problem.	Akuyona inkinga yami.
He works hard and does a good job.	Usebenza kanzima futhi wenza umsebenzi omuhle.
He can walk.	Angakwazi ukuhamba.
You read a little.	Ufunda kancane.
I doubt that will be easy.	Ngiyangabaza ukuthi lokho kuzoba lula.
I will do the right thing.	Ngizokwenza into efanele.
I don't like it either.	Nami angithandi.
Too much too much.	Okuningi kakhulu okuningi.
I can't do anything else.	Angikwazi ukwenza okunye.
If you do.	Uma wenza.
You need to think about that.	Udinga ukucabanga ngalokho.
I knew this could happen.	Ngangazi ukuthi lokhu kungenzeka.
But that's me.	Kodwa yimi lowo.
I don’t know how he started anywhere.	Angazi ukuthi waqala kanjani noma kuphi.
And dad.	Futhi ubaba.
It is actually harder than that.	Empeleni kunzima kunalokho.
But he could not get out.	Kodwa akakwazanga ukuphuma.
Or really, question.	Noma ngempela, umbuzo.
And this is true.	Futhi lokhu kuyiqiniso.
I need to know how this happened.	Ngidinga ukwazi ukuthi kwenzeka kanjani lokhu.
And he couldn't think of it tomorrow, either.	Futhi akakwazanga ukucabanga ngakho kusasa, futhi.
He knew he would win.	Wayazi ukuthi uzowina.
He opened another.	Wavula enye.
You look very much like me, when you think about it.	Ufana nami kakhulu, uma ucabanga ngakho.
The work took a few hours.	Umsebenzi wathatha amahora ambalwa.
And he did this in just three years.	Futhi lokhu wakwenza eminyakeni emithathu nje kuphela.
A really new, wonderful friend.	Umngane omusha ngempela, omuhle kakhulu.

You need a team.	Udinga iqembu.

And every day for a whole week.	Futhi njalo nsuku zonke isonto lonke.
He only loves money.	Uthanda imali kuphela.

He said he wanted to retire.	Uthe ufuna ukuthatha umhlalaphansi.
I never told you that.	Angikaze ngikutshele lokho.

But that would be a mistake.	Kodwa lokho kungaba iphutha.
Maybe that would be great.	Mhlawumbe lokho kungaba kuhle kakhulu.
So do you.	Kanjalo nawe.

I know you will.	Ngiyazi ukuthi uzokwenza.
I know what you look like.	Ngiyazi ukuthi ubukeka kanjani.

This happens all the time.	Lokhu kwenzeka njalo.
For me for the first time.	Kimi okokuqala.
But that is not the whole story.	Kodwa akuyona yonke indaba leyo.

This has never happened to me.	Angikaze kwenzeke lokhu kimi.
Too much.	Ngokweqile.

It happened that way.	Kwenzeka kanjalo.
He went out with us.	Waphuma kanye nathi.
In between	Phakathi
He has never read a book.	Akakaze afunde incwadi.

Then just his eyes.	Khona amehlo akhe nje.
But I heard.	Kodwa ngizwe.

But not in a good way.	Kodwa hhayi ngendlela enhle.
No mistake now.	Akukho iphutha manje.
Or because nothing is happening.	Noma ngoba akukho okwenzekayo.
I did not want to do this.	Ngangingafuni ukwenza lokhu.
But only one.	Kodwa eyodwa kuphela.
I could not stop.	Angikwazanga ukuyeka.
He has done nothing.	Akukho akwenzile.
I know why.	Ngiyazi ukuthi kungani.
I pretend not to see.	Ngenza sengathi angiboni.
A few years ago right now.	Eminyakeni embalwa edlule okwamanje.
The view is beautiful, too.	Umbono muhle, futhi.
Just a friend.	Umngane nje.
There is plenty of time !.	Kukhona isikhathi esiningi!.
Apparently he is.	Ngokusobala nguye.

It happened slowly.	Kwenzeka kancane kancane.
He wanted to do his job.	Wayefuna ukwenza umsebenzi wakhe.
I can't believe it.	Angikholwa kunalokho.

It happened so fast.	Kwenzeka ngokushesha okukhulu.
It can be anything.	Kungaba noma yini.
Finally, he decided to try another approach.	Ekugcineni, wanquma ukuzama enye indlela.
That's fine with me.	Kulungile nami.
But, yes, that's the whole thing.	Kodwa, yebo, yilokho yonke into.
I better stay here.	Kungcono ngihlale lapha.
Have you ever been to a restaurant?	Wake waya endaweni yokudlela?
I suspect	Ngiyasola
You are not sure.	Awazi kahle.
He spoke his mind.	Wakhuluma umqondo wakhe.
I thought you knew.	Bengithi uyazi.
Everyone knows what to do.	Wonke umuntu uyazi ukuthi enzeni.
Being alone is very good.	Ukuba yedwa kuhle kakhulu.
Nor should I have to be this way.	Akumele futhi akumele ngibe ngale ndlela.
I think you need to do that a little bit.	Ngicabanga ukuthi udinga ukwenza lokho kancane.
Really great.	Enkulu ngempela.
Nothing should happen to him.	Akumele kwenzeke lutho kuye.

So now, at last, something could happen.	Ngakho manje, ekugcineni, kungenzeka okuthile.

The food is good.	Ukudla kuhle.
I don't know what happened to him.	Angazi ukuthi kwenzekani ngaye.

We want to know more about it.	Sifuna ukwazi okwengeziwe ngayo.
This is really obvious!	Lokhu kusobala ngempela!
She agreed to marry him.	Wavuma ukushada naye.
My mother was no better.	Umama wayengekho ngcono.
You may be asleep.	Kungenzeka ukuthi ulele.
He is not here today.	Akekho lapha namuhla.
Don't make this easy!	Ungakwenzi kube lula lokhu!
But he wanted to talk about it.	Kodwa wayefuna ukukhuluma ngakho.
I want to be here again now.	Ngifuna ukuba lapha futhi manje.
Life without him or death.	Ukuphila ngaphandle kwakhe noma ukufa.
Since then, he has been looking for work.	Kusukela lapho, ubelokhu efuna umsebenzi.
He said, fine.	Wathi, kuhle.
But no one is there.	Kodwa akukho muntu lapho.

This was easy to fix.	Lokhu kube lula ukulungisa.
This has been very helpful.	Lokhu kube usizo kakhulu.

Maybe you say no.	Mhlawumbe uthi cha.

But he was afraid.	Kodwa wayesaba.
You are not.	Awuyena.
What did you do today at your job ?.	Wenzeni namuhla emsebenzini wakho?.
Good son.	Indodana enhle.
We just can't do anything about him here.	Asikwazi nje ukwenza lutho ngaye lapha.
I thought there was something wrong.	Bengicabanga ukuthi kukhona iphutha.
But he could not do that.	Kodwa akakwazanga ukwenza lokho.
I did not know when and how it would happen.	Ngangingazi ukuthi kuzokwenzeka nini futhi kanjani.

Not much, perhaps, but something else.	Hhayi okuningi, mhlawumbe, kodwa okunye.
Something is wrong with this.	Kukhona okwenzekayo ngale nto.
Thanks for now.	Ngiyabonga okwamanje.
It is difficult to live in a big city.	Kunzima ukuhlala edolobheni elikhulu.

Same thing with that.	Into efanayo nalokho.
You know you can.	Uyazi ungakwazi.

It could be weeks.	Kungaba amasonto.
Do you think that you are coming to me?	Ucabanga ukuthi uyeza kimi?

I wanted a story.	Bengifuna indaba.
He comes and stays in his house.	Afike ahlale endlini yakhe.
How can this be.	Kungenzeka kanjani lokhu.
He’s not a bad person, it’s just hard to read.	Akayena umuntu omubi, kunzima nje ukufunda.
Simply put, you are wrong.	Kalula nje, unephutha.
Nothing great at all.	Akukho okukhulu nhlobo.
You think.	Ucabanga kanjalo.
He often ate dinner with his family.	Wayevame ukudla isidlo sakusihlwa nomndeni wakhe.
It will be very difficult.	Kuzoba nzima kakhulu.
If you want this, fine.	Uma ufuna lokhu, kuhle.
He sat down, walking as slowly as possible.	Wahlala, ehamba kancane ngangokunokwenzeka.
It will be a while.	Kuzoba isikhashana.
And we are not.	Futhi asikho.
I just need to talk to you.	Ngidinga nje ukukhuluma nawe.
Probably nothing.	Mhlawumbe akukho lutho.
I am happy to be doing this work.	Ngijabule ngokwenza lo msebenzi.
I will never tell you again.	Angeke ngiphinde ngikutshele.
You should do a test now.	Kufanele wenze ukuhlolwa manje.
I need to get home.	Ngidinga ukufika ekhaya.
I'm so happy for you both.	Ngijabule kakhulu ngani nobabili.
So now my question is.	Ngakho manje umbuzo wami uthi.
I think it might be something else.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kungase kube okunye.
This job requires a lot of money.	Lo msebenzi udinga imali eningi.
He decided to walk the earth.	Wanquma ukuhamba emhlabeni.
I know it's hard.	Ngiyazi ukuthi kunzima.
Well people too.	Kahle abantu futhi.
The boy does not want to talk about what happened.	Umfana akafuni ukukhuluma ngokwenzekile.
He was.	Ube kade.
She wants a new dress.	Ufuna ingubo entsha.
Did you mean he did it.	Ngabe usho ukuthi wakwenza.
He is not at home except me.	Akekho ekhaya ngaphandle kwami.
He did not leave.	Akazange ahambe.
Yes, you should.	Yebo, kufanele.
No one has to help him.	Akekho okumele amsize.
No time for you, now.	Asikho isikhathi sakho, manje.
Good thing here.	Into enhle lapha.
So my question here.	Ngakho umbuzo wami lapha.
It seems like a moment.	Kubonakala sengathi isikhashana.
This is perfectly fine.	Lokhu kulungile ngokuphelele.
Yes, nothing else really happens.	Yebo, akukho okunye okwenzekayo ngempela.
I am the only one here.	Yimi ngedwa lapha.
I would really like it.	Ngingathanda ngempela.
I always.	Mina njalo .
You think you're going to be a big thing.	Ucabanga ukuthi uzoba into enkulu.
I asked what it was.	Ngabuza ukuthi yini.
I know so many things.	Ngazi izinto eziningi kakhulu.
But it is much better.	Kodwa kungcono kakhulu.
Vice versa.	Ngendlela efanayo.
Or a better life.	Noma impilo engcono.
I don't know if that's right.	Angazi ukuthi kunjalo yini.
Or you should know.	Noma kufanele ngabe uyazi.
He felt bad.	Wezwa kabi.
Is this the right approach?	Ingabe lena indlela efanele?
He started at that point.	Waqala ngaleso sikhathi.
This is not really true.	Lokhu akulona iqiniso ngempela.
He did not know many things.	Wayengazi izinto eziningi.
Better not, better not.	Kungcono hhayi, kungcono hhayi.
What a beautiful car.	Yeka imoto enhle.
He wanted to get out of here.	Wayefuna ukuphuma lapha.
But a few things.	Kodwa izinto ezimbalwa.
Yes, he did.	Yebo, wakwenza ngempela.
I can no longer do anything else.	angisakwazi ukwenza okunye.
I went to him.	Ngiye kuye.
Go to the hospital.	Aye esibhedlela.
Music is better.	Umculo ungcono.
Only big enough for me.	Kuphela okukhulu ngokwanele kimi.
So in the end, he goes alone.	Ngakho ekugcineni, uhamba yedwa.
What could that be.	Kungaba yini lokho.
Or you like.	Noma uthanda.
Even if it's me.	Noma ngabe yimina.
It sounds really cool.	Kuzwakala impela impela.
I don't think this is right.	Angicabangi ukuthi lokhu kulungile.
That's great this week.	Lokho kuhle kakhulu kuleli sonto.
But sometimes one has to.	Kodwa ngezinye izikhathi umuntu kufanele.
And so yes.	Futhi ngakho yebo.
Better, too.	Ongcono, futhi.
That is my case.	Icala lami lelo.
I can't say enough.	Angikwazi ukusho ngokwanele.
My life, his life.	Impilo yami, impilo yakhe.
It will take a few days.	Kuzothatha izinsuku ezimbalwa.
But that is just what has happened lately.	Kodwa yilokho nje okwenzeka muva nje.
We just know.	Siyazi nje.
This is not necessary.	Lokhu akudingekile.
Not a new person.	Hhayi umuntu omusha.
I think you did something wrong.	Ngicabanga ukuthi wenze into embi.
That is not here and it is not there.	Lokho akukho lapha futhi akukho lapho.
At least, not yet.	Okungenani, hhayi okwamanje.
He needs to make a decision.	Kudingeka enze isinqumo.
And in the morning.	Futhi ngesikhathi sasekuseni.
I'm just happy to be with you.	Ngiyajabula nje ukuba nawe.
He could not.	Ngabe akakwazanga.
I wish you .	Ngifisa ukuthi wena .
I know it seems, but it is not true.	Ngiyazi kubonakala kunjalo, kodwa akulona iqiniso.
This time, she agreed to go with me.	Kulokhu, wavuma ukuhamba nami.
Trying to be anywhere but right there, too.	Ezama ukuba noma iyiphi indawo kodwa khona lapho, naye.
I want to do something, be a human being.	Ngifuna ukwenza okuthile, ngibe umuntu.
I must not say anything else.	Akumele ngisho okunye.
Of course, water.	Kunjalo, amanzi.
He started eating his lunch.	Waqala ukudla ukudla kwakhe kwasemini.
But today is the day.	Kodwa namuhla usuku.
It may be.	Kungase kube khona.
This should not be done by children.	Lokhu akufanele kwenziwe izingane.
You would not eat.	Ubungeke udle.
Not everyone, of course.	Akuwona wonke umuntu, impela.
I have to say all the food, actually.	Kufanele ngisho konke ukudla, empeleni.
I do not know why it should be so.	Angazi ukuthi kungani kufanele kube njalo.
He says he just can't do it.	Uthi akakwazi nje ukukwenza.
I want to travel all over the world.	Ngifuna ukuhamba emhlabeni wonke.
He wanted to go to her, not to get to her.	Wayefuna ukuya kuye, hhayi ukuthi afike kuye.
I don't think so.	Angicabangi ukuthi yini.
Work, he said.	Umsebenzi, wathi.
But why do you do it this way?	Kodwa kungani wenza ngale ndlela?
That is not really the case.	Lokho akukhona ngempela okwenzekile.
Work needs to be permanent.	Umsebenzi kudingeka ahlale njalo.
Well, he thought.	Kulungile, wacabanga.
He wanted anyone.	Wayefuna noma ubani.
Yes he will.	Yebo uzokwenza lokho nakanjani.
Going to work.	Ukuya emsebenzini.
I'm sure you know about it.	Ngiqinisekile uyazi ngakho.
I didn't know you were here in the house.	Bengingazi ukuthi ulapha endlini.
And up in the years.	Futhi phezulu eminyakeni.
He won't talk about it.	Ngeke akhulume ngakho.
I'll have to think about that.	Kuzofanele ngicabange ngayo leyo.
But no.	Kodwa hhayi .
A really big house.	Indlu enkulu ngempela.
It would be nice to see you again.	Kungaba kuhle ukukubona futhi.
He pulled out a big book.	Wakhipha incwadi enkulu.
About a few days.	Cishe izinsuku ezimbalwa.
Quickly and quickly he spoke.	Ngokushesha futhi ngokushesha wakhuluma.
How about that.	Kanjani ngalokho.
You have to do better.	Kufanele wenze kangcono.
I can't really talk right now.	Angikwazi ukukhuluma ngempela manje.
He lives in my place.	Uhlala endaweni yami.
But it will take time.	Kodwa kuzothatha isikhathi.
Everything has been great.	Konke kube kuhle kakhulu.
Nothing about you here.	Akukho lutho ngawe lapha.
Obviously not for you.	Ngokusobala hhayi kuwe.
That death will not be good.	Ukuthi ukufa ngeke kube kuhle.
The problem is you.	Inkinga nguwe.
I knew it was there.	Ngangazi ukuthi kukhona.
I knew he would never come back.	Ngangazi ukuthi ngeke abuye.
And what a word.	Futhi yeka izwi.
You say something.	Usho okuthile.
You need to know.	Kuzomele wazi.
Please be here.	Ngicela ube lapha.
You did that.	Nguwe owenze lokho.
So that's why he lives alone, he thought.	Ngakho yingakho ehlala yedwa, wacabanga.
I need a room.	Ngidinga igumbi.
Not just for work, but for everything.	Hhayi nje ngomsebenzi, kodwa konke.
He knew something.	Wayazi okuthile.
I know this will not happen.	Ngiyazi ukuthi lokhu ngeke kwenzeke.
That is not a good name.	Akulona igama elihle lelo.
It has to be done.	Kufanele kwenziwe.
You told me so yourself.	Ungitshele kanjalo wena.
We will have to go to him.	Kuzofanele siye kuye.
Now you will.	Manje uzoba.
No, not us.	Cha, hhayi ngathi.
Everyone seems to be talking at the moment.	Wonke umuntu ubonakala ekhuluma ngaleso sikhathi.
At first, though.	Ekuqaleni, noma kunjalo.
However, we need to get a message from him.	Noma kunjalo, sidinga ukuthola umlayezo kuye.
Are you alright?	Ngabe uzizwa kanjani?
He has to go himself.	Kumele ahambe yena.
He could not sleep.	Akakwazanga ukulala .
Too many years.	Iminyaka eminingi kakhulu.
I would like more.	Ngingathanda okwengeziwe.
I wanted to know what was going on.	Bengifuna ukwazi ukuthi kwenzakalani.
So if you need more performance.	Ngakho uma udinga ukusebenza okwengeziwe.
When that happens, we do not need to do anything.	Uma kwenzeka, akudingeki senze lutho.
Therefore,.	Ngakho, .
Certainly a better life.	Impela impilo engcono.
We need to do that.	Kudingeka sikwenze lokho.
But no, he is not.	Kodwa cha, akuyena.
It could be.	Kungaba.
I want to know how and why and when.	Ngifuna ukwazi ukuthi kanjani futhi kungani futhi nini.
And no, it is not.	Futhi cha, akunjalo.
And alone.	Futhi yedwa.
I would like to know how you can do this better.	Ngingathanda ukwazi ukuthi ungakwenza kanjani lokhu kangcono.
You will do the right thing.	Uzokwenza okufanele.
Not so much, though.	Hhayi kakhulu, noma kunjalo.
No cooking.	Akukho ukupheka.
I also did not speak.	Nami angizange ngikhulume.
Even this.	Ngisho nalokhu.
He wants to see you.	Ufuna ukukubona.
Sound, sound, sound.	Umsindo, umsindo, umsindo.
However he did not speak.	Noma kunjalo akazange akhulume.
I would love for you to have this.	Ngingathanda ukuthi ube nalokhu.
He was not sure why.	Wayengenaso isiqiniseko sokuthi kungani.
If this happens once, it probably will happen again.	Uma lokhu kwenzeka kanye, mhlawumbe kungase kwenzeke futhi.
Or go again.	Noma uhambe futhi.
That is obviously the view.	Yilokho ngokusobala umbono.
Certainly his father.	Impela ubaba wakhe.
Now, he did.	Manje, wakwenza.
Finally! 	Ekugcineni!
There doesn't have to be one such thing.	Akudingekile ukuba kube khona into eyodwa enjalo.
He did a lot of people.	Wenza abantu abaningi.
Maybe no one else or anyone else.	Mhlawumbe akekho omunye noma omunye.
But not a question.	Kodwa hhayi umbuzo.
He wanted to get out of the house again.	Wayefuna ukuphuma futhi endlini.
That's really good.	Kuhle ngempela lokho.
He knows exactly why.	Uyazi kahle ukuthi kungani.
That is a fact.	Iqiniso lelo.
I like working in the house.	Ngithanda ukusebenza endlini.
He is now planning to retire soon.	Manje uhlela ukuthatha umhlalaphansi maduze.
Not just me.	Hhayi mina kuphela.
I wanted to go for a while.	Bengifuna ukuhamba isikhashana.
That is your decision.	Isinqumo sakho leso.
Maybe it's better this way.	Mhlawumbe kungcono ngale ndlela.
The longer it lasts, the better.	Uma isikhathi eside, ngcono.
You have to make one.	Kufanele wenze eyodwa.
We do so.	Senza kanjalo.
But maybe you want to go, to go home.	Kodwa mhlawumbe ufuna ukuhamba, ukuya ekhaya.
To be done.	Ukuze kwenziwe.
He did nothing about it.	Akazange enze lutho kulokho.
Why should you know?	Kungani kufanele wazi?
He is definitely going to jail.	Nakanjani uya ejele.
He said it would not happen to me.	Wathi ngeke kwenzeke kimi.
So you need to keep trying.	Ngakho udinga ukuqhubeka uzama.
I want to be human.	Ngifuna ukuba umuntu.
That too is possible.	Nalokho kungenzeka.
And the music is good.	Futhi umculo muhle.
I didn't know better.	Bengingazi kangcono.
And we need to know this.	Futhi sidinga ukwazi lokhu.
But that is not exactly how it happened.	Kodwa akunjalo ngempela ukuthi kwenzeka kanjani.
He knew for the first time.	Wayazi okokuqala.
He just walked out.	Wavele waphuma.
Bad idea.	Umbono omubi.
He must be my best friend.	Kumelwe abe umngane wami omkhulu kakhulu.
Maybe it's not a good idea now to think about it.	Mhlawumbe akuwona umqondo omuhle manje ukucabanga ngakho.
I really feel that way.	Impela ngizizwa kanjalo.
I was saying.	Bengithi.
I do not understand what is happening.	Angiqondi ukuthi kwenzakalani.
Tell mom you will be there.	Tshela umama ukuthi uzoba khona.
And one, and another.	Futhi omunye, futhi omunye.
He has been coming every year.	Ubelokhu efika njalo ngonyaka.
He was released from the hospital.	Waphuma esibhedlela.
So maybe.	Ngakho mhlawumbe.
He works hard and rarely sleeps.	Usebenza kanzima futhi akavamile ukulala.
This is quite a lot.	Lokhu kuningi impela.
It has to happen.	Kudingeka kwenzeke.
Someone knew what it looked like.	Omunye wayazi ukuthi kubukeka kanjani.
At least with me.	Okungenani nami.
He lives at home.	Uhlala ekhaya.
Looks like you got really good.	Kubonakala sengathi uthole enhle ngempela.
Or still.	Noma namanje.
He really should have gone to school.	Impela bekufanele aye esikoleni.
There is something very wrong.	Kukhona okubi kakhulu.
I did not know that anyone was really doing that.	Ngangingazi ukuthi ukhona owenza lokho ngempela.
I can't.	Angeke ngikwazi.
The only question is how fast.	Umbuzo kuphela ukuthi ngokushesha kangakanani.
It had to be easy.	Kwakufanele kube lula.
It's just me.	Yimi nje.
Later, she thought.	Kamuva, wacabanga.
I did not say this.	Angizange ngisho lokhu.
There is nothing else he can do.	Akukho okunye angakwenza.
That's a good thing about this.	Yinto enhle leyo ngalokhu.
Crying.	Ukukhala.
He just didn't want to.	Wayengafuni nje.
But still it is no better.	Kodwa noma kunjalo akukho ngcono.
And this is so.	Futhi lokhu kunjalo.
One learns by making mistakes.	Umuntu ufunda ngokwenza amaphutha.
So? 	Ngakho?
I'm just trying to be myself.	Ngizama nje ukuba yimi.
He can have it.	Angaba nakho.
I have to find a way to make this happen.	Kufanele ngithole indlela yokwenza lokhu kwenzeke.
I can't believe it though.	Angikholwa kodwa.
So it really is and it is true.	Ngakho empeleni kukhona futhi kuyiqiniso.
I apologize earlier.	Ngiyaxolisa ngaphambili.
He knew he didn't want to.	Wayazi ukuthi akafuni.
Children, family, what help.	Izingane, umndeni, yini usizo.
It just isn't.	Akukhona nje.
It should be easy.	Kufanele kube lula.
In this case, it is good.	Kulokhu, kuhle.
How do you say.	Usho kanjani.
He knew everything and nothing.	Wayazi yonke into futhi lutho.
I know it seems like a lot.	Ngiyazi kubonakala sengathi kuningi.
It should be now.	Kufanele kube manje.
I'm trying to figure out how to do that.	Ngizama ukuthola ukuthi ngingakwenza kanjani lokho.
In this case it is just me.	Kulokhu yimina nje.
I think you made a big mistake.	Ngicabanga ukuthi wenza iphutha elikhulu.
This is a really good book.	Lena incwadi enhle ngempela.
Very good, indeed.	Kuhle kakhulu, impela.
He can make sense of it.	Angakwazi ukwenza umqondo ngakho.
Anything can happen if you are determined enough.	Kungenzeka noma yini uma uzimisele ngokwanele.
I want him to do it.	Ngifuna akwenze.
I need that book.	Ngidinga leyo ncwadi.
I know a lot of people.	Ngiyazi abantu abaningi.
And that is probably the best.	Futhi lokho mhlawumbe kungcono kakhulu.
Actually no, it is not.	Empeleni cha, akunjalo.
This can be anything.	Lokhu kungaba noma yini.
That's the problem.	Inkinga leyo.
He talks a lot about his work.	Ukhuluma kakhulu ngomsebenzi wakhe.
And we are not really going anywhere.	Futhi ngeke siye ndawo ngempela.
He is very afraid of the loud noise.	Wesaba kakhulu umsindo omkhulu.
All he has to do is tell the truth.	Okufanele akwenze ukukhuluma iqiniso.
He refused to speak.	Wenqaba ukukhuluma.
But that's okay, you don't need everyone.	Kodwa lokho kulungile, awudingi wonke umuntu.
Three hours. 	Amahora amathathu. 
But he would not have it.	Kodwa wayengeke abe nakho.
Even he did.	Ngisho naye wenza.
He says yes.	Uthi yebo.
You can't say anything right now.	Awukwazi ukusho lutho okwamanje.
Not at first, at least.	Hhayi ekuqaleni, okungenani.
You know you shouldn't be here.	Uyazi ukuthi akufanele ube lapha.
In this case, there is nothing.	Kulokhu, akukho lutho.
If you want to play, you will need a ball.	Uma ufuna ukudlala, uzodinga ibhola.
I never thought about it, to be honest.	Angikaze ngicabange ngakho, uma ngikhuluma iqiniso.
This should be fine.	Lokhu kumele kube kuhle.
I wanted more.	Ngangifuna okwengeziwe.
He will have to do a test.	Kuzodingeka enze ukuhlolwa.
Only, he did not have enough time.	Kuphela, wayengenaso isikhathi esanele.
But in this case, it is not.	Kodwa kulokhu, akunjalo.
He was going to be a doctor, a good job.	Wayezoba udokotela, umsebenzi omuhle.
You did a really good job.	Wenze umsebenzi omuhle ngempela.
He did not sit down.	Akazange ahlale phansi.
You just know what should happen.	Uyazi nje ukuthi kufanele kwenzekeni.
I can't believe it at all.	Angikholwa neze mina.
I'm happy about it.	Ngiyajabula ngakho.
He will be going with us.	Uzobe ehamba nathi.
You have breakfast in the morning	Udla isidlo sasekuseni ekuseni
Maybe someone knows more.	Mhlawumbe othile wazi okwengeziwe.
He decided he had to leave.	Wanquma ukuthi kuzomele ahambe.
I have never seen it before.	Angikaze ngibone ngaphambili.
Nothing is right.	Akukho okufanele.
I do it every day.	Ngenza nsuku zonke.
Restaurant, restaurant.	Indawo yokudlela, indawo yokudlela.
He doesn't want to talk about it.	Akafuni ukukhuluma ngayo.
In this case, you have to make a decision.	Kulokhu, kufanele wenze isinqumo.
I did all that.	Ngikwenze konke lokho.
And that happened.	Futhi lokho kwenzeka.
On earth.	Emhlabeni.
Well done to you !!.	Kahle wena!!.
I have to get home.	Kumele ngifike ekhaya.
I just don't know about that.	Angazi nje ngalokho.
That is not enough time.	Leso akusona isikhathi esanele.
He heard.	Wezwa.
Once I have to do it.	Kanye kuzofanele ngenze.
I really wish there was a way to do this.	Ngifisa ngempela kube khona indlela yokwenza lokhu.
You should not have gone with you.	Bekungafanele uhambe nawe.
We did very well.	Senze kahle kakhulu.
There is nothing too big or something like that.	Ayikho into enkulu kakhulu noma into enjalo.
Obviously that will not happen now.	Ngokusobala lokho ngeke kwenzeke manje.
But he did.	Kodwa ukwenzile.
Something happened to him.	Kukhona okwenzeka kuye.
He went in.	Wangena yena.
Yes, that's right.	Yebo, kulungile.
Same problem.	Inkinga efanayo.
I wanted to say.	Bengifuna ukusho.
That is nothing new.	Akuyona into entsha leyo.
But is it really.	Kodwa ingabe ngempela.
My mother did not know what to do with me.	Umama wayengazi ukuthi enzeni ngami.
His health, his job.	Impilo yakhe, umsebenzi wakhe.
As soon as possible, right?	Ngokushesha ngakho, akunjalo?
We want to do it.	Sifuna ukukwenza.
But you should not think too highly of me.	Kodwa akumele ucabange kahle kakhulu ngami.
There are no guns yet.	Asikho isibhamu okwamanje.
He looked bad.	Wayebukeka kabi.
In this case, it is not.	Kulokhu, akunjalo.
I will not be happy about it.	Ngeke ngijabule ngakho.
I wanted him to do anything and everything.	Bengifuna enze noma yini nakho konke.
Yes, it is true.	Yebo, kuyiqiniso.
This is until this morning.	Lokhu kuze kube namuhla ekuseni.
Another problem.	Enye inkinga.
I had to leave immediately.	Kwadingeka ngihambe ngokushesha.
Not much time.	Asikho isikhathi esiningi.
It will take years to do so.	Kuzothatha iminyaka ukwenza kanjalo.
I think everyone should too !.	Ngicabanga ukuthi wonke umuntu kufanele futhi!.
I'm glad he's not in that.	Ngiyajabula ukuthi akekho kulokho.
He could not speak.	Wayengeke akhulume.
He was afraid to go to prison.	Wayesaba ukuya ejele.
I would love to hear from you.	Ngingathanda ukuzwa kuwe.
Try to sleep.	Azame ukulala.
So the adjustment may be minimal.	Ngakho ukulungisa kungase kube kancane.
You should arrive in the morning.	Kufanele ufike ekuseni.
And we did well.	Futhi senze kahle.
Not all of this.	Akukhona konke lokhu.
You always know.	Njalo uyazi.
Yes, this is fine for me.	Yebo, lokhu kulungile kimi.
He would not return.	Wayengeke abuye.
He thought.	Wacabanga.
With this book.	Ngale ncwadi.
We know this is not true.	Siyazi ukuthi lokhu akulona iqiniso.
I mean you're a human being.	Ngisho ukuthi ungumuntu.
It's got to be tonight.	Kuzofanele kube namhlanje ebusuku.
I just didn’t think about this.	Angizange nje ngicabange ngalokhu.
If it happens.	Uma kwenzeka.
Not nearly as much as it should be.	Hhayi cishe kakhulu njengoba kufanele.
Not a car.	Hhayi imoto.
You have never done this before.	Awukaze ukwenze lokhu ngaphambilini.
You should be happy.	Kufanele ujabule.
We need something new, new.	Sidinga into entsha, entsha.
It certainly will.	Impela kuzoba njalo.
Very good, almost.	Kuhle kakhulu, cishe.
It was not difficult,.	Akuzange kube nzima,.
Right now she is afraid to do the job.	Njengamanje uyesaba ukwenza umsebenzi.
I would like to tell her mom about it.	Ngingathanda ukutshela umama wakhe ngalokho.
He's just better than me today.	Ungcono nje kunami namuhla.
He kept thinking.	Wahlala wacabanga.
You too, or stop.	Nawe, noma yeka.
You will be, too.	Uzoba njalo, nawe.
He will not return.	Ngeke abuye.
I do not know when or how or why.	Angazi ukuthi nini noma kanjani noma ngani.
Worse than that, I say.	Okubi kunalokho, ngisho.
You also know where you are going.	Nami uyazi lapho uya khona.
I doubt a lot of people.	Ngiyangabaza abantu abaningi.
Or late, recently.	Noma kade, muva nje.
Maybe, maybe.	Mhlawumbe, mhlawumbe.
It is not a new story.	Akuyona indaba entsha.
Really, it should not.	Ngempela, akufanele.
Not entirely, at least.	Hhayi ngokuphelele, okungenani.
But he is not here right now, and he is here.	Kodwa akekho lapha njengamanje, futhi ukhona.
He entered the house.	Wangena endlini.
Or not so much at this time.	Noma hhayi kakhulu ngalesi sikhathi.
Reading.	Ukufunda.

Everyone has been here before.	Wonke umuntu uke waba lapha.
It should not be done.	Akumele kwenziwe.
If you really want to do it yourself.	Uma ngempela ufuna ukuzenza.
He did it.	Ukwenzile.
Sometimes a little, sometimes completely.	Ngezinye izikhathi kancane, ngezinye izikhathi ngokuphelele.
You know my whole life.	Wazi impilo yami yonke.
Of course this is not true.	Yebo lokhu akulona iqiniso.
I am very happy for myself.	Ngijabule kakhulu ngami.
He was afraid he would not do it.	Wayesaba ukuthi angakwenzi.
But this is perfectly clear from the beginning.	Kodwa lokhu kusobala ngokuphelele kusukela ekuqaleni.
He did not stay long at that time.	Akazange ahlale isikhathi eside ngaleso sikhathi.
At least.	Okungenani.
There is nothing he can do.	Akukho angakwenza.
But it would be nice.	Kodwa kungaba kuhle.
We did it together.	Sikwenze ndawonye.
So he left early this morning.	Ngakho uhambe ekuseni kangaka.

You should never have won and you know.	Bekungafanele neze awine futhi uyazi.
You've been here before, haven't you?	Uke waba lapha ngaphambilini, akunjalo?
And he never has.	Futhi akakaze abe nakho.
Work is needed.	Kudingeka umsebenzi.
I just started.	Ngisanda kuqala.
You really should know that.	Kufanele ukwazi ngempela lokho.
He talks about everything.	Ukhuluma ngayo yonke into.
But not as before.	Kodwa hhayi njengakuqala.
I don't want anything.	Angifuni lutho .
I will not tell you.	Ngeke ngikutshele.

And eat something.	Futhi udle okuthile.
Today it is so.	Namuhla kunjalo.
Life Yes, food.	Ukuphila Yebo, ukudla.

All or nothing, he said.	Konke noma lutho, wathi.
Danger and very bad there.	Ingozi futhi embi kakhulu lapho.
He said he had to leave.	Wathi kuzomele ahambe.
She's worried about him too.	Naye ukhathazekile ngaye.
This would be good for him.	Lokhu kungaba kuhle kuye.
He did not want to come here.	Wayengafuni ukuza lapha.
That's really nice to see.	Lokho kuhle ngempela ukukubona.
That's my picture.	Isithombe sami leso.
Please tell me.	Ngicela ungitshele.

I could not go to him.	Angikwazanga ukuya kuye.
That's the whole thing.	Yilokho yonke into.
But we did nothing.	Kodwa asizange senze lutho.
I like traveling a lot.	Ngithanda ukuhamba kakhulu.
I am really happy.	Ngijabule ngempela.
He walked away.	Wahamba wahamba.
It's hard to do everything.	Kunzima ukwenza yonke into.
Please go now.	Ngicela uhambe manje.
Only permission is required.	Kudingeka imvume kuphela.
And now the weekend is finally over.	Futhi manje ngempelasonto ekugcineni.
Anyway, you know.	Noma kunjalo, uyazi.
A job should only do one thing.	Umsebenzi kufanele wenze into eyodwa kuphela.
But again, this is not the case with us.	Kodwa futhi, akunjalo kithi.

Why is that? 	Kungani kunjalo?
He came out immediately.	Waphuma ngokushesha.

Help! 	Usizo!

Nothing was needed.	Kwadingeka lutho.
Lots of pictures.	Izithombe eziningi.
When we need it.	Lapho sidinga.
There is no way in the world.	Ayikho indlela emhlabeni.
I had to think quickly about what to do.	Kwadingeka ngicabange ngokushesha ukuthi ngenzeni.
When did this happen?	Kwenzeka nini lokhu?
He seems unable to drive.	Kubonakala sengathi akakwazi ukushayela.
No one is coming.	Akekho ozayo.
I do not know what the problem is here.	Angazi ukuthi yini inkinga lapha.
Also, he heard something.	Futhi, wezwa okuthile.
That would be a big deal.	Lokho kungaba yinto enkulu.
No, it is not necessary, no.	Cha, akudingekile, cha.

Do you want to go to town?	Uyafuna ukuya edolobheni?
There is no place for him here.	Ayikho indawo yakhe lapha.
But he was not so sure.	Kodwa wayengenaso isiqiniseko kangako.
I went well.	Ngihambe kahle.
Because it will definitely happen.	Ngoba kuzokwenzeka nakanjani.
Where you do you will know.	Lapho wenza khona uzokwazi.
It is not necessary in one place.	Akudingekile endaweni eyodwa.
You have been.	Uke waba .
The water should stop.	Amanzi kufanele ayeke.
It is not breakfast.	Akusona isidlo sasekuseni.
He will be here with us.	Uzoba lapha nathi.
Tell me more.	Ngitshele okunye.
But he can't control himself.	Kodwa akakwazi ukuzibamba.

He thought it was good.	Wayecabanga ukuthi kuhle.
I will not say.	Ngeke ngisho.
And another, if necessary.	Futhi enye, uma kudingeka.

There is something you need to know.	Kukhona okufanele ukwazi.
And children.	Futhi izingane.
I wonder if he was ever here.	Kazi wake waba lapha.
No one really knows what to do.	Akekho owaziyo ngempela ukuthi yini okufanele ayenze.
Then there is the problem.	Khona inkinga.
He really had to go.	Kwadingeka ahambe ngempela.
And maybe he did.	Futhi mhlawumbe wakwenza.

He refused to cry.	Wenqaba ukukhala.
But not this one.	Kodwa hhayi lokhu.
He told me exactly how he was going to do it.	Wangitshela kahle ukuthi uzokwenza kanjani.
You should do this every day.	Kufanele ukwenze lokhu nsuku zonke.
And you have to be that.	Futhi kufanele ube yilokho.
And he can be.	Futhi angaba.
We just want to stay here at night.	Sifuna nje ukuhlala lapha ebusuku.
Not too high, not too low.	Hhayi phezulu kakhulu, hhayi phansi kakhulu.
Just to be.	Ukuze kube nje.
Without him.	Ngaphandle kwakhe.
He took your place.	Wathatha indawo yakho.
He may have it.	Angase abe nakho.
It's hard to know.	Kunzima ukwazi.
But, again, maybe not.	Kodwa, futhi, mhlawumbe akunjalo.
Trying to figure out why.	Ukuzama ukuthola ukuthi kungani.
No, not you.	Cha, hhayi wena.
No testing, nothing.	Akukho ukuhlolwa, lutho.
I have not been able to do anything right now.	Angikwazanga ukwenza lutho okwamanje.
And I'm happy too.	Futhi ngijabule futhi.

He should not be alone.	Akumele ahlale yedwa.
This happened everywhere, by the way.	Lokhu kwenzeke yonke indawo, ngendlela.
The question is when.	Umbuzo uthi nini.
At home.	Ekhaya.
Too long reading.	Ukufunda isikhathi eside kakhulu.
That has been a long time coming.	Sekunesikhathi eside kwenzeka lokho.
This will take a very long time.	Lokhu kuzothatha isikhathi eside kakhulu.
This is not my story.	Lokhu akuyona indaba yami.
All or nothing.	Konke noma lutho.
And it will be.	Futhi kuzoba njalo.
This is our mother.	Umama wethu lo.
But we did not.	Kodwa asizange.
For now, it is.	Okwamanje, kunjalo.
No reason, either.	Asikho isizathu, noma.
He sits there every day.	Uhlezi lapho zonke izinsuku.
He didn't, really.	Naye akazange, ngempela.
And, just my opinion.	Futhi, umbono wami nje.
The same weekend.	Ngempelasonto efanayo.
He just wanted to play with her.	Wayefuna ukudlala naye kuphela.
He probably did.	Cishe wakwenza.
You must have thought about it before.	Kufanele ngabe uke wacabanga ngakho ngaphambili.
Someone made that happen.	Omunye umuntu wenze lokho kwenzeke.
I want a very small dog.	Ngifuna inja encane kabi.
You too can do that.	Nawe kungenzeka.
That we had to go.	Ukuthi bekumele sihambe.
Or better yet.	Noma kungcono okwamanje.
I never thought of anything about it.	Angikaze ngicabange lutho ngakho.
I sit up in bed.	Ngihlale embhedeni.
I don't know how that will happen.	Angazi ukuthi lokho kuzokwenzeka kanjani.
I'll go, thank you.	Ngizohamba, ngiyabonga.
You can do it now.	Ungakwenza manje.
I don't really understand why.	Angiqondi ngempela ukuthi kungani.
And that might be okay.	Futhi lokho kungase kube kulungile.
We have to do a better job at it.	Kufanele senze umsebenzi ongcono ngakho.
I don’t really think about it.	Angicabangi ngakho ngempela.
Most of the time you can do this alone.	Isikhathi esiningi ungakwenza lokhu uwedwa.
It's hard to make friends.	Kunzima ukwenza abangani.
He said my baby.	Wathi ingane yami.
And just like that, he never came back.	Futhi kanjalo nje, akazange abuye.
That's a very good idea.	Umbono omuhle kakhulu lowo.
He knew he shouldn't do that.	Wayazi ukuthi kwakungafanele enze lokho.
It's just hard.	Kunzima nje.
No he came out like that.	Hhayi waphuma kanjalo.
He plays tennis well.	Udlala ithenisi kahle.
I would never have thought that this would happen.	Angisoze ngacabanga ukuthi lokhu kuzokwenzeka.
Or maybe there is.	Noma mhlawumbe kukhona.
But in this case, that would be impossible.	Kodwa kulokhu kuzoba nzima lokho.
I know, because that's what happened to me.	Ngiyazi, ngoba yilokho okwenzeka kimi.
He will not be.	Ngeke abe.
In the end, life can be difficult.	Ekugcineni, ukuphila kungaba nzima.
You don't even know this.	Awukwazi nalokhu.
I will go alone.	Ngizohamba ngedwa.
Because man has to.	Ngoba umuntu kufanele.
No one.	Akekho umuntu.
One and only.	Eyodwa futhi kuphela.
I don’t want you to think a bit about me.	Angifuni ukuthi ucabange kancane ngami.
Sit down.	Ahlale phansi.
So we have to go.	Ngakho kufanele sihambe.
It seems obvious to me.	Kubonakala kusobala kimi.
You certainly know.	Impela uyazi.
My father died a few years ago.	Ubaba washona eminyakeni embalwa edlule.
He wondered about that.	Wazibuza ngalokho.
I could not find the error.	Angikwazanga ukuthola iphutha.
She is in the car.	Yena emotweni.
But it was wrong.	Kodwa kwakungafanele.
Not quite yet.	Hhayi impela okwamanje.
He was not a crowd.	Wayengeyena abantu abaningi.
I didn’t really know what it could be.	Ngangingazi ngempela ukuthi kungaba yini.
Please, go now.	Ngicela, uhambe manje.
But it was worth it.	Kodwa kwakufanele.
He never talked about her.	Akakaze akhulume ngaye.
Why do you think this happened?	Ucabanga ukuthi kungani lokhu kwenzeka?
And it may be.	Futhi kungase kube njalo.
We want to know what happened.	Sifuna ukwazi ukuthi kwenzekeni.
He also would not say.	Naye ubengeke asho.
That is simply not true.	Akulona neze iqiniso.
He readily agreed.	Wavuma kakhulu.
He can't be.	Angeke abe.
Because he is not.	Ngoba akekho.
Or me.	Noma nami.
I think he will come later.	Ngicabanga ukuthi uzofika kamuva.
And you should be, too.	Futhi kufanele ube, futhi.
And this is not the way.	Futhi lena akuyona indlela.
The police will not come here.	Amaphoyisa ngeke eze lapha.
Yes, everyone wanted to get there first.	Yebo, wonke umuntu wayefuna ukufika kuqala.
You will have that with him, but not for long.	Uzoba nakho lokho naye, kodwa hhayi isikhathi eside.
Will you be here next week?	Uzoba lapha ngesonto elizayo?

Nothing more.	Akukho okunye okuningi.
Few books.	Izincwadi ezimbalwa.

But he could not, not yet.	Kodwa akakwazanga, hhayi okwamanje.
We have had all these terrible things.	Sibe nakho konke lokhu okubi kakhulu.
He told me all about it.	Wangitshela konke ngakho.
Indeed, there is.	Ngempela, kukhona.
I doubt he will return.	Ngiyangabaza ukuthi uzobuya.
And, and again.	Futhi, futhi futhi.
He's just trying to help.	Uzama ukusiza nje.
And there is a dog.	Futhi kukhona inja.

This is nothing new.	Lokhu akuyona into entsha.

At home, at school.	Ekhaya, esikoleni.

Not really true.	Akulona iqiniso ngempela.
But, we did not.	Kodwa, asizange.
Went to a party last week?	Uye ephathini ngesonto eledlule?
You can't think of it.	Awukwazi ukucabanga ngakho.
I ask someone to help her.	Ngicela othile amsize.
I need more time.	Ngidinga isikhathi esengeziwe.
But it has to be.	Kodwa kufanele kube.
But he did not do that.	Kodwa akakwenzanga njalo.
That's your way.	Indlela yakho leyo.
Finally, Dad spoke up.	Ekugcineni, ubaba wakhuluma.
I'm scared.	Ngesaba mina.
I never thought it could be you.	Angikaze ngicabange ukuthi kungaba nguwe.
Of course not.	Yebo ngeke.
There is probably more.	Cishe kukhona okwengeziwe.
But, yes, it is me.	Kodwa, yebo, yimina.
I think it won't be long.	Ngicabanga ukuthi ngeke kube isikhathi eside.
Probably nothing to do at this time.	Mhlawumbe akukho okumele kwenziwe ngalesi sikhathi.
I will never see it again.	Ngeke ngiphinde ngibone.
It is very difficult for me to do.	Kunzima kakhulu kimi ukukwenza.
Everyone agreed.	Wonke umuntu wavuma ngalokho.
You love one, you love another.	Uthanda omunye, uthanda omunye.
And not again.	Futhi hhayi futhi.
I just didn't want to do my homework.	Ngangingafuni nje ukwenza umsebenzi wami wesikole.
But he asked anyway.	Kodwa wabuza noma kunjalo.
I think everyone is good.	Ngicabanga ukuthi wonke umuntu muhle.
There will be no problem.	Ngeke kube khona inkinga.
The biggest problem is his age.	Inkinga enkulu iminyaka yakhe.
And he will be leaving soon.	Futhi uzohamba maduze.
But he did not just talk.	Kodwa akazange nje akhulume.
You know there is no other way.	Uyazi ukuthi ayikho enye indlela.
This will be my reality next year.	Lokhu kuzoba iqiniso lami ngonyaka ozayo.
I thought this might be helpful for you to have.	Ngacabanga ukuthi lokhu kungase kube usizo kuwe ukuba ube nakho.
I can't believe he has been looking for me all this time.	Angikholwa ukuthi ubelokhu engifuna sonke lesi sikhathi.
Not water, not air, nothing.	Hhayi amanzi, hhayi umoya, lutho.
Travel.	Ukuhamba.
I never did.	Angikaze.
He may say or do anything.	Angase asho noma enze noma yini.
That is my job.	Umsebenzi wami lowo.
It may be so here.	Kungase kube njalo lapha.
But this is not a book really.	Kodwa lena akuyona incwadi ngempela.
You can't do that.	Awukwazi ukwenza kanjalo.
I see no other way.	Angiboni enye indlela.
He refused to drink.	Wenqaba ukuphuza.
This is often okay.	Lesi isikhathi esiningi kulungile.
No, he would not.	Cha, wayengeke.
He sat down for a while.	Wahlala phansi kancane.
I need to know what's going on here.	Kumele ngazi ukuthi kwenzakalani lapha.
I wanted to.	Bengifuna.
I do not want anyone to know.	Angifuni noma ubani azi.
It is very obvious.	Kusobala impela.
That really happened.	Lokho kwenzeka ngempela.
Finally he consented, and came to him.	Ekugcineni wavuma, weza kuye.
My father or me.	Ubaba wami noma mina.
And maybe not.	Futhi mhlawumbe akunjalo.
He sat down, he thought.	Wahlala phansi, wacabanga.
But if it is true.	Kodwa uma kuyiqiniso.
But nothing he.	Kodwa lutho yena.
See if you do well.	Abone ukuthi wenza kahle.
When you go to class, you learn something.	Uma uya ekilasini, ufunda okuthile.
And that's not it.	Futhi akukhona lokho.
Everyone just knows that.	Wonke umuntu uyazi nje ukuthi.
Or, you know.	Noma, uyazi.
No, not people.	Cha, hhayi abantu.
She is also very happy.	Naye ujabule kakhulu.
Breakfast.	Isidlo sasekuseni.
Very nice person.	Umuntu omuhle kakhulu.
I'm really sorry, though.	Ngiyaxolisa ngempela, kodwa .
He knew he wasn't.	Wayazi ukuthi wayengeyena.
It's not his fault at all.	Akulona iphutha lakhe ngokuphelele.
He has to go to work every day.	Kumele aye emsebenzini nsuku zonke.
I've thought about it.	Ngike ngacabanga ngakho.
I know, but.	Ngiyazi, kodwa.
We know this is difficult.	Siyazi ukuthi lokhu kunzima.
I know it's hard to get into.	Ngiyazi ukuthi kunzima ukungena.
He did so and they said yes.	Wenze njalo bathi yebo.
He left in the morning.	Uhambe ekuseni.
And all in between.	Futhi konke phakathi.
He spoke to another.	Wakhuluma omunye.
To find out what's going on.	Ukuze uthole ukuthi kwenzakalani.
He didn't want to play with me.	Wayengafuni ukudlala nami.
Even if you are.	Noma ngabe ukhona.
But nowhere.	Kodwa akekho ndawo.
But there is another way.	Kodwa kukhona enye indlela.
But it should not be this way.	Kodwa akufanele kube ngale ndlela.
I can't wait to see that.	Angikwazi ukulinda ukubona lokho.
I am very happy about that.	Ngijabule kakhulu ngalokho.
Everything else, he did well.	Konke okunye, wenza kahle.
You have to think fast.	Kufanele ucabange ngokushesha.
He never did.	Akakaze.
He couldn't think of this yet.	Akakwazanga ukucabanga ngalokhu okwamanje.
Instead he started driving in the city.	Kunalokho waqala ukushayela edolobheni.
I'm trying to find out.	Ngizama ukuthola.
Very little.	Kancane impela.
Not that it was necessary.	Hhayi ukuthi kwakudingeka.
he comes every morning.	uyeza njalo ekuseni.
But this is exactly it.	Kodwa lokhu kanye.
I should be doing my job.	Kufanele ngabe ngenza umsebenzi wami.
So you are probably very happy.	Ngakho mhlawumbe ujabule kakhulu.
I am very happy to do this job.	Ngijabule kakhulu ukwenza lo msebenzi.
He said he had never been to such a beautiful place.	Wathi akakaze aye endaweni enhle kangaka.
This should be okay.	Lokhu kufanele kube kulungile.
I'm pretty sure what happened.	Ngikhuluma kahle ukuthi kwenzekeni.
There is a car in front.	Kukhona imoto ngaphambili.
I don't know that.	Angikwazi lokho.
It would certainly be great.	Impela kungaba kuhle.
She goes to school.	Uya esikoleni.
Sitting in his car.	Ehlala emotweni yakhe.
I'll get better with all of this.	Ngizoba ngcono ngayo yonke le nto.
It's not just talking here.	Akukhona nje ukukhuluma lapha.
I know you should have done it.	Ngiyazi bekufanele ukwenze.
Or at least he felt the same way.	Noma okungenani wazizwa ngendlela efanayo.
Yes, it can be difficult.	Yebo, kungaba nzima.
I know nothing happens to you.	Ngiyazi akukho okwenzeka kuwe.
Now I try to do this.	Manje ngizama ukwenza lokhu.
Thank you for your good work.	Ngiyabonga ngomsebenzi wakho omuhle.
We didn't do that, of course.	Asizange sikwenze lokho, kunjalo.
None of this.	Akukho kulokhu.
And not much time.	Futhi asikho isikhathi esiningi.
Do not do this to yourself.	Ungakwenzi lokhu kuwe.
There should be a lot more here.	Kufanele kube khona okuningi okwengeziwe lapha.
This may be the way to do it.	Lokhu kungase kube indlela yokwenza.
Not at work, not at home.	Hhayi emsebenzini, hhayi ekhaya.
He thought maybe he could.	Wayecabanga ukuthi mhlawumbe angakwenza.
But that's not my way.	Kodwa akuyona indlela yami leyo.
Stop trying to make sense of it all.	Yeka ukuzama ukwenza umqondo wakho konke.
But still so fast.	Kodwa noma kunjalo ngokushesha.
Yes, next week.	Yebo, ngesonto elizayo.
I wanted to do it now.	Bengifuna ukukwenza manje.
I didn't know about that.	Bengingazi ngalokho.
Another danger.	Enye ingozi.
She is one child.	Uyingane eyodwa.
You can do this early.	Ungakwenza lokhu kusenesikhathi.
We have committed a crime.	Senze icala.
That's all right.	Konke lokho kulungile.
I need to do something about it.	Ngidinga ukwenza okuthile ngayo.
Without you, it will not be possible.	Ngaphandle kwakho, ngeke kwenzeke.
I will go too.	Nami ngizohamba.
I will not lie to you.	Ngeke ngikutshele amanga.
He wanted me to leave.	Wayefuna ngihambe.
So he started walking.	Ngakho waqala ukuhamba.
Not that close, but close.	Hhayi ukuthi eduze, kodwa eduze.
A lot, actually.	Kuningi, empeleni.
Something happened, it happened, something happened.	Kukhona okwenzekile, kwenzeka, kukhona okwenzekayo.
Not a big car either.	Akuyona imoto enkulu futhi.
Because she is beautiful and beautiful.	Ngoba muhle futhi muhle.
He wanted to play.	Wayefuna ukudlala.
This can be a problem.	Lokhu kungase kube inkinga.
That is not the case.	Akuyona indaba leyo.
Certainly, he said.	Impela, wathi.
I know exactly what happened.	Ngiyazi kahle ukuthi kwenzekeni.
That should be easy.	Lokho kufanele kube lula.
You have to make a choice.	Kufanele wenze ukukhetha.
I did well on that.	Ngenze kahle ngalokho.
I think it should be helpful to us.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kufanele kube usizo kithi.
I try every day.	Ngizama nsuku zonke.
He's trying to get to you.	Uzama ukufika kuwe.
He can't say.	Angeke asho.
I don't want to know things.	Angifuni ukwazi izinto.
This is good enough as it is.	Lokhu kulungile ngokwanele njengoba kunjalo.
It really should.	Kufanele ngempela.
He said he felt alone.	Wathi uzizwa eyedwa.
But no, not before.	Kodwa cha, hhayi ngaphambili.
That's your job right now.	Lowo umsebenzi wakho njengamanje.
He went to her.	Waya kuye.
Maybe that's why.	Mhlawumbe yingakho.
At least, not for long, not today.	Okungenani, hhayi isikhathi eside, hhayi namuhla.
That's the plan.	Yilokho uhlelo.
Her mother was not at home.	Umama wakhe wayengekho ekhaya.
I want to know that as soon as possible.	Ngifuna ukwazi lokho ngokushesha ngangokunokwenzeka.
He got worse.	Wathola okubi kakhulu.
I've been here all week.	Isonto lonke ngilapha.
Or you can.	Noma ungakwazi.
That's life.	Impilo leyo.
I know why you are here.	Ngiyazi ukuthi kungani ulapha.
It can be very difficult.	Kungaba nzima impela.
So there is our answer.	Ngakho kukhona impendulo yethu.
I was not happy.	Angizange ngijabule.
I did not think there was.	Bengingacabangi ukuthi kukhona.
It's hard to imagine it.	Kunzima ukucabanga ngakho.
More water, less space.	Amanzi amaningi, indawo encane.
I really don't know.	Angikwazi ngempela.
Waiting is hard.	Ukulinda kunzima.
This morning has been really easy.	Lokhu ekuseni kube lula ngempela.
And, maybe he is.	Futhi, mhlawumbe nguye.
There is no money in that.	Ayikho imali kulokho.
He really wanted to go.	Wayefuna kakhulu ukuhamba.
It may be tomorrow.	Kungase kube kusasa.
He spoke but did not.	Wakhuluma kodwa akazange.
This is really happening.	Lokhu kwenzeka ngempela .
That is not a problem.	Akuyona inkinga leyo.
There is nothing to him.	Akukho lutho kuye.
I don't see why you do.	Angiboni ukuthi kungani wenza.
Not here, nowhere.	Hhayi lapha, akukho ndawo.
It is not dangerous.	Akuyona ingozi.
I think she is really good.	Ngicabanga ukuthi muhle ngempela.
Everyone knows what you have to do.	Wonke umuntu uyazi ukuthi kufanele ukwenze.
He was not sure about her, or about me.	Wayengenaso isiqiniseko ngaye, noma ngami.
That is not football.	Akulona ibhola lelo.
I can do nothing about this.	Angikwazi ukwenza lutho ngalokhu.
He told me a lot about him.	Wangitshela okuningi ngaye.
I can't really talk to him.	Angikwazi ukukhuluma naye ngempela.
You are probably the best player.	Cishe ungumdlali ongcono kakhulu.
But he did not have to.	Kodwa kwakungadingeki ukuba enze kanjalo.
What could be the problem.	Kungaba yini le nkinga.
She would like to sleep.	Angathanda ukulala.
He got there first.	Wafika kuqala lapho.
But that is not a new concept.	Kodwa lowo akuwona umqondo omusha.
At least, not entirely.	Okungenani, hhayi ngokuphelele.
He should not say anything.	Akumele asho lutho.
She is late for work.	Ufike sekwephuzile emsebenzini.
Everything has gotten better.	Konke kube ngcono.
I'm sure he'll be with you soon.	Ngiqinisekile uzoba nawe maduze.
Not a bad thing.	Akuyona into embi.
I think about him all the time.	Ngicabanga ngaye ngaso sonke isikhathi.
I wanted a few children.	Ngangifuna izingane ezimbalwa.
So it has to be me.	Ngakho kufanele kube yimina.
I don't know how he got it.	Angazi ukuthi wakwazi kanjani.
Talking about it.	Ekhuluma ngakho.
At least it seems so to me.	Okungenani kubonakala kanjalo kimi.
I have to wait.	Kuzomele ngilinde.
I can't now.	Angikwazi manje.
So he goes to a big city.	Ngalokho uya edolobheni elikhulu.
And your name ?.	Futhi igama lakho?.
You can't stay.	Awukwazi ukuhlala.
Everything should be very simple.	Konke kufanele kube lula kakhulu.
It was not human.	Kwakungeyena umuntu.
Now that I have found a few things about it.	Manje njengoba ngithole izinto ezimbalwa ngayo.
This is a big car.	Lena imoto enkulu.
He talked a little bit about that.	Wakhuluma kancane ngalokho.
He always has.	Uhlale njalo.
Because work exists.	Ngoba umsebenzi ukhona.
I just want to help you.	Ngifuna ukukusiza nje.
But this is not always the case.	Kodwa akunjalo ngaso sonke isikhathi.
He must go now, he thought.	Kumele ahambe manje, wacabanga.
Up here, too.	Phezulu lapha, futhi.
This job seems to do just that.	Lo msebenzi ubonakala wenze lokho.
He's up there.	Nguye phezulu lapho.
I'm sure he'll be back.	Ngiqinisekile uzobuya.
Sometimes, but not always.	Ngezinye izikhathi, kodwa hhayi njalo.
Here and everywhere.	Lapha futhi yonke indawo.
He lives at home now.	Uhlala ekhaya manje.
You've been here.	Kade ulapha.
And he is not a bad person at all.	Futhi akayena umuntu omubi noma yini.
I can't help you.	Angikwazi ukukusiza.
He once did.	Wake wenza.
It is true for me.	Kuyiqiniso kimi.
Probably all.	Mhlawumbe konke.
What happened is what happened.	Okwenzekile yilokho okwenzekile.
I should have known better.	Bekufanele ngikwazi kangcono.
This is not true of course.	Lokhu akulona iqiniso Yebo.
Really, that's great.	Ngempela, lokho kuhle kakhulu.
He wants me to go too.	Ufuna nami ngihambe.
He wanted to stay there.	Wayefuna ukuhlala lapho.
He looked better about it.	Wayebonakala engcono ngakho.
You want to get out, and you want to get out now.	Ufuna ukuphuma, futhi ufuna ukuphuma manje.
He finally told me so.	Ekugcineni wangitshela kanjalo.
I wonder about that.	Ngiyazibuza ngalokho .
I found my friend in this.	Ngithole umngane wami kulokhu.
Not here, not in him.	Hhayi lapha, hhayi kuye.
And people.	Futhi abantu.
He will have to go to hospital tomorrow.	Kuzofanele aye esibhedlela kusasa.
All right, enough.	Kulungile, ngokwanele.
What are you talking about.	Ukhuluma ngani.
But it has to happen.	Kodwa kufanele kwenzeke.
But that is not his phone.	Kodwa akulona ucingo lwakhe.
Too often.	Kaningi kakhulu.
To do anything about it.	Ukwenza noma yini ngakho.
I need to get back to work.	Ngidinga ukubuyela emsebenzini.
I try to stop thinking.	Ngizama ukuyeka ukucabanga.
What a wonderful opportunity!	Yeka ithuba elihle!
His mother couldn't.	Umama wakhe akakwazanga.
Absolutely false.	Amanga ngokuphelele.
His friend had to do it.	Umngane wakhe kwakufanele akwenze.
No, I will not.	Cha, ngeke ngiphinde.
He too began to sing.	Naye waqala ukucula.
You just don't need to say anything about it.	Awudingi nje ukusho lutho ngakho.
He has to do that perfectly.	Kufanele akwenze lokho ngokuphelele.
We did things.	Senze izinto.
I'm not sure if that's a good idea or not.	Anginaso isiqiniseko sokuthi umbono omuhle lowo noma cha.
I want to read a book.	Ngifuna ukufunda incwadi.
But that is not the same thing.	Kodwa lokho akuyona into efanayo.
Not many choices.	Akukhona ukukhetha okuningi.
He did not want to.	Akazange afune kanjalo.
I think this is the best way to do a lot of things.	Ngicabanga ukuthi lena indlela engcono kakhulu yokwenza izinto eziningi.
And he did.	Futhi ukwenze.
Stopping there.	Ukuyeka kukho.
I just can't tell you.	Angikwazi nje ukukutshela.
As hard as that is.	Njengoba kunzima kangakanani lokho.
This is possible.	Lokhu kungenzeka.
That is how your father came in.	Wangena kanjalo ubaba wakho.
I know what the problem is!	Ngiyazi ukuthi yini inkinga!
And no one else spoke to him.	Futhi akekho omunye akhulume naye.
I will not do this to you.	Ngeke ngikwenze lokhu nawe.
Because she is beautiful.	Ngoba muhle.
But maybe he is not.	Kodwa mhlawumbe akayena.
Good to be with you this morning.	Kuhle ukuba nawe namhlanje ekuseni.
Too much, perhaps.	Okuningi kakhulu, mhlawumbe.
The task became too difficult for him.	Umsebenzi waba nzima kakhulu kuye.
It is best to arrive early.	Kungcono ukufika kusenesikhathi.
I don't know if this is right.	Angazi noma kulungile yini lokhu.
I hope you know what you are doing.	Ngethemba ukuthi uyazi ukuthi wenzani.
This is my question.	Umbuzo wami lo.
None of us know what he did.	Akekho kithi owaziyo ukuthi enzeni.
It seems really hard.	Kubonakala kunzima ngempela.
But he really isn't.	Kodwa akekho ngempela.
I live here.	Ngihlala lapha.
Travel is good.	Ukuhamba kuhle.
So, good job.	Ngakho, umsebenzi omuhle.
That is not our job.	Akuwona umsebenzi wethu lowo.
It's too late.	Sekwephuzile.
He opened the door.	Wavula umnyango.
But the story is not about that.	Kodwa indaba ayikho ngalokho.
He was not a bad person at all.	Wayengeyena umuntu omubi ngempela.
It is good to know that.	Kuhle ukwazi lokho.
That's a good word.	Izwi elihle lelo.
You do not need to do anything.	Awudingi ukwenza lutho.
It can be really helpful.	Kungaba usizo ngempela.
He said he knew nothing.	Wathi akazi lutho.
He knew he had done it.	Wayazi ukuthi ukwenzile.
But she did not think so.	Kodwa akazange acabange kanjalo.
His career began.	Umsebenzi wakhe waqala.
What is his name.	Ubani igama lakhe.
I probably didn't want to know.	Cishe ngangingafuni ukwazi.
I had to find out who he was.	Bekumele ngithole ukuthi ubani.
Need to say more ?.	Udinga ukusho okwengeziwe?.
I didn't say anything, of course.	Angizange ngisho lutho, kunjalo.
Very, very much.	Kakhulu, ngisho.
Do you know that.	Ingabe uyakwazi lokho.
I've never been here.	Angikaze ngibe lapha.
You just love it.	Uthanda nje.
One tomorrow.	Omunye kusasa.
He didn't know if he would be able to do it.	Wayengazi noma uzokwazi yini ukwenza.
He didn't go very far.	Akazange ahambe kakhulu.
But not with him.	Kodwa hhayi naye.
He says it's time.	Uthi sekuyisikhathi.
He will not come to you.	Ngeke eze kuwe.
That's the mother.	Umama lowo.
Yes it can.	Yebo kungaba njalo.
I think you should have been there.	Ngicabanga ukuthi bekufanele ngabe ukhona.
It means nothing at all.	Akusho lutho kancane.
He spoke in class.	Wakhuluma ekilasini.
Everything will be.	Konke kuzoba .
No one wants to hear that.	Akekho ofuna ukuzwa lokho.
We have to do this.	Kufanele sikwenze lokhu.
Maybe you mean something.	Mhlawumbe usho okuthile.
At least, to me.	Okungenani, kimi.
Is this possible.	Kungenzeka yini lokhu.
It is not really my decision.	Akusona isinqumo sami ngempela.
Maybe that would be much better.	Mhlawumbe lokho kungaba ngcono kakhulu.
You never know why.	Ngeke wazi ukuthi kungani.
He did just fine by himself.	Wenza kahle nje yedwa.
Nothing to do now.	Akukho okumele kwenziwe manje.
You must go again.	Kumele ukuthi uhambe futhi.
Only he did not of course.	Kuphela akazange Yebo.
Taller, but not better.	Mude, kodwa hhayi kangcono.
That's a very good question.	Umbuzo omuhle kakhulu lowo.
Certainly, he says.	Impela, usho.
Time for me to go.	Isikhathi sokuthi ngihambe.
But you know what happens.	Kodwa uyazi ukuthi kwenzekani.
Just like we did this morning.	Njengoba nje senze namhlanje ekuseni.
Maybe you are wrong.	Mhlawumbe unephutha.
He saw his mother.	Wabona umama wakhe.
I came a little bit.	Ngize kancane.
I asked and he agreed.	Ngabuza wavuma.
I didn't really.	Angizange ngempela.
I want you to be my girlfriend.	Ngifuna ube intombi yami.
Tomorrow is possible, but also probably not.	Kusasa kungenzeka, kodwa futhi mhlawumbe akunjalo.
Doing this a few times will make it easier.	Ukwenza lokhu izikhathi ezimbalwa kuzoba lula.
But this is not your time.	Kodwa lesi akusona isikhathi sakho.
That family is good.	Muhle umndeni lowo.
You should eat less!	Kufanele udle kancane!
I just thought you should know.	Ngicabange nje ukuthi kufanele wazi.
I can’t imagine why he wanted this.	Angikwazi ukucabanga ukuthi kungani efuna lokhu.
But that is not the time when it happened.	Kodwa akusona isikhathi lapho kwenzeka.
I'll be there for at least a week.	Ngizoba lapho isonto okungenani.
He had to be where he was.	Kwakufanele abe kuphi.
He said a little to me.	Wathi kancane kimi.
He can't do that.	Angeke akwenze lokho.
He wants to get married, but he does not know how.	Uyafuna ukushada, kodwa akazi ukuthi kanjani.
Well, he did.	Kulungile, wakwenza.
At first, nothing.	Ekuqaleni, lutho.
I don't want to be you either.	Nami angifuni ukuba nguwe.
It's better.	Kungcono.
He told everyone what had happened.	Watshela wonke umuntu okwenzekile.
And I'm very happy about it.	Futhi ngijabule kakhulu ngakho.
I do not know about this.	Angazi ngalokhu.
I would love to hear more about that.	Ngingathanda ukuzwa okwengeziwe ngalokho.
There is something really good about that.	Kukhona into enhle ngempela ngalokho.
You do not want to work there anyway.	Awufuni ukusebenza lapho noma kunjalo.
So only me.	Ngakho mina kuphela.
From the end.	Kusukela ekugcineni.
He sat next to me.	Wahlala eduze kwami.
It's hard, to tell the truth.	Kunzima, ukukhuluma iqiniso.
I know what my problem is.	Ngiyazi ukuthi yini inkinga yami.
For the better, obviously.	Ukuze kube ngcono, kusobala.
That is very difficult for us.	Kunzima ngempela lokho kithi.
You learn from him.	Ufunda kuye.
Now, another thing.	Manje, enye into.
Not immediately.	Hhayi ngokushesha.
There is nothing here for me now.	Akukho lutho lapha kimi manje.

But only a few days.	Kodwa kuphela izinsuku ezimbalwa.
I know you very well.	Ngikwazi kahle kakhulu.
It has to be made to happen.	Kufanele kwenziwe ukuthi kwenzeke.

It's me again.	Yimina futhi.
He says he wants a job.	Uthi ufuna umsebenzi.
Before we left.	Ngaphambi kokuba sihambe.
I would like to see that.	Ngingathanda ukubona lokho.
He will not come to you.	Angeke afike kuwe.

He just walked in.	Wangena nje.
But he said it would not happen.	Kodwa wathi ngeke kwenzeke.

Why does everyone do such a great thing?	Kungani wonke umuntu enza into enkulu kangaka ngakho?
So he sat back, alone.	Ngakho wahlala ngemuva, yedwa.
Certainly not.	Ngeke neze.
He finally opened the door and went inside.	Ekugcineni wavula umnyango wangena.
He wanted to know, he had to know.	Wayefuna ukwazi, kwadingeka azi.
Sounds at least in high school.	Kuzwakala okungenani esikoleni esiphakeme.
I tried to approach him.	Ngazama ukuya kuye.
Ultimately, someone has to make a decision.	Ekugcineni, othile kufanele enze isinqumo.
Now he heard everything.	Manje wezwa yonke into.
Too much.	Kakhulu kakhulu.
He decided to take the bus home.	Wanquma ukugibela ibhasi aye ekhaya.
But he was surprised.	Kodwa wamangala.

Another place is food.	Enye indawo ukudla.

Gradually he found it difficult to stay with her.	Kancane kancane waba nzima ukuhlala naye.
He comes and goes.	Afike ahambe.
Getting out.	Ukuphuma.
We make evil happen.	Senza okubi kwenzeke.
He just doesn't like to hear about it.	Akathandi nje ukuzwa ngayo.
However, no one is around.	Noma kunjalo, akekho eduze.
He wouldn't be.	Ubengeke abe.
There is no right answer.	Ayikho impendulo efanele.

Thanks again, for everything.	Ngiyabonga futhi, ngakho konke.
System.	Uhlelo.
He's just sitting.	Uhlezi nje.
It's not money.	Akuyona imali.
Everyone talks about it and no one does anything about it.	Wonke umuntu ukhuluma ngakho futhi akekho owenza lutho ngakho.
It should have been so.	Bekufanele kube njalo.
I'm only telling the truth.	Ngikhuluma iqiniso kuphela.
Staying with us.	Ukuhlala nathi.

Just to help.	Ukusiza nje.
You will be beautiful enough for a while now.	Uzoba muhle ngokwanele isikhashana manje.
But this time he returned home.	Kodwa ngalesi sikhathi wabuyela ekhaya.

Yes, just a few things.	Yebo, izinto ezimbalwa nje.
As it would be easy.	Njengoba kungaba lula.
In the morning.	Ekuseni.
You will arrive on time.	Uzofika ngesikhathi.
It's the right thing to do.	Yinto efanele ukuyenza.
Trying to do too much.	Ukuzama ukwenza okuningi kakhulu.
Now imagine that that really happened.	Manje ake ucabange ukuthi lokho kwenzeka ngempela.
Everywhere it happens.	Yonke indawo kwenzeka.
You do not know what he did.	Awazi ukuthi wenzeni.
He goes there.	Uhamba lapho.

You wouldn't have it.	Ubungeke ube nakho.
Because you live outside.	Ngoba uhlala ngaphandle.
I know what's good now.	Ngiyazi ukuthi yini enhle manje.
And that is not the same thing.	Futhi lokho akuyona into efanayo.
No one knows what to do.	Akekho owaziyo ukuthi enzeni.
I sometimes think you may be asleep.	Ngike ngicabange ukuthi kungenzeka ulele.
I would like to see the whole room.	Ngingathanda ukubona lonke igumbi.
So much is happening.	Kuningi kakhulu okwenzekayo.

He was not a great man.	Wayengeyena umuntu omkhulu.
But that is not our job.	Kodwa lokho akuwona umsebenzi wethu.
Is that so? 	Ingabe kunjalo?
He wondered if all of that was true.	Wazibuza ukuthi ngabe kuyiqiniso yini konke lokho.
But maybe he did.	Kodwa mhlawumbe wakwenza.
Apparently, the boy did not want to leave.	Ngokusobala, umfana wayengafuni ukuhamba.
And in fact, there is so much more.	Futhi empeleni, kuningi kakhulu.
But one should not dwell on that for long.	Kodwa umuntu akufanele ahlale kulokho isikhathi eside.
Always, always, always.	Njalo, njalo, njalo.
But it is difficult.	Kodwa kunzima.
He will not go away.	Angeke ahambe.
At first, he cannot continue, he does not want to continue.	Ekuqaleni, akakwazi ukuqhubeka, akafuni ukuqhubeka.
He heard his voice at night.	Wezwa izwi lakhe ebusuku.
He just doesn't know.	Akazi nje.
He must return tomorrow.	Kumele abuye kusasa.

Not college.	Hhayi ekolishi.
He came to my house today.	Ufike kwami ​​namuhla.

There is no fix for this problem.	Akukho ukulungisa le nkinga.
Instead, he knew that he needed to talk.	Kunalokho, wayazi ukuthi kufanele akhulume.

That doesn't matter how you dress.	Ukuthi akusho lutho ukuthi ugqoke kanjani.
I know you're scared.	Ngiyazi ukuthi uyesaba.
He can't think of anything about it.	Ngeke acabange lutho ngakho.
He is just a father.	Ubaba nje.
Allow me.	Ngivumele.

I couldn't think of it.	Angikwazanga ukucabanga ngakho.
He said he had never told anyone.	Wathi akakaze atshele muntu.
I don't really know how to do this.	Angazi ngempela ukuthi ngingakwenza kanjani lokhu.
Outside, it is not.	Ngaphandle, akunjalo.
We will not leave tonight, or tomorrow.	Ngeke sihambe namuhla ebusuku, noma kusasa.

I'm amazed at him.	Ngiyamangala ngaye.
Is this good.	Ingabe lokhu kuhle.
He can know what to do with it.	Angakwazi ukuthi enzeni ngakho.

And indeed that seems right.	Futhi ngempela lokho kubonakala kulungile.
You want another baby, and that's it.	Ufuna enye ingane, futhi yilokho.
He will come anytime now.	Uzofika noma nini manje.
That’s it, and my only problem with this issue.	Leyo nto, futhi inkinga yami kuphela ngale ndaba.
I want you just around the corner.	Ngifuna wena eduze nje.
I have to do more.	Kufanele ngenze okwengeziwe.
But it really is not a big deal.	Kodwa empeleni akuyona into enkulu.
He retired a little.	Wathatha umhlalaphansi kancane.
I know nothing about this.	Angazi lutho ngalokhu.
Not a bad idea.	Akuwona umqondo omubi.
No, nothing yet.	Cha, akukho lutho okwamanje.
Everyone knows it by now.	Wonke umuntu uyazi okwamanje.
I did not want to talk.	Ngangingafuni ukukhuluma.
Maybe he did not think so.	Mhlawumbe akazange acabange kanjalo.
I want to learn from you.	Ngifuna ukufunda kuwe.
What to do.	Okufanele ukwenze.
I don't think he did.	Angicabangi ukuthi wakwenza.
I'm sure you won't.	Ngiqinisekile ngeke.
Weeks, or maybe months to fix.	Amasonto, noma mhlawumbe izinyanga ukulungisa.
You were not there.	Awuzange ube khona.
He’s here, though, not for long.	Ulapha, kodwa, hhayi isikhathi eside.
No one should stop that for me.	Akekho okufanele ayeke lokho ngenxa yami.
So he has to do it.	Ngakho kufanele akwenze.
I'm sure he wouldn't make a mistake.	Nginesiqiniseko sokuthi ubengeke enze iphutha.
But he was not and did not.	Kodwa wayengekho futhi akazange.
Yes, yes, that should be the case.	Yebo, yebo, kufanele kube yilokho.
As you want.	Njengoba ufuna.
And he looked easy.	Futhi wayebukeka kalula.
That is true enough.	Lokho kuyiqiniso ngokwanele.
Surely something had to happen.	Impela bekumele kwenzeke okuthile.
Maybe there is no right way.	Mhlawumbe ayikho indlela okufanele.
I wanted it to be better.	Bengifuna ukuthi kube ngcono.
there must be something else going on.	kufanele kube kukhona okunye okwenzekayo.
You have done that before.	Uke wakwenza lokho ngaphambilini.
I wonder how long it has been there.	Kazi sekunesikhathi esingakanani lapho.
You know, it doesn't have to be this way.	Uyazi, akufanele kube ngale ndlela.
I don't have much money.	Anginayo imali eningi.
They did not know.	Bengazi.
And it can be anything.	Futhi kungaba noma yini.
But even this did not happen.	Kodwa ngisho nalokhu akuzange kwenzeke.
He came home happy.	Wafika ekhaya ejabule.
I need to adjust my health.	Ngidinga ukulungisa impilo yami.
I think it will be soon.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kuzoba maduze.
So off he went.	Ngakho wahamba.
I don't know what happened to me.	Angazi ukuthi kwenzekani ngami.
He looks young.	Ubukeka esemncane.
He wanted to live.	Wayefuna ukuphila.
Maybe you're here.	Mhlawumbe ulapha.
But he did not know why.	Kodwa wayengazi ukuthi kungani.
That's not a good way to do it.	Leyo akuyona indlela enhle yokwenza.
He will not come to my office.	Ngeke eze ehhovisi lami.
And for now.	Futhi okwamanje.
John attended the meeting.	UJohn waya emhlanganweni.
So apparently, he said.	Ngakho kubonakala, wathi.
I couldn’t really take that long.	Angikwazanga ngempela ukuthatha isikhathi eside kangaka.
It happens a lot too.	Kwenzeka kakhulu futhi.
So much for that.	Kakhulu ngalokho.
But that is exactly what it is.	Kodwa kunjalo impela.
He has never and never will.	Akakaze futhi akasoze.
I said he would go.	Bengithi uzohamba.
This is not the case at all.	Lokhu akunjalo neze.
I did not speak to him.	Angizange ngikhulume naye.
Even so.	Ngisho kunjalo.
He must leave immediately.	Kumele ahambe ngaso leso sikhathi.
Even small.	Ngisho encane.
In between.	Phakathi.
I am not sure if that is possible.	Anginaso isiqiniseko sokuthi lokho kungenzeka yini.
I need to learn more.	Ngidinga ukufunda okwengeziwe.
Music.	Umculo.
No, he could not speak yet.	Cha, akakwazanga ukukhuluma okwamanje.
All this.	Konke lokhu .
This is not a really good idea.	Lokhu akuwona umqondo omuhle ngempela.
I know there is no choice.	Ngiyazi akukho ukukhetha.
He wanted to go home, but he was afraid of his friend.	Wayefuna ukuya ekhaya, kodwa wayesaba umngane wakhe.
He thought about how to do it right.	Wacabanga ukuthi ungakwenza kanjani kahle.
His life, our life.	Impilo yakhe, impilo yethu.
What is your problem? 	Yini inkinga yakho?
Maybe next year.	Mhlawumbe ngonyaka ozayo.
I always say.	Ngisho njalo.
You would not walk behind me.	Ubungeke uhambe ngemuva kwami.
Finally, he did.	Ekugcineni, wakwenza.
We have to find another way.	Kufanele sithole enye indlela.
But not in this case.	Kodwa hhayi kulokhu.
Tell me why.	Ungitshele ukuthi kungani.
That is the key to our success.	Lowo ukhiye omkhulu wethu.

That is why this happened.	Yingakho lokhu kwenzeka.
Or maybe.	Noma mhlawumbe.

I will not do it.	Ngeke ngikwenze.
He was not at home.	Wayengekho ekhaya.
It needs to be done in my office.	Kudingeka kwenziwe ehhovisi lami.
But that is what happened here.	Kodwa yilokho okwenzeka lapha.
Yeah, yeah, that's pretty cool.	Yebo, yebo, lokho kuhle kakhulu.
I know everything.	Ngazi konke.

He could do better than that.	Angenza kangcono kunalokho.
Actually a lot.	Empeleni kuningi.
At least, not immediately.	Okungenani, hhayi ngokushesha.
With him.	Naye.
I wanted someone else to know.	Bengifuna omunye umuntu azi.
My plan is not a plan.	Icebo lami akulona uhlelo.
But he did not speak.	Kodwa akazange akhulume.
I hope you come back.	Ngethemba ukuthi uzobuya.
Now, he thought.	Manje, wacabanga.

It should not happen this way.	Akufanele kwenzeke ngale ndlela.
And he never was.	Futhi akazange abe.
He wanted to leave immediately.	Wayefuna ukuhamba ngokushesha.
The family thought it would be good for him.	Umndeni wacabanga ukuthi kungaba kuhle kuye.
The teacher is beautiful.	Uthisha muhle.
But he could not sleep.	Kodwa akakwazanga ukulala.
She just wanted the boy to go.	Wayefuna nje ukuthi umfana ahambe.
What that could be, he did not know.	Ukuthi kungaba yini lokho, wayengazi.
We have to make it happen.	Kufanele sikwenze kwenzeke.
I wouldn’t get anything else from him.	Bengingeke ngithole enye into kuye.
That is the only answer.	Yilokho kuphela impendulo.
He did not think so.	Wayengacabangi kanjalo.
Everyone goes here.	Wonke umuntu uhamba lapha.

In fact, that may not be necessary.	Empeleni, lokho kungase kungadingeki.
I don't know if it's possible.	Angazi noma kungenzeka yini.
Me, too.	Nami, futhi.
But this is our mother.	Kodwa umama wethu lo.

It was clear that there was.	Kwacaca ukuthi kukhona.
Something needs to be done.	Kudingeka kwenziwe okuthile.

He should have known.	Bekufanele azi.
Hopefully you will be back soon !.	Ngethemba uzobuya maduze!.
But that is not here and it is not there.	Kodwa lokho akukho lapha futhi akukho lapho.
Someone had to.	Kwadingeka othile.

Everything is possible.	Konke kungenzeka.
I will be his father.	Ngizoba ubaba wakhe.
You only have to do it once.	Kufanele ukwenze kanye kuphela.
And he did not know how he felt.	Futhi wayengazi ukuthi uzizwa kanjani.
Nice to hear your voice !.	Ngijabule ukuzwa izwi lakho!.
He did very well in his work.	Wenza kahle impela emsebenzini wakhe.

You know you won't.	Uyazi ngeke.
He wanted very much.	Wayefuna kakhulu.
Slowly he began to speak.	Kancane kancane waqala ukukhuluma.
He also refused.	Naye wenqaba.
Not a bad time.	Hhayi isikhathi esibi.
It will not be so easy.	Ngeke kube lula kanjalo.
Someone made a mistake.	Othile wenze iphutha.
I did not know until today.	Bengingazi kuze kube namuhla.
My mother also started to cry.	Umama naye waqala ukukhala kabi.
I made it easy for him.	Ngenze kube lula kuye.
Not so much, I mean, he thought.	Hhayi kakhulu, ngisho, wacabanga.
There is no one here.	Akukho muntu lapha.
You do not want to know why someone is doing something.	Awufuni ukwazi ukuthi kungani umuntu enze okuthile.
As you say.	Njengoba usho.
But the truth is.	Kodwa iqiniso.
Everyone is happy about it.	Wonke umuntu uyajabula ngakho.

But he is not a man yet.	Kodwa akayena umuntu okwamanje.
I want you to be better than me.	Ngifuna ube ngcono kunami.
And do things.	Futhi wenze izinto.
The whole system.	Uhlelo lonke.

We have done the same.	Nathi senze njalo.
It's me.	Yimi.
You can, but not me.	Ungakwazi, kodwa hhayi mina.
This is another way.	Lena enye indlela.
I don't know how true that is.	Angazi ukuthi kuyiqiniso kangakanani lokho.
Well okay.	Kulungile kulungile.
That has become clear from the start.	Lokho kuye kwacaca kusukela ekuqaleni.
It just has to be you.	Kufanele kube uwena nje.
His eyes	Amehlo akhe
That is what your father would like.	Yilokho ubaba wakho angathanda.
I will not know tomorrow.	Ngeke ngikwazi kusasa.
Your gun.	Isibhamu sakho.
But it is very difficult to do.	Kodwa kunzima kakhulu ukwenza.
Thank you for your time.	Ngiyabonga ngesikhathi sakho.
I want to continue with it.	Ngifuna ukuqhubeka nakho.

In fact, my father is not with her.	Empeleni ubaba akekho naye.
About your age, maybe.	Cishe ngeminyaka yakho, mhlawumbe.
Worse than that.	Okubi kakhulu kunalokho.

If you want to give it a try, that's fine.	Uma ufuna ukuzama, kulungile.
I would really like him to come back.	Ngingathanda ngempela ukuthi abuye.
But it is very difficult to read.	Kodwa kunzima kakhulu ukufunda.
He does everything right.	Wenza konke ngendlela efanele.
You don't have to do it, but you can't help it.	Akufanele ukwenze, kodwa awukwazi ukukusiza.
It hurts a lot.	Ubuhlungu kakhulu.
He came alone.	Weza yedwa.
He needs your help.	Udinga usizo lwakho.
And so.	Futhi ngakho.
He was wearing a hat at the time.	Wayegqoke isigqoko ngaleso sikhathi.
That doesn't mean it doesn't.	Lokho akusho ukuthi ayikho.
But it should not.	Kodwa akufanele.
He has no place to make a mistake.	Akanayo indawo yokwenza iphutha.
You know where you live.	Uyazi lapho uhlala khona.
He stayed there all day.	Wahlala lapho usuku lonke.
At least not immediately.	Okungenani hhayi ngokushesha.
I want to hear it all.	Ngifuna ukuzwa konke.
But do not overdo it.	Kodwa ungabi mude.
Or rather, he talked a lot.	Noma kunalokho, wakhuluma kakhulu.
She is as happy as she can be.	Ujabule ngangokunokwenzeka.
He could not stop.	Akakwazanga ukuyeka.
Fast and high.	Ngokushesha futhi phezulu.
There is a truth about you.	Kukhona iqiniso ngawe.
He also did not know what to do.	Naye wayengazi ukuthi enzeni.
And he couldn't.	Futhi akakwazanga.
And he loves to travel.	Futhi uthanda ukuhamba.
And not just any outfit.	Futhi hhayi nje noma iyiphi ingubo.
Yes, that's what happened.	Yebo, yilokho okwenzekile.
But he found that he had to win.	Kodwa wathola ukuthi kwakudingeka awine.
It seems so, though.	Kubonakala kanjalo, noma kunjalo.
He also wants to get a cat.	Naye ufuna ukuthola ikati.
And sometimes, that is true.	Futhi ngezinye izikhathi, lokho kuyiqiniso.
Stop talking! 	Yeka ukukhuluma!
I can't tell you much.	Angikwazi ukukutshela okuningi.
I only did the work.	Ngenze umsebenzi kuphela.

It happens every day now.	Kwenzeka zonke izinsuku manje.
I want to find out who did this.	Ngifuna ukuthola ukuthi ubani owenze lokhu.
Good as it is.	Kuhle njengoba kunjalo.
It can be once a year.	Kungaba kanye ngonyaka.
He knew he wouldn't do that.	Wayazi ukuthi wayengeke akwenze lokho.
She wants to buy a dress.	Ufuna ukuthenga ingubo.
Lots of driving.	Ukushayela okuningi.
But he didn't, he couldn't.	Kodwa akazange, akakwazanga.
Okay, and maybe a little longer.	Kulungile, futhi mhlawumbe mude kancane.

You do not need help.	Awufuni usizo.

Here without you.	Ngilapha nawe.
Maybe just mom.	Mhlawumbe umama kuphela.
Day.	Usuku.
Not a big problem then.	Akuyona inkinga enkulu uma kunjalo.

This is not but playing hard here.	Lokhu akuwona kodwa ukudlala kanzima lapha.
He wasn't so sure about her.	Wayengenaso isiqiniseko kangako ngaye.
And so do you.	Futhi kanjalo nawe.
You do not need to be tested.	Awudingi ukuhlolwa.
I saw something now.	Ngabona okuthile manje.

He refused to eat his supper.	Wenqaba ukudla isidlo sakhe sakusihlwa.
I know how that sounds.	Ngiyazi ukuthi kuzwakala kanjani lokho.
That was necessary.	Lokho kwakudingeka.
I hope we don't.	Ngethemba ukuthi ngeke sibe njalo.
My mother never got better.	Umama akazange abe ngcono.
Now you can do that.	Manje ungakwenza lokho.
A lot really.	Kuningi ngempela.
Work time.	Umsebenzi isikhathi.
I had to talk to him.	Kwadingeka ngikhulume naye.
No one deserves it.	Akekho okufanele.
He can be with you this afternoon.	Angaba nawe ntambama.
There is no reason why it should.	Asikho isizathu sokuthi kungani kufanele.
Let me do it.	Ngivumele ngikwenze.
We have to do something, and soon!	Kufanele senze okuthile, futhi ngokushesha!
Cars	Imoto

And he doesn't know anything now.	Futhi akazi lutho manje.
You feel like you are doing something to help.	Uzizwa sengathi wenza okuthile ukusiza.
Many years ago now.	Eminyakeni eminingi edlule manje.

He is sleeping.	Ulele yena.
But she could not cry.	Kodwa akakwazanga ukukhala.
But no one does it all.	Kodwa akekho owenza konke.
I did not.	Angizange.
So let's make it easy.	Ngakho ake sikwenze kube lula.
To get better now.	Ukuze ube ngcono njengamanje.
And maybe too much.	Futhi mhlawumbe okuningi kakhulu.
He took another one and went with him.	Wathatha omunye wahamba naye.
But obviously, that is not true.	Kodwa ngokusobala, akulona iqiniso.
This is not his way.	Lena akuyona indlela yakhe.
You have reached a new place.	Ufike endaweni entsha.
First, it will not be the first.	Okokuqala, ngeke kube okokuqala.
So it will not be in that. 	Ngakho ngeke kube kulokho. 
He wanted me to stay.	Wayefuna ngihlale.
You want to take your time.	Ufuna ukuthatha isikhathi sakho.
To you, it is quite obvious.	Kuwe, kusobala ngokuphelele.
He sat with us, walked with us, talking with us.	Wahlala nathi, wahamba nathi, ekhuluma nathi.
The boy did not learn to read.	Umfana akazange afunde ukufunda.
Since last year.	Kusukela ngonyaka odlule.
We went well.	Sihambe kahle.
She is scared to death.	Uyesaba ukufa.
My question is.	Umbuzo wami uthi.
We probably should go.	Cishe kufanele sihambe.
But he could not do it himself.	Kodwa akakwazanga ukukwenza yena.
In this case, you are wrong.	Kulokhu, unephutha.
You do not want to waste your time with me.	Awufuni ukuchitha isikhathi sakho nami.
I have never done so big before.	Angikaze ngenze enkulu kangaka ngaphambili.
I don’t have it and I won’t.	Anginayo futhi ngeke.
And he knew.	Futhi wayazi.
But no, it is not.	Kodwa cha, akunjalo.

Nothing, nothing.	Lutho, lutho.
I could not eat right now	Angikwazanga ukudla njengamanje
By this, as.	Ngalokhu, njengoba.
But this.	Kodwa lokhu.
That doesn't mean it's not true.	Lokho akusho ukuthi akulona iqiniso.
Do you really think so.	Ngabe ucabanga kanjalo ngempela.
I need to see you now	Ngidinga ukukubona manje
I don't know if it will be so.	Angazi noma kuzoba njalo.
I just wanted to do a good job.	Bengifuna nje ukwenza umsebenzi omuhle.
I want to say something to her	Ngifuna ukusho okuthile kuye
I want to stay here for a while	Ngifuna ukuhlala lapha isikhashana
Maybe he just wanted to get things done.	Mhlawumbe wayefuna ukuqeda izinto.
You will never know what happened.	Ngeke wazi ukuthi ngabe kwenzekeni.
He did not know who he was.	Akazange akwazi ukuthi ufana nobani.
I need you to stay with me.	Ngidinga ukuthi uhlale nami.
He wanted more.	Wayefuna okwengeziwe.
It's okay to make a mistake.	Kulungile ukwenza iphutha.
That is true for me.	Kuyiqiniso lokho kimi.
I couldn’t get into myself fast enough.	Angikwazanga ukungena kimi ngokushesha ngokwanele.
I want to make absolutely sure.	Ngifuna ukwenza isiqiniseko ngokuphelele.
But there is really another way.	Kodwa kukhona ngempela enye indlela.
He looked out the door.	Wabheka ngaphandle emnyango.
Life, of course.	Impilo, kunjalo.
I got a beer.	Ngithole ubhiya.
I did well with it	Ngenze kahle ngayo
I saw through him.	Ngabona ngaye.
I'm not really sure what to do.	Angiqiniseki ngempela ukuthi ngenzeni.
There is so much to do.	Kuningi okumele ukwenze.
You do not have to.	Akudingekile ukuba wenze njalo.
You will have to do something about it.	Kuzodingeka wenze okuthile ngakho.
Just something, maybe.	Into nje, mhlawumbe.
I knew he wanted to come	Ngangazi ukuthi wayefuna ukuza
She would like to help.	Angathanda ukusiza.
Or, you should.	Noma, kufanele.
I can no longer wait to quit this job	Angisakwazi ukulinda ukuyeka lo msebenzi
I need to get out with all this	Ngidinga ukuphuma nakho konke lokhu
i want what it is not	ngifuna lokho akukhona
This is not perhaps, this is true.	Lokhu akuwona mhlawumbe, lokhu kuyiqiniso.
I did not want to work	Ngangingafuni ukusebenza
I didn't even know he was there	Bengingazi nokuthi ukhona
I wanted it to be a question	Bengifuna kube umbuzo
I thought for a moment	Ngacabanga isikhashana
It's hard to see that.	Kunzima ukubona leyo nto.
I can't take something like that	Angikwazi ukuthatha into enjalo
There will be no questions.	Ngeke kube khona imibuzo.
I could not do it myself	Angikwazanga ukuzenza
He would never do that again.	Wayengeke aphinde akwenze lokho.
Akayena.	Akayena .
I did not know what he meant	Ngangingazi ukuthi usho ukuthini
It looks okay	Kubukeka kulungile
What on earth could it be ?.	Kungaba yini emhlabeni?.
Not until now.	Hhayi kuze kube manje.
And so, really, really.	Futhi kunjalo, ngempela, kunjalo.
That's all right.	Impela kulungile.
And so it seems to us.	Futhi ngakho kubonakala ngathi.
Maybe you shouldn’t drink.	Mhlawumbe akufanele ukuphuza.
He always does what is right for everyone.	Uhlala wenza okufanele wonke umuntu.
Well always.	Kahle njalo.
I can no longer think of him right now	Angisakwazi ukucabanga ngaye njengamanje
I went.	Ngiye.
He wouldn't do it now.	Wayengeke akwenze manje.
He did not have to speak.	Kwakungadingeki ukuthi akhulume.
I'm going with her tonight	Ngizohamba naye namhlanje ebusuku
He died a few years later.	Washona eminyakeni embalwa kamuva.
You simply can't.	Kalula nje awukwazi.
I knew when he said	Ngangazi ukuthi usho nini
I would really like that	Ngingathanda ngempela lokho
But you want power.	Kodwa ufuna amandla.
A few days, at least three	Izinsuku ezimbalwa, okungenani ezintathu
I never thought of him this way	Angizange ngicabange ngaye ngale ndlela
I'm not a bad person here	Angiyena umuntu omubi lapha
And it happened many times.	Futhi kwenzeka kaningi.
Thank you very much	Ngiyabonga ngempela
I have been thinking for some time	Sekunesikhathi ngicabanga
I knew exactly what to do	Ngangazi kahle ukuthi yini okufanele ngiyenze
At that time he was young.	Ngaleso sikhathi esemncane.
To help you.	Ukukusiza.
No problem yet.	Ayikho inkinga okwamanje.
And you are the key.	Futhi nguwe ukhiye.
Life.	Ukuphila.
I want to be a doctor	Ngifuna ukuba udokotela
Still, something had to be done.	Noma kunjalo, kwadingeka kwenziwe okuthile.
I did it very quickly.	Ngikwenze ngokushesha kakhulu.

I mean, someone had to do it.	Ngisho, othile kwakufanele akwenze.

I'm so scared	Ngesaba kakhulu
I couldn't do anything about it	Angikwazanga ukwenza lutho ngakho
I never thought it would be possible	Ngangingacabangi ukuthi kungenzeka
I need to choose only one	Ngidinga ukukhetha eyodwa kuphela
I just want my mom to be my mom too	Ngifisa nje umama kube umama wami futhi
He is not a boy.	Akuyena umfana.
I'm not sure the name.	Angiqiniseki igama.
I just can't talk to her right now	Angikwazi nje ukukhuluma naye njengamanje
I wish you were here with me	Ngifisa sengathi ngabe ulapha nami
I think of you and your family all the time.	Ngicabanga ngawe nomndeni wakho njalo.
I really wanted to go	Ngangifuna ngempela ukuhamba
I just want to help you	Ngifuna nje ukukusiza
I don't think that should be done.	Angicabangi ukuthi kufanele kwenziwe lokho.
Tell me about it again.	Ngitshele ngakho futhi.
I know exactly how you feel, he thought	Ngazi kahle ukuthi uzizwa kanjani, wacabanga
That would be nice, too.	Lokho kungaba kuhle, futhi.
But he does not think so.	Kodwa akacabangi kanjalo.
I have to be	Kufanele ngibe njalo
Maybe just for a whole week.	Mhlawumbe noma nje isonto lonke.
I think he would like to	Ngicabanga ukuthi angathanda
I should have thought it would be so.	Bekufanele ngicabange ukuthi kuzoba njalo.
He too looked surprised.	Naye wayebukeka emangele.
I mean, in fact, you've gone too far in this	Ngisho ukuthi, empeleni, uhambe kakhulu kulokhu
I wanted to see his eyes	Ngangifuna ukubona amehlo akhe
I'm pretty sure	Ngiyaqiniseka impela
I wanted to try to do something else	Bengifuna ukuzama ukwenza enye into
If.	Ukuba.
I tried to eat a book	Ngazama ukudla incwadi

Well done though.	Wenze kahle kodwa.
I'm not entirely sure	Angiqiniseki ngokuphelele

All right, too.	Kulungile, futhi.
I wanted many things at once	Ngangifuna izinto eziningi ngesikhathi esisodwa

I wanted to get out of there	Bengifuna ukuphuma lapho
I'm so happy for you both	Ngijabule kakhulu ngani nobabili
At least, not me and you.	Okungenani, hhayi mina nawe.
I would not, of course	Bengingeke, kunjalo

He knew there.	Wayazi lapho.
I don't know how long it will take.	Angazi ukuthi kuzothatha isikhathi esingakanani.
No one else is bad.	Akekho omunye umuntu omubi.
I would not be able to sleep there	Bengingeke ngikwazi ukulala lapho
You will not have to do much.	Ngeke kudingeke wenze okuningi.
I have to go to work soon	Kumele ngiye emsebenzini maduze
A message came out.	Waphuma umlayezo.
I'm sure you've thought about it.	Ngiqinisekile ukuthi uke wacabanga ngakho.
Of course not.	Yebo akunjalo.
I can't do that on this one.	Angikwazi ukwenza lokho kulokhu.
You have to dress appropriately.	Kufanele ugqoke ngendlela efanele.
Not without me.	Hhayi ngaphandle kwami.
I mean we can't be alone	Ngisho ukuthi ngeke sibe sodwa
But not with you, either, not with you at all.	Kodwa hhayi nawe, noma, hhayi nawe ngokuphelele.
I want to go home, he thought.	Ngifuna ukuya ekhaya, wacabanga.

As you can imagine.	Njengoba ucabange.
But we need your help.	Kodwa sidinga usizo lwakho.
I'm sorry, if it happens	Ngiyaxolisa, uma kwenzeka

I want to talk about us	Ngifuna ukukhuluma ngathi
I asked what he meant	Ngabuza ukuthi usho ukuthini
No need.	Asikho isidingo.
Indeed, only one.	Ngempela, eyodwa kuphela.
I think we need only one	Ngicabanga ukuthi sidinga eyodwa kuphela
Because you just can't.	Ngoba awukwazi nje.
Let me express my opinion.	Ngivumele ngikhulume umqondo wami.
I'm so sorry for all that	Ngiyaxolisa kakhulu ngakho konke lokho
I didn't know what to do with it	Ngangingazi ukuthi ngenzeni ngakho
Now don't forget to do your homework.	Manje ungakhohlwa ukwenza umsebenzi wakho wesikole.
He has never done anything to you.	Akakaze enze lutho kuwe.
I want to talk to her first	Ngifuna ukukhuluma naye kuqala
Or too to me.	Noma kakhulu kimi.
I don't think that's true	Angicabangi ukuthi kuyiqiniso lelo
I did not think of this in advance	Angizange ngicabange lokhu kusenesikhathi
It may be helpful.	Kungase kube usizo.
Not too late, not too early.	Hhayi sekwephuzile kakhulu, hhayi ekuseni kakhulu.
Reading is not true.	Ukufunda akulona iqiniso.
I think you know that	Ngicabanga ukuthi uyakwazi lokho
He has to go.	Kufanele ahambe.
Yes and no.	Kunjalo futhi akunjalo.
I mean, hopefully.	Ngisho, ngethemba.
I couldn't be with him	Angikwazanga ukuba naye
He thought for a very long time.	Wacabanga isikhathi eside kakhulu.
I knew what was coming then.	Ngangazi ukuthi yini ezayo ngaleso sikhathi.
I think that would be great	Ngicabanga ukuthi lokho kungaba kuhle kakhulu
However, you should not have done it.	Noma kunjalo, bekungafanele ukwenze.
My work is so good.	Umsebenzi wami muhle kanjalo.
I want to learn more about you	Ngifuna ukufunda okwengeziwe ngawe
That should not happen.	Lokho akufanele kwenzeke.
He knows what it is.	Yena uyazi ukuthi yini.
But it did not have to be this way.	Kodwa kwakungadingeki ukuba kwenziwe kanjalo.
That's the truth.	Yilokho iqiniso.
It would be better for us.	Kungaba ngcono kithi.
It will get better this way.	Kuzoba ngcono ngale ndlela.
It's really nice here.	Kuhle impela lapha.
I did not know it at the time	Ngangingazi ngaleso sikhathi
I did not want to	Ngangingafuni
I will not know that either.	Nami ngeke ngikwazi lokho.
I thought for a long time so hard	Ngacabanga isikhathi eside ngakho kanzima
I know this seems hard for you	Ngiyazi ukuthi lokhu kubonakala kunzima kuwe
I have a lot to do tomorrow	Kuningi okufanele ngikwenze kusasa
I live in a beautiful place	Ngihlala endaweni enhle
I saw what was happening	Ngabona ukuthi kwenzekani
I apologize to you.	Ngiyaxolisa kuwe.
You have to do these.	Kufanele wenze lezi.
I want that too.	Nami ngifuna lokho.
I can't remember who it was.	Angisakhumbuli ukuthi ubani.
Not months.	Hhayi izinyanga.
This will be easier for you.	Lokhu kuzoba lula kuwe.
They didn’t know better, of course.	Bengazi kangcono, kunjalo.
You have to think about us.	Kufanele ucabange ngathi.
I did not hear what he said	Angizange ngizwe ukuthi uthini
I get to my classroom quickly	Ngifika ngokushesha ekilasini lami
Something had to happen.	Kukhona okwakudingeka kwenzeke.
I never thought it would be so difficult	Bengingacabangi ukuthi kuzoba nzima kangako
He returned to the room immediately.	Wabuyela ekamelweni ngokushesha.
I would not do	bengingeke ngenze
Or maybe a boy friend.	Noma mhlawumbe umngane umfana.
He will never come.	Ngeke neze afike.
Slowly, of course	Kancane kancane, kunjalo
I wanted to go to school	Ngangifuna ukuya esikoleni
I want to work.	Ngifuna ukusebenza.
Not a new problem.	Akuyona inkinga entsha.
Because it's so good, and you know it is.	Ngoba kuhle kakhulu, futhi uyazi ukuthi kunjalo.
He looked at everyone.	Wabuka wonke umuntu.
I walked slowly	Ngihambe kancane
I asked a lot of questions	Ngabuza imibuzo eminingi
Everything should be simple, easy, easy.	Konke kumele kube lula, kube lula, kube lula.
I did not leave immediately.	Angizange ngihambe ngaso leso sikhathi.
Maybe you want to make sure you stay tonight.	Mhlawumbe ufuna ukwenza isiqiniseko sokuthi uhlala namuhla ebusuku.
I just need to be with you	Ngidinga nje ukuba nawe
He should have known better, really.	Bekufanele azi kangcono, ngempela.
I spoke to him yesterday morning	Ngikhulume naye izolo ngesikhathi sasekuseni
How good is that ?.	Kuhle kangakanani lokho?.
I have done some work on this.	Ngenze umsebenzi othile kulokhu.
I think you are wrong.	Ngicabanga ukuthi unephutha.
She can cook well.	Uyakwazi ukupheka kahle.
Or good for me.	Noma kuhle kimi.
You and no one else.	Wena futhi akekho omunye.
I should have known he wouldn't be	Kufanele ngabe ngazi ukuthi wayengeke abe
You will do what you have to do.	Uzokwenza lokho okumele ukwenze.
This is a test.	Lokhu ukuhlolwa.
I didn't know about that	Bengingazi ngalokho
I know everyone wants to know	Ngiyazi wonke umuntu ufuna ukwazi
I want to know why you did this	Ngifuna ukwazi ukuthi kungani wenze lokhu
I couldn't walk, just yet	Angikwazanga ukuhamba, okwamanje
Or rather he could not.	Noma kunalokho akakwazanga.
I can no longer do anything on my own	Angisakwazi ukwenza lutho ngedwa
He will not be able to leave tomorrow.	Ngeke akwazi ukuhamba kusasa.
I want a really new one	Ngifuna entsha ngempela
I could not stop crying	Angikwazanga ukuyeka ukukhala
I want to fix things	Ngifuna ukulungisa izinto
I should have known better at first	Bekufanele ngabe ngazi kangcono ekuqaleni
I don't want to think anything.	Angifuni ukucabanga lutho.
But sometimes, that's not the way it should be.	Kodwa ngezinye izikhathi, akuyona indlela okufanele kube ngayo.
I know where you are studying	Ngiyazi ukuthi ufunda kuphi
A story he can't do to help.	Indaba angeke akwazi ukuyenza ukusiza.
Great about it.	Okukhulu ngakho.
I need to do a few things	Ngidinga ukwenza izinto ezimbalwa
I really hope so.	Ngethemba ngempela kanjalo.
But this is not just the truth.	Kodwa lokhu akulona nje iqiniso.
We need a phone.	Sidinga ucingo .
There is only one thing.	Kukhona enye into kuphela.
I did not want to talk about this	Ngangingafuni ukukhuluma ngalokhu
I thought everything would be fine	Bengicabanga ukuthi konke kuzoba ngcono
I thought she felt the same way	Ngacabanga ukuthi naye uzizwa ngendlela efanayo
Every single thing.	Yonke into eyodwa.
Not his parents.	Hhayi abazali bakhe.
I can't believe you did such a thing.	Angikholwa ukuthi wenze into enjalo.
At least three.	Okungenani ezintathu.
There is no restraint.	Akukho ukuzibamba.
He did not want to say yes.	Wayengafuni ukuthi yebo.
I couldn't even say his name	Angikwazanga ngisho ukusho igama lakhe
Not to him but.	Hhayi kuye kodwa.
I can no longer wait	Angisakwazi ukulinda
I have no way	Anginayo indlela
I'd better do something else	Kungcono ngenze okunye
I can't remember which one	Angisakhumbuli ukuthi iyiphi
I will go now	Ngizohamba manje
I have to talk to you.	Kumele ngikhulume nawe.
Really this time.	Ngempela lesi sikhathi.
I'm sure he is asleep now	Ngiqinisekile ukuthi ulele manje
I could not do more.	Angikwazanga ukwenza okwengeziwe.
You can't be him.	Ngeke ube nguye.
I can't do that yet.	Angikwazi ukukwenza lokho okwamanje.
I wanted to know more about you.	Bengifuna ukwazi okwengeziwe ngawe.
I spoke to him only once this week	Ngikhulume naye kanye kuphela kuleli sonto
Bad to wait.	Okubi ukulinda.
You want to get the right answer.	Ufuna ukuthola impendulo efanele.
Not always.	Akunjalo ngaso sonke isikhathi.
The biggest problem has been my health.	Inkinga enkulu kube impilo yami.
She was scared now.	Wayesaba manje.
You're going to have dinner, of course.	Uzohlala isidlo sakusihlwa, kunjalo.
Or eat before you leave.	Noma udle ngaphambi kokuba uhambe.
I should not have been here	Bekungafanele ngibe lapha
And yes, you know.	Futhi yebo, uyazi.
There is no single correct answer.	Ayikho impendulo eyodwa kuphela efanele.
If you are talented.	Uma unekhono.
I want to spend more time with you	Ngifuna ukuchitha isikhathi esiningi nawe
Just three days, he thought.	Izinsuku ezintathu nje, wacabanga.
I'm really thinking of going	Ngicabanga ngempela ukuhamba
I live in my house.	Ngihlala endlini yami.
I knew it wouldn't happen	Ngangazi ukuthi ngeke kube khona
I've been here ever since	Bengilokhu ngilapha kusukela ngaleso sikhathi
That happened to me a few times.	Lokho kwenzeka kimi izikhathi ezimbalwa.
It all happened to him.	Konke kwenzeka kuye.
You must go with me now.	Kumele uhambe nami manje.
I wish I could, but I don't.	Ngifisa sengathi ngabe, kodwa akunjalo.
I wish you had told me right away	Ngifisa sengathi ngabe ungitshele ngokushesha
Now, everyone knows everyone and it is very difficult.	Manje, wonke umuntu wazi wonke umuntu futhi kunzima kakhulu.
I did not see anyone else nearby	Angizange ngibone omunye umuntu eduze
I had no idea who my father was	Ngangingazi ukuthi ubani ubaba
Done.	Kwenziwe.
Or, almost immediately.	Noma, cishe ngokushesha.
I don't remember when	Angisakhumbuli nini
I want you to say my name.	Ngifuna usho igama lami.
Very well since last night.	Kahle kahle kusukela izolo ebusuku.
I had never heard of this before and I did not know.	Angikaze ngizwe ngalokhu ngaphambili futhi ngangingazi.
I know that everything that happens is true	Ngiyazi ukuthi konke okwenzekayo kuyiqiniso
He thought it was okay.	Wayecabanga ukuthi kulungile.
Not for you.	Hhayi kuwe.
I can find it later	Ngingakwazi ukuthola kamuva
I can't really find that.	Angikwazi ngempela ukuthola lokho.
I never talked to him about it	Angikaze ngikhulume naye ngakho
I did not want to die alone	Ngangingafuni ukufa ngedwa
I did not want to know	Ngangingafuni ukwazi
I do not believe this will happen	Angikholwa ukuthi lokhu kuzokwenzeka
I wanted to know what was going on around him.	Ngangifuna ukwazi ukuthi kwenzekani eduze kwakhe.
He had to go.	Kwadingeka ahambe.
I tried to adjust my thinking	Ngazama ukulungisa umbono wami
I was not happy about that, yes	Angizange ngijabule ngalokho, yebo
I need more exit	Ngidinga ukuphuma okwengeziwe
I knew she would be fine	Ngangazi ukuthi uzoba muhle
I don't know why, you just know.	Angazi ukuthi kungani, uyazi nje.
I need help	Ngidinga usizo
If he goes, that's fine.	Uma ehamba, kuhle.
I can find it later.	Ngingakwazi ukuthola kamuva.
He soon realized that he had made a serious mistake.	Wabona ngokushesha ukuthi wenze iphutha elikhulu kakhulu.
A little to us.	Kancane kithi.
As maybe every afternoon.	Njengoba mhlawumbe njalo ntambama.
Or maybe three.	Noma mhlawumbe ezintathu.
But he does not.	Kodwa akanayo.
I never went to college.	Angizange ngiye ekolishi.
He says his family does not want him to talk to me.	Uthi umndeni wakhe awufuni ukuthi akhulume nami.
You probably live in one place.	Cishe uhlale endaweni eyodwa.
I don't know why he did that.	Angazi ukuthi kungani enze lokho.
Little did I know that this had happened	Bengingazi nokuthi kwenzeke lokhu
For now he was thinking only of getting things.	Okwamanje wayecabanga ukuthola izinto kuphela.
I could not stop one.	Angikwazanga ukuyeka enye.
I know how you like it	Ngiyazi ukuthi uthanda kanjani
I'm happy about that	Ngijabule ngalokho
I didn’t get better fast enough	Angizange ngibe ngcono ngokushesha ngokwanele
He made friends.	Wenza abangane.
I really wish that was better	Ngifisa ngempela lokho kube ngcono
I knew it was going to be very difficult	Ngangazi ukuthi kuzoba nzima kakhulu
I've been thinking about this for a long time.	Sekuyisikhathi eside ngicabanga ngalokhu.
I knew nothing about him	Bengingazi lutho ngaye
Every year we have to do the same thing.	Njalo ngonyaka kufanele senze into efanayo.
Just the truth.	Iqiniso nje.
This will not happen to me.	Lokhu ngeke kwenzeke kimi.
I could not stop thinking about you	Angikwazanga ukuyeka ukucabanga ngawe
You do not want to do that.	Awufuni ukwenza lokho.
But someone else has to do it.	Kodwa omunye umuntu kufanele akwenze.
But too many times.	Kodwa izikhathi eziningi kakhulu.
Everything my father did.	Konke ubaba akwenzile.
I did not want to go without him	Ngangingafuni ukuhamba ngaphandle kwakhe
I can't remember exactly how long maybe a few weeks	Angisakhumbuli kahle ukuthi isikhathi esingakanani mhlawumbe amasonto ambalwa
I can make music now	Ngingakwazi ukwenza umculo manje
All right, a little.	Kulungile, kancane.
I can not live without her.	Angeke ngikwazi ukuphila ngaphandle kwakhe.
This is really good.	Lokhu kuhle ngempela.
I think he would like to see you	Ngicabanga ukuthi angathanda ukukubona
Certainly not the police.	Impela akuwona amaphoyisa.
But why did this happen.	Kodwa kungani lokhu kwenzeke.
I can't do it right away	Angikwazi ukukwenza ngokushesha
Maybe it should.	Mhlawumbe bekufanele.
I thought you might have said something to him	Bengithi kungenzeka ukuthi usho okuthile kuye
I can't wait to talk to you every day	Angisakwazi ukulinda ukukhuluma nawe nsuku zonke
I wanted him to stay that way.	Bengifuna ahlale kanjalo.
And we actually did well.	Futhi empeleni senze kahle.
No one makes you do anything.	Akekho owenza ukuthi wenze noma yini.
And someone will do just that.	Futhi othile uzokwenza lokho kanye.
I just want to see you	Ngifuna ukukubona kuphela
I'll be there for you	Ngizoba lapho kuwe
I wanted so many times	Ngangifuna izikhathi eziningi kangaka
I did not know that he was coming	Ngangingazi ukuthi uzofika
I am the one asking for help.	Yimina ngicela usizo.
I need to go home a little bit	Ngidinga ukuya ekhaya kancane
Just in case.	Uma kwenzeka nje.
By the time he got home.	Ngesikhathi efika ekhaya.
But not today.	Kodwa hhayi namuhla.
I did not go every day	Angizange ngihambe nsuku zonke
I better go.	Kungcono ngihambe.
First to speak.	Okokuqala ukukhuluma.
I feel like maybe it should have been	Ngizwa sengathi mhlawumbe bekufanele kube njalo
I don't remember doing this	Angisakhumbuli ngenza lokhu
I know your mother would not	Ngiyazi umama wakho ubengeke
I didn't want anything either	Nami ngangingafuni lutho

He came here to appear here.	Ufike kanje ukuze abonakale lapha.
Together or not.	Ndawonye noma cha.
I do this slowly	Ngenza lokhu kancane kancane
A long shot, but you can not	Isibhamu eside, kodwa awukwazi
I couldn’t get out of it, really	Angikwazanga ukuphuma kukho, ngempela
I saw and heard things	Ngabona futhi ngezwa izinto
I think it might be something else	Ngicabanga ukuthi kungase kube okunye
At least once.	Okungenani kanye.
I just wanted to spend time with you	Bengifuna ukuba nesikhathi nawe kuphela
First many times.	Okokuqala izikhathi eziningi.
Next year, maybe.	Ngonyaka ozayo, mhlawumbe.
Probably all, he thought.	Mhlawumbe konke, wacabanga.
I'm trying to fix that now.	Ngizama ukulungisa lokho manje.
He tried one.	Wazama enye.
I think you should go now	Ngicabanga ukuthi kufanele uhambe manje

Not to me, not.	Hhayi kimi, ngeke.
I will not tell you his name	Ngeke ngikutshele igama lakhe
Not him, at least.	Hhayi yena, okungenani.
I feel bad when I think about it	Ngizizwa kabi lapho ngicabanga

That can't be too much.	Angeke kwenzeke lokho kakhulu.

That will not be necessary.	Lokho ngeke kudingeke.
You know, you know.	Uyazi, uyazi.
She is very happy about it.	Ujabule kakhulu ngakho.

I can no longer think about it	Angisakwazi ukucabanga ngakho
There is no better.	Akukho ngcono.

That's perfectly fine.	Lokho kulungile ngokuphelele.
I have to think for a long time	Kufanele ngicabange ngesikhathi eside
He thought quickly.	Wacabanga ngokushesha.
I can't believe it's been three years	Angikholwa ukuthi sekuphele iminyaka emithathu
Little did I know that it would be extremely difficult for you	Bengingazi ukuthi kuzoba nzima kakhulu kuwe
I couldn't help it	Bengingeke ngikwazi ukuzibamba
Sounds better to me.	Kuzwakala kungcono kimi.
I saw only one dog	Ngibone inja eyodwa kuphela
It is called, and a good name.	Kuthiwa, futhi igama elihle.
That time is not now.	Leso sikhathi akusona manje.
I thought we should be family	Ngangicabanga ukuthi kufanele sibe umndeni
Her father needs to talk to her.	Ubaba wakhe udinga ukukhuluma naye.
He doesn't have a phone.	Akanalo ucingo.
I didn't have to be happy about it	Kwakungadingeki ukuba ngijabule ngakho
I will not do that here.	Ngeke ngikwenze lokho lapha.
Maybe tonight or tomorrow.	Mhlawumbe namuhla ebusuku noma kusasa.
The rest is obvious.	Okunye kusobala.
I want to make mistakes	Ngifuna ukwenza amaphutha
You will probably be editing one right now.	Cishe uzobe uhlela eyodwa njengamanje.
Not if you look like this.	Hhayi uma ubukeka kanje.

I can't remember his name	Angisakhumbuli igama lakhe
If so, that's fine.	Uma kunjalo, kuhle.

You just wouldn't.	Ubungeke nje.
How to see it all.	Ukubona kanjani konke.
So I wonder why that happened.	Ngakho ngiyazibuza ukuthi kungani lokho kwenzeka.
He is not a man.	Akuyena umuntu.
There is no other problem on the table.	Ayikho enye inkinga etafuleni.
I knew all about that	Ngangazi konke ngalokho
Not everyone, no.	Akuwona wonke umuntu, cha.
And do it once and for all.	Futhi ukwenze kanye futhi.

I think that's his name	Ngicabanga ukuthi igama lakhe lelo
I did not know about your work until now	Bengingazi ngomsebenzi wakho kuze kube manje

I should not have spoken	Bekungafanele ngikhulume
Who would you like to talk to? 	Ungathanda ukukhuluma nobani?
I feel it every night	Ngizizwa njalo ebusuku

Probably not many, though.	Mhlawumbe hhayi abaningi, kodwa.
I wanted to help right now	Bengifuna ukusiza njengamanje
I never thought about it in the first place	Angizange ngicabange ngakho ekuqaleni

He looked up.	Wabheka phezulu.
I just wanted to end this.	Bengifuna nje ukuqeda lokhu.

But something happened.	Kodwa kukhona okwenzekile.
I thought, it's time	Ngacabanga, sekuyisikhathi
It was really good.	Kube kuhle impela.
Your marriage, your job, your family.	Umshado wakho, umsebenzi wakho, umndeni wakho.
This we should not do and we will not do it.	Lokhu akufanele sikwenze futhi ngeke sikwenze.
Good in the city.	Kuhle edolobheni.
That's my opinion.	Lowo' umbono wami.

He just wanted to quit.	Wayefuna nje ukuyeka.
I want to be human	Ngifuna ukuba umuntu
I'm not sure how long.	Angazi kahle ukuthi kuze kube nini.

Good to have you here.	Kuhle ukuba nawe lapha.
I did not want to at first	Ngangingafuni ekuqaleni

I wish I was today	Ngifisa sengathi ngabe namuhla
I'm really sorry yesterday	Ngiyaxolisa ngempela izolo
Not so much a team or a team.	Hhayi kakhulu iqembu noma iqembu.

And neither was I.	Futhi nami kwakungeyena.
I can't go on with it.	Angikwazi ukuqhubeka nakho.

I hope he feels the same way about me	Ngethemba ukuthi naye uzizwa ngendlela efanayo ngami
I want to quit smoking	Ngifuna ukuyeka ukubhema

You do not want to die like that.	Awufuni ukufa kanjalo.

I did not speak immediately	Angizange ngikhulume ngokushesha
And it will be difficult.	Futhi kuzoba nzima.

I don’t really want to talk about this	Angifuni ngempela ukukhuluma ngalokhu
But he refused to go.	Kodwa wenqaba ukuhamba.
Years to come together.	Iminyaka ezayo ndawonye.
It is good to talk.	Kuhle ukukhuluma.
I never thought about it, but maybe	Angikaze ngicabange ngakho, kodwa mhlawumbe
Until a few weeks later.	Kuze kube amasonto ambalwa kamuva.

Not in the middle.	Cha phakathi.
Or make time.	Noma wenze isikhathi.
It is not a job or a job.	Akuwona umsebenzi noma umsebenzi.
I had to find something very quickly.	Kwadingeka ngithole okuthile ngokushesha okukhulu.
You need to know that you can too.	Kumele wazi ukuthi nawe ungakwazi.
I have not been there long enough.	Angizange ngibe lapho isikhathi eside ngokwanele.
Because.	Ngoba.
It shouldn’t have said much	Bekungafanele ngisho okuningi
I'm not sure that's right.	Anginaso isiqiniseko sokuthi lokho kulungile.
But still nothing.	Kodwa namanje lutho.
So we went to your room.	Ngakho siye ekamelweni lakho.

I, for the first time, never did	Mina, okokuqala, angikaze ngenze
I should not be here.	Akufanele ngibe lapha.

In this way, everyone is happy.	Ngale ndlela, wonke umuntu uyajabula.
Not really a big deal.	Akuyona into enkulu ngempela.

I still can't tell you any more	Namanje angikwazi ukukutshela okunye
It is not just a name.	Akulona nje igama.
For now only.	Okwamanje kuphela.
He did not do that either.	Naye akakwenzanga lokho.
I wanted to stay in the house	Ngangifuna ukuhlala endlini
He didn't know how to do it for so long.	Wayengazi ukuthi enze kanjani isikhathi eside.
I have never done such a thing	Angikaze ngiyenze into enjalo
I want to work in my home	Ngifuna ukusebenza ekhaya lami
There is something else to do.	Kukhona okunye okumele ukwenze.

I suspect you never did	Ngiyasola awukaze wenze njalo

If you don't do it, don't do it.	Uma ungakwenzi, ungakwenzi.
Not yet, but soon.	Hhayi okwamanje, kodwa maduze.
Bad decision, just as he was scared	Isinqumo esibi, njengoba nje wayesaba
I just can't do that	Angikwazi nje ukukwenza lokho

Because you know so well.	Ngoba wazi kahle.
I hope it looks true	Ngethemba ukuthi kubukeka kuyiqiniso

Let me see now.	Ake ngibone manje.
Most of the time actually	Isikhathi esiningi empeleni

Well no one knows.	Kahle kanjani akekho owaziyo.
I shouldn’t have been there, actually	Bekungafanele ngibe khona, empeleni
I've thought about it many times.	Ngiye ngacabanga ngakho kaningi.

Sounds great.	Umsindo omkhulu.

Or he thought he did.	Noma wacabanga ukuthi ukwenzile.
In a good hospital.	Esibhedlela esihle.
I should not have said that it was your fault	Bekungafanele ngisho ukuthi iphutha lakho
I need help with this	Ngidinga usizo ngalokhu

I want to see a doctor	Ngifuna ukubona udokotela
I only did it once.	Ngikwenze kanye nje.

I need to stop talking	Ngidinga ukuyeka ukukhuluma
Too much talking.	Ukukhuluma kakhulu.
He is very sleepy.	Ulele impela.

I made sure, I tried something else first	Ngenza isiqiniseko, ngazama okunye kuqala
I had to think long and hard	Kwadingeka ngicabange isikhathi eside futhi kanzima
My father never did that.	Ubaba akakaze akwenze lokho.
I couldn’t figure out why at first.	Angikwazanga ukuthola ukuthi kungani ekuqaleni.
Obviously he would not do that.	Ngokusobala wayengeke akwenze lokho.

Our way home.	Indlela yethu ekhaya.
I had no idea why he did that	Ngangingazi ukuthi kungani enze lokho
I mean, you need to find out the truth about this	Ngisho, udinga ukuthola iqiniso ngalokhu

But that is what happened.	Kodwa yilokho okwenzeka.

There is nothing wrong with that.	Akukho okubi ngaye.

So far, no.	Kuze kube manje, akunjalo.

One has to help the person.	Umuntu kumele amsize umuntu.

I had no idea it was so good	Ngangingazi ukuthi kuhle kangako

It’s not a place, of course.	Akuyona indawo, kunjalo.
He thought he should say something, but he did not know what.	Wacabanga ukuthi kufanele asho okuthile, kodwa wayengazi ukuthi yini.
He said he was a student.	Uthe ungumfundi.
I didn't want to think about him at all	Ngangingafuni nhlobo ukucabanga ngaye

At least, for now.	Okungenani, okwamanje.
I just wish you would stay with me and eat	Ngifisa nje ukuthi uzohlala nami futhi udle

But for now that will not happen.	Kodwa okwamanje ngeke kwenzeke lokho.
I knew it had to be you	Ngangazi ukuthi kufanele kube nguwe
I said you want to be alone	Bengithi ufuna ukuba wedwa
I wanted to have a family	Ngangifuna ukuba nomndeni
That would be a hat.	Lokho kuzoba isigqoko.
I know this to be absolutely true	Ngiyazi ukuthi lokhu kuyiqiniso ngokuphelele
No response, so far.	Ayikho impendulo, kuze kube manje.
I need to stop thinking about this	Ngidinga ukuyeka ukucabanga ngalokhu
It's not you.	Awuyena wena.
And here again.	Futhi lapha futhi.

Or he told me it was him.	Noma wangitshela ukuthi nguye.
You have entered.	Uke wangena.
But no, he thought, he would never.	Kodwa cha, wacabanga, wayengeke neze.
He never knew the worst about her.	Akakaze azi okubi kakhulu ngaye.
He stayed like this with me.	Wahlala kanje nami.
I will not let anyone do anything to you	Ngeke ngivumele muntu enze noma yini kuwe
And he got one.	Futhi wathola eyodwa.
That is what the family does	Yilokho okwenziwa umndeni
If you stay that long.	Uma uhlala isikhathi eside kangako.
But this is not his best job.	Kodwa lena akuwona umsebenzi wakhe omuhle kakhulu.
I was thinking about you today	Bengicabanga ngawe namuhla
You did the right thing.	Wenze into efanele impela.
Now you need to get out of here.	Manje udinga ukuphuma lapha.

I just can't believe it	Angikholwa nje
That's the first one.	Yilokho kuqala.

Only people.	Abantu kuphela.
I think that should be a good thing	Ngicabanga ukuthi lokho kufanele kube yinto enhle
I don't want to be here either.	Nami angifuni ukuba lapha.
I was just thinking about that	Bengicabanga ngalokho nje
I didn't know you could do this	Bengingazi ukuthi ungakwenza lokhu
I thought we made a great team	Bengicabanga ukuthi senze iqembu elikhulu
Everyone knows that is not true.	Wonke umuntu uyazi ukuthi lokho akulona iqiniso.
Because you have to do it the right way.	Ngoba kufanele ukwenze ngendlela efanele.
I settled down immediately	Ngihlale ngokushesha
We just want to play.	Sifuna ukudlala nje.
Very, very quickly.	Kakhulu, ngokushesha kakhulu.
I would do anything to be with you	ngabe ngenza noma yini ukuze ngibe nawe
It looks like you.	Kubukeka njengawe.
I like to do it the right way.	Ngithanda ukwenza ngendlela.
I wanted an accident.	Ngangifuna ingozi.
I never thought he would come back	Angikaze ngicabange ukuthi uzobuya
I don’t know how wrong that would be.	Angazi ukuthi kungaba iphutha kangakanani.
I have always wanted to help people	Bengilokhu ngifuna ukusiza abantu
I don't really know what you're talking about	Angazi ngempela ukuthi ukhuluma ngani
I think that's a good question.	Ngicabanga ukuthi umbuzo omuhle.
So it should be.	Ngakho kufanele kube.
It's not his thing at all.	Akuyona into yakhe nhlobo.
You know what you're talking about.	Uyazi ukuthi ukhuluma ngani.
He didn't know what it was, but something.	Wayengazi ukuthi yini, kodwa okuthile.
I think about that all the time	Ngicabanga ngalokho ngaso sonke isikhathi
Time always now.	Isikhathi njalo manje.
I can no longer live with this	Angisakwazi ukuphila nalokhu
This is not my son.	Akuyona indodana yami lena.
I actually thought about it for a while	Empeleni ngacabanga ngathi into isikhashana
He says he did well.	Uthi wenze kahle.
I will never be happy again.	Angeke ngiphinde ngijabule.
No we didn't.	Cha asizange.
But that is what happened.	Kodwa yilokho okwenzekile.
A good idea is a good idea	Umbono omuhle umqondo omuhle
I don't want anything.	Angifuni lutho.
Maybe a lot now.	Mhlawumbe okuningi manje.
You must not do this alone.	Akumele wenze lokhu uwedwa.
But that is not all.	Kodwa akukhona nje lapho.
It is not necessary when reading a book.	Akudingekile uma ufunda incwadi.
I will not do that, not now	Ngeke ngikwenze lokho, hhayi manje
I can’t take much with me anyway	Angikwazi ukuthatha okuningi nami noma kunjalo
I want to do this.	Ngifuna ukwenza lokhu.
I wanted to go home at that time	Ngangifuna ukuya ekhaya ngaleso sikhathi
Great place with us	Indawo enhle nathi
I know about that	Ngiyazi ngalokho
I still do not see anything	Namanje angiboni lutho
That would be a little better.	Lokho kungaba kuhle kancane.
Bad choices.	Ukukhetha okubi.
I had to stay a long time there	Bekufanele ngihlale isikhathi eside lapho
He probably didn't think so about it, though.	Cishe wayengacabangi kanjalo ngakho, noma kunjalo.
Would that really be so difficult ?.	Kungaba nzima kangaka lokho ngempela?.
I always think this way	Ngihlale ngicabanga ngale ndlela
People say he will never do that again.	Abantu bathi ngeke aphinde akwenze lokho.
I need to see you as soon as possible	Ngidinga ukukubona ngokushesha ngangokunokwenzeka
It happens to all of us.	Kwenzeka kithi sonke.
He cannot speak.	Akakwazi ukukhuluma.
And it just isn't.	Futhi ayikho nje.
I will be.	Ngizoba .
The whole team is needed.	Kudingeka iqembu lonke.
I can't get in like that.	Angikwazi ukungena kanjalo.
I want to make a living with you	Ngifuna ukwenza impilo nawe
I would not be so beautiful.	Bengingeke ngibe muhle kangako.
And that's why.	Futhi yingakho.
He bought his books.	Uthenge izincwadi zakhe.
It should, but it can't.	Kufanele, kodwa angeke.
But he spoke.	Kodwa wakhuluma.
I've done it many times	Ngikwenze izikhathi eziningi
She goes to work.	Uya emsebenzini.
Now let me tell you.	Manje ake ngikutshele.
I do not know when and how	Angazi nini futhi kanjani
I think about him all the time	Ngicabanga ngaye ngaso sonke isikhathi
I have to tell you.	Kumele ngikutshele.
I did not want to leave the house	Ngangingafuni ukuphuma endlini
As many as you want.	Abaningi njengoba ufuna.
I finally realized that the person was you	Ekugcineni ngabona ukuthi lowo muntu nguwe
Yes, that would be much better.	Yebo, lokho kungaba ngcono kakhulu.
Not that you need to talk.	Hhayi ukuthi udinga ukukhuluma.
This did not happen	Lokhu akuzange kwenzeke
Almost a long time ago.	Cishe isikhathi eside.
I didn't know either	Nami bengingazi
Without you you read this.	Ngaphandle kwakho ufunda lokhu.
I could not get in there	Angikwazanga ukungena lapho
We can't see you.	Asikwazi ukukubona.
I tried hard to think of him	Ngazama kanzima ukucabanga ngaye
I would have done the same thing	Ngabe ngenze into efanayo
I will not always be here	Ngeke ngihlale ngilapha
I'm waiting to get home.	Ngilinde ukufika ekhaya.
He hoped there were people there.	Wayenethemba lokuthi kukhona abantu lapho.
I don't know what happened to me.	Angazi ukuthi kwenzakalani ngami.
Probably not at once.	Mhlawumbe hhayi ngesikhathi esisodwa.
Someone is there.	Kukhona umuntu lapho.
My mother died a few years ago.	Umama washona eminyakeni embalwa edlule.
I think you know what happened	Ngicabanga ukuthi uyazi ukuthi kwenzekeni
I wanted to cry	Ngangifuna ukukhala
He could not sit still.	Akakwazanga ukuhlala phansi.
I hope you have time	Ngethemba ukuthi unesikhathi
I don't know much about it.	Angazi okuningi ngayo.
You always told me enough.	Ungitshele njalo ngokwanele.
Apparently, he had been there before.	Ngokusobala, wake waba lapho ngaphambili.
He must do this alone.	Kumele akwenze lokhu yedwa.
Not a very good job.	Akuwona umsebenzi omuhle kakhulu.
I did not want to get out of bed	Ngangingafuni ukuphuma embhedeni
At least, not in the world, though.	Okungenani, hhayi emhlabeni, noma kunjalo.
I should have gone years ago	Bekufanele ngihambe eminyakeni edlule
He will make it difficult for him.	Uzokwenza kube nzima kuye.
Finally his choice.	Ekugcineni ukukhetha kwakhe.
Of course not.	Yebo, angeke.
He decided he wanted to go home.	Wanquma ukuthi ufuna ukuya ekhaya.
Now anytime.	Manje noma nini.
I can't go on without you	Angeke ngikwazi ukuqhubeka ngaphandle kwakho
I mean, when you think about it.	Ngisho, uma ucabanga ngakho.
I hope you feel good about this.	Ngethemba ukuthi uzizwa kahle ngalokhu.
I want to know about you	Ngifuna ukwazi ngawe
I think everything that happened is much better	Ngicabanga ukuthi konke okwenzekile kungcono kakhulu
I do not know everything.	Angazi konke.
Slowly, actually.	Kancane, empeleni.
I was afraid to go back home	Ngesaba ukubuyela endlini
That doesn't mean anything to me now.	Lokho akusho lutho kimi manje.
I wanted to get home to him	Bengifuna ukufika ekhaya kuye
I came here yesterday	Ngize lapha izolo
I feel happy again.	Ngizizwa ngijabule futhi.
Not really a person.	Hhayi impela umuntu.
We only need one.	Sidinga eyodwa kuphela.
We know that, now.	Siyazi lokho, manje.
I want him to do something outside	Ngifuna enze okuthile ngaphandle
But there has to be something else happening.	Kodwa kufanele kube kukhona okunye okwenzekayo.
My whole shirt.	Ihembe lami lonke.
I should have come to you	Bekufanele ngize kuwe
I like to do that every afternoon at this time	Ngithanda ukwenza lokho njalo ntambama ngalesi sikhathi
But he thought of the children.	Kodwa wacabanga izingane.
The problem is not he.	Inkinga akayena.
You know what makes me go.	Uyazi ukuthi yini eyenza ngihambe.
But there is no need to do that right now.	Kodwa asikho isidingo sokwenza lokho okwamanje.
I think, the sooner, the better	Ngicabanga ukuthi, ngokushesha, kungcono
I wanted to drink too much	Ngangifuna ukuphuza kakhulu
This is not the whole problem or anything.	Lena akuyona yonke inkinga noma lutho.
I did not have to say anything	Kwakungadingeki ngikhulume lutho
Saying anything else would be a lie.	Ukusho noma yini enye kungaba amanga.
And he should do so.	Futhi kufanele enze kanjalo.
I could not wait to get to the end.	Angikwazanga ukulinda ukufika ekugcineni.
I just can’t do it for him	Angikwazi nje ukukwenza kuye
I wanted to know why this happened	Ngangifuna ukwazi ukuthi kungani kwenzeka lokhu
Still, much work has to be done.	Noma kunjalo, kuye kwadingeka umsebenzi omkhulu.
But this is okay for now.	Kodwa lokhu kulungile okwamanje.
But again, why does he want to.	Kodwa futhi, kungani efuna.
That's why we have to go there.	Yingakho kufanele siye lapho.
I need you to stay close	Ngidinga ukuthi uhlale eduze
I could not say better myself.	Bengingeke ngisho kangcono mina.
I knew there was no one else here	Ngangazi ukuthi akekho omunye lapha
I'm happy about it.	Ngijabule ngakho.
That can be difficult enough.	Lokho kungaba nzima ngokwanele.
I didn't want to get married right away	Ngangingafuni ukushada ngaso leso sikhathi
So tell me what the problem is.	Ngakho ngitshele ukuthi yini inkinga.
It will take work and time.	Kuzothatha umsebenzi nesikhathi.
I will be your friend	Ngizoba umngane wakho
I know exactly what you are talking about.	Ngiyazi kahle ukuthi ukhuluma ngani.
Very good question	Umbuzo omuhle impela
But, maybe not.	Kodwa, mhlawumbe akunjalo.
He said he did.	Uthe ukwenzile.
You or he.	Nawe noma yena.
I think something big is happening soon	Ngicabanga ukuthi kukhona okukhulu okwenzekayo maduze
And do that again.	Futhi wenze lokho futhi.
My friends.	Abangane bami.
I heard his voice at the door	Ngezwa izwi lakhe emnyango
Just when I arrived.	Khona lapho ngifika.
I feel like I have to have something	Ngizwa sengathi kukhona okumele ngibe nakho
Now you can't.	Manje awukwazi.
Meat is not a problem.	Inyama akuyona inkinga.
Not definitely, but maybe.	Hhayi nakanjani, kodwa mhlawumbe.
I did not wait for the ride.	Angizange ngilinde ukugibela.
I'm glad this happened.	Ngiyajabula ukuthi lokhu kwenzeka.
He did not want it to be easy.	Wayengafuni kube lula.
It deserves someone.	Kufanele umuntu.
I will be, too	Ngizoba njalo, nami
And, that's fine.	Futhi, lokho kulungile.
Let me think for a moment.	Ake ngicabange isikhashana.
And that is actually very good.	Futhi lokho empeleni kuhle kakhulu.
I mean, obviously one has to do it.	Ngisho, kusobala ukuthi umuntu kufanele akwenze.
I could not tell anyone about this	Angikwazanga ukutshela muntu ngalokhu
Now you want it again.	Manje ufuna futhi.
I have not been able to return to my room yet.	Angikwazanga ukubuyela ekamelweni lami okwamanje.
I would love to see you in your new home	Ngingathanda ukukubona endlini yakho entsha
Mom wants to leave right away.	Umama ufuna ukuhamba ngokushesha.
This is not my dress.	Akuyona ingubo yami lena.
He heard another noise over there.	Wezwa omunye umsindo ngale.
Because obviously we had to do that.	Ngoba kusobala ukuthi kwakudingeka sikwenze lokho.
I'm going home.	Ngiya ekhaya.
Maybe even a little.	Mhlawumbe ngisho kancane.
I've been thinking about that too.	Nami kade ngicabanga ngalokho.
Everyone wants to make money.	Wonke umuntu ufuna ukwenza imali.
I need to get some clothes	Ngidinga ukuthola izingubo
It may be, but not immediately.	Kungaba njalo, kodwa hhayi ngokushesha.
I didn't want another problem	Ngangingafuni enye inkinga
I mean, obviously one has to do it	Ngisho, kusobala ukuthi umuntu kufanele akwenze
But not in my house.	Kodwa hhayi endlini yami.
This may be the case with you.	Lokhu kungase kube njalo kuwe.
Not entirely.	Hhayi ngokuphelele.
I can't do much about that.	Angikwazi ukwenza okuningi ngalokho.
Or good.	Noma kuhle.
Death soon.	Ukufa maduze.
I can't, I can't, I can't.	Angikwazi, angikwazi, angikwazi.
I'm not sure anyone really knows.	Angiqiniseki ukuthi ukhona owaziyo ngempela.
Not his father.	Hhayi ubaba wakhe.
The new one took over.	Omusha wathatha.
But no one knows anything.	Kodwa akekho owaziyo lutho.
I thought only of him	Ngangicabanga ngaye kuphela
I never went home.	Angikaze ngiye ekhaya.
I need someone who knows what he is doing	Ngidinga umuntu owaziyo ukuthi wenzani
But it will not be.	Kodwa angeke kube njalo.
But, this is better.	Kodwa, lokhu kungcono.
Very soon	Ngokushesha kakhulu
I heard a little.	Ngizwe kancane.
I knew this was not true	Ngangazi ukuthi lokhu akulona iqiniso
He goes to work.	Ahambe aye emsebenzini.
I found pictures.	Ngithole izithombe.
I can’t imagine how difficult your choice was	Angikwazi ukucabanga ukuthi ukukhetha kwakho kube nzima kangakanani
I'd better get it	Kungcono ngithole
Not if you want to continue for a long time.	Hhayi uma ufuna ukuqhubeka isikhathi eside.
That is what was needed here.	Yilokho okwakudingeka lapha.

My father went out.	Ubaba waphuma.
That is what he needed to do.	Yilokho okwakudingeka akwenze.
He will be, and he will be.	Uzoba nguye, yena abe nguwe.
I think you need to move on.	Ngicabanga ukuthi udinga ukuqhubeka.
He spoke well.	Wakhuluma kahle.
I wanted to do this alone	Ngangifuna ukwenza lokhu ngedwa
No to that, either.	Cha kulokho, futhi.
He has always been wrong.	Ubelokhu engalungile.
Please let me hear about you now.	Ngicela ngizwe ngawe manje.
But not this thing.	Kodwa hhayi le nto.
I never thought it would happen	Bengingacabangi ukuthi kuzoba khona
Not the first time, either.	Akukhona okokuqala, futhi.
He said something bad.	Akhulume into embi.
She does well and looks happy.	Wenza kahle futhi ubonakala ejabule.
I can't take anything now.	Ngeke ngikwazi ukuthatha lutho manje.
It's been many hours now.	Sekuphele amahora amaningi manje.
I need to do that now	Ngidinga ukwenza lokho manje
This is a good boy.	Umfana omuhle lo.
And that thing.	Futhi leyo nto.
I will never be alone or alone here	Ngeke neze ngibe ngedwa noma ngibe ngedwa lapha
Please, one time.	Ngicela, isikhathi esisodwa.
But don't do it.	Kodwa ungakwenzi.
I just love his play.	Ngithanda ukudlala kwakhe nje.
One way to do this is to.	Enye indlela yokwenza lokhu kanje.
But his bike.	Kodwa ibhayisikili lakhe.
I know things everywhere.	Ngazi izinto yonke indawo.
He didn't tell me much.	Akazange angitshele okuningi.
You don't have to do that.	Awudingi ukwenza lokho.
His death was unjust.	Ukufa kwakhe bekungafanele.
He leaves in the morning.	Uhamba ekuseni.
But the choice has been hers.	Kodwa ukukhetha kube nguye.
I have done well so far.	Ngenze kahle kuze kube manje.
Finally, something happened.	Ekugcineni, kukhona okwenzekile.
My little house.	Indlu yami encane.
To have a family now.	Ukuze uthole umndeni manje.
You do not need to say anything.	Awudingi ukusho lutho.
But you know, a little money for me.	Kodwa uyazi, imali encane kimi.
Occasionally.	Okwenzeka njalo.
Our father.	Ubaba wethu.
It should be in the morning.	Kufanele ekuseni.
My father left.	Ubaba wahamba.
You can drive.	Ungakwazi ukushayela.
And no, you can't see it.	Futhi cha, awukwazi ukukubona.
You should not be here.	Akufanele ube lapha.
It may be true.	Kungenzeka ukuthi kuyiqiniso.
He just saw that he was not human.	Wavele wabona ukuthi akayena umuntu.
At least not in my class.	Okungenani hhayi ekilasini lami.
I couldn't help myself.	Angikwazanga ukuzibamba mina.
Anyone can do anything.	Noma ubani angenza noma yini.
For me, for me.	Kimi, ngami.
He said he would be back right now.	Wathi uzobuya khona manje.
Either that or he knows nothing.	Noma lokho noma akazi lutho.
I have been thinking a lot about work lately.	Bengicabanga kakhulu ngomsebenzi muva nje.
At least, not alone.	Okungenani, hhayi yedwa.
We need money.	Sidinga imali.
And that he did.	Nalokho wakwenza.
I tried to read my book.	Ngazama ukufunda incwadi yami.
I can do it.	Ngingakwazi ukuyenza.
He would like it now, too.	Angathanda manje, futhi.
Age, if you want.	Iminyaka, uma ufuna.
No matter what you do.	Noma ngabe wenzani.
He doesn't have my time.	Akanaso isikhathi sami.
I thought that was it.	Ngacabanga ukuthi yilokho.
I can't do things.	Angikwazi ukwenza izinto.
One and the other.	Enye futhi enye.
And maybe it's better.	Futhi mhlawumbe kungcono.
And thank you for that.	Futhi ngiyabonga ngalokho.
I'm so sorry about that.	Ngiyaxolisa kakhulu ngakho.
At least not to us.	Okungenani hhayi kithi.
We both know.	Sobabili siyazi.
To say the least.	Ukusho kahle kakhulu.
Before you know it, you like it better outside.	Ngaphambi kokuthi wazi, uthanda kangcono ngaphandle.
It will not be the first time, either.	Ngeke kube okokuqala, futhi.
But that is not a problem.	Kodwa akuyona inkinga leyo.
We all know that this is not true.	Sonke siyazi ukuthi lokhu akulona iqiniso.
To know this.	Ukuze ukwazi lokhu.
No matter what happens.	Noma ngabe kwenzekani.
He thought better about it.	Wacabanga kangcono ngakho.
Certainly a story.	Impela indaba.
I am very sorry for what happened.	Ngiyaxolisa kakhulu lokhu okwenzekile.
But that's a bad way.	Kodwa indlela embi leyo.
Obviously not.	Kusobala ukuthi akekho.
You made a living here.	Wenze impilo lapha.
He didn't know he knew.	Wayengazi ukuthi uyazi.
You are wrong, you are very wrong.	Unephutha, unephutha kakhulu.
He left reluctantly.	Wahamba engafuni.
Or rather, he did.	Noma kunalokho, wakwenza.
He looked up.	Wabheka .
Or maybe a little bit.	Noma mhlawumbe kancane kancane.
He wants to be better.	Ufuna ukuba ngcono.
At times, we all need help.	Ngezinye izikhathi, sonke sidinga usizo.
I am waiting for my mother to come home.	Ngilinde umama abuye ekhaya.
Maybe he too.	Mhlawumbe yena naye .
And he also does not know.	Futhi naye akazi.
You know how and you know that.	Ukwazi ukuthi kanjani futhi ukwazi lokho.
So that I can go anywhere.	Ukuze ngingakwazi ukuya noma kuphi.
I don't have a good time with this.	Anginaso isikhathi esihle nalokhu.
I certainly knew about him.	Impela ngangazi ngaye.
This is not my choice, or not so much.	Lokhu akukhona ukukhetha kwami, noma hhayi kakhulu.
When he was young.	Lapho esemncane.
I could not think straight.	Angikwazanga ukucabanga kahle.
I have spoken well of him from the beginning.	Ngikhulume kahle ngaye kusukela ekuqaleni.
He wanted me to know.	Wayefuna ngazi.
He did, and he felt.	Wenza, futhi wazizwa.
I am very happy right now.	Ngijabule kakhulu njengamanje.
So my question is how do you do this.	Ngakho umbuzo wami ukuthi ukwenza kanjani lokhu.
Both.	Nobabili .
He became someone else.	Waba omunye umuntu.
Yes, you can, in fact.	Yebo, ungakwazi, empeleni.
He is indeed sleeping.	Impela ulele.
I did it quickly.	Ngenza ngokushesha.
I just need to sit down for a while.	Ngidinga nje ukuhlala phansi isikhashana.
By doing so many will not.	Ngokwenza abaningi ngeke.
He refused anyway.	Wenqaba kunjalo.
But he could not do it alone.	Kodwa wayengeke akwazi ukukwenza yedwa.
I'm so glad to hear your voice.	Ngijabule kakhulu ukuzwa izwi lakho.
He thought someone knew.	Wayecabanga ukuthi omunye uyazi.
I should have made a mistake.	Kufanele ngabe ngenza iphutha.
I wanted to be with you for a while.	Bengifuna ukuba nawe isikhashana.
I will be with him here.	Ngizoba naye lapha.
Everyone knows what happened.	Wonke umuntu uyazi ukuthi kwenzekeni.
But he has not said, yet.	Kodwa akazange asho, okwamanje.
Or a child.	Noma ingane.
I think everything.	Ngicabanga yonke into.
Is this true or false?	Ingabe lokhu kuyiqiniso noma amanga.
I think that happens a lot.	Ngicabanga ukuthi lokho kwenzeka kakhulu.
There is no death.	Akukho ukufa.
But it is only possible.	Kodwa kungenzeka kuphela.
It can be a problem.	Kungaba inkinga.
I never thought about that.	Angikaze ngicabange ngalokho.
Not a good place.	Akuyona indawo enhle.
He did it to me.	Wakwenza kimi.
Not just friends.	Hhayi nje abangani.
So I hope you stay here a long time.	Ngakho ngethemba ukuthi uzohlala lapha isikhathi eside.
But we do too much.	Kodwa senza okuningi kakhulu.
That is a big question.	Umbuzo omkhulu lowo.
Just one of us now.	Omunye nje wethu manje.
I didn’t really know what it was, but more.	Ngangingazi ngempela ukuthi yini, kodwa okwengeziwe.
I just had to.	Kwadingeka nje.
Worse yet, he took the blame.	Okubi kunalokho, wathatha icala.
Here you have the whole group.	Lapha uthole lonke iqembu.
You knew nothing about it.	Ubungazi lutho ngakho.
He could not think.	Akakwazanga ukucabanga.
His only chance.	Ithuba lakhe kuphela.
This is a car.	Imoto lena.
I do not understand why it happened.	Angiqondi ukuthi kungani kwenzeka.
But there is no better job.	Kodwa akukho ngcono emsebenzini.
I don't have to do it all at once.	Akumele ngikwenze konke ngesikhathi esisodwa.
No one yet.	Akukho muntu okwamanje.
I could not stop talking about you.	Angikwazanga ukuyeka ukukhuluma ngawe.
Finally he was able to think of something.	Ekugcineni wakwazi ukucabanga okuthile.
We do everything because we want to.	Senza konke ngoba sifuna.
I'll go and do something else.	Ngizohamba ngenze okunye.
I just wanted to sleep.	Bengifuna nje ukulala.
This looks.	Lokhu kubukeka.
In your car.	Emotweni yakho.
He wouldn't do anything about it now.	Wayengeke enze lutho ngalokho manje.
All of this happened because of him.	Konke lokhu kwenzeke ngenxa yakhe.
I do not understand why this is.	Angiqondi ukuthi kungani lokhu.
For years, really.	Iminyaka, ngempela.
He made this easy for me.	Wenza lokhu kube lula kimi.
Not my place.	Ayikho indawo yami.
But today there is nothing he can do.	Kodwa namuhla akukho angakwenza.
Food at work.	Ukudla emsebenzini.
So he went out and departed.	Ngakho waphuma wahamba.
It would be nice if you did that.	Kungaba kuhle uma wenza kanjalo.
Everyone is human.	Wonke umuntu ungumuntu.
He looked at his father.	Wabuka ubaba wakhe.
I do not know either.	Nami angazi.
Looks like nothing.	Kubonakala sengathi akukho lutho.
This sounds great.	Lokhu kuzwakala.
I'm doing better now, really.	Ngenza kangcono manje, ngempela.
It's not in there, either.	Akukho phakathi lapho, futhi.
Not just doing something.	Hhayi nje ukwenza okuthile.
Everyone used to talk about you.	Wonke umuntu wayevame ukukhuluma ngawe.
So far, no.	Kuze kube manje, ayikho.
As he always is.	Njengoba ehlala enjalo.
I really do not believe.	Angikholwa ngempela.
She's beautiful, but not that beautiful.	Muhle, kodwa hhayi ukuthi muhle.
But that will be difficult to do.	Kodwa lokho kuzoba nzima ukukwenza.
He said he had no other money.	Wathi akanayo enye imali.
He was with me last night.	Ube nami izolo ebusuku.
I don't have to go yet.	Akumele ngihambe okwamanje.
I have to go home.	Kufanele ngiye ekhaya.
He thought he was asleep.	Wayecabanga ukuthi ulele.
Not all this down, anyway.	Hhayi yonke le phansi, noma kanjani.
All of this is just fine.	Konke lokhu kuhle nje.
But he should not have known that.	Kodwa kwakungafanele akwazi lokho.
He has to be there.	Kufanele abe lapho.
But he got there.	Kodwa wafika lapho.
I don't think it does.	Angicabangi ukuthi ayikho.
I can't live in that.	Angikwazi ukuphila kulokho.
Please do so.	Ngicela wenze njalo.
This is not the case.	Lokhu akukhona okwenzekayo.
I've lived here too long.	Ngihlale isikhathi eside kakhulu lapha.
I still do not understand how this happened.	Namanje angiqondi ukuthi kwenzeke kanjani lokhu.
No, that's fine.	Cha, kuhle lokho.
You need to go back to the beginning.	Udinga ukubuyela ekuqaleni.
I made my decision.	Ngenze isinqumo sami.
Still, it is good to know.	Noma kunjalo, kuhle ukwazi.
As possible.	Njengoba kungenzeka.
It will have to be done immediately.	Kuzofanele kwenziwe ngokushesha.
I have to get him home quickly and sit down.	Kumelwe ngifike naye ekhaya ngokushesha futhi ngihlale phansi.
Whether this is true or not, is not a question.	Ukuthi lokhu kuyiqiniso noma cha, akuwona umbuzo.
He wanted his parents.	Wayefuna abazali bakhe.
It should be good to know what you want to do.	Kufanele kube kuhle ukwazi ukuthi yini ofuna ukuyenza.
It means nothing to him.	Akusho lutho kuye.
I am happy to help you do your job.	Ngiyajabula ukukusiza wenze umsebenzi wakho.
I said it would happen.	Ngathi kuzokwenzeka.
Lots of water on the floor.	Amanzi amaningi phansi.
Yes, but you should be serious about it.	Yebo, kodwa kufanele uzimisele ngakho.
I wanted to get in.	Bengifuna ukungena.
Small, but beautiful.	Encane, kodwa enhle.
So don't do that.	Ngakho ungakwenzi lokho.
But he did not want to hear.	Kodwa wayengafuni ukuzwa.
Or lie to you.	Noma amanga kuwe.
I do not want problems.	Angifuni izinkinga.
Everything is happening now.	Konke okwenzekayo manje.
He is a boy.	Nguye umfana.
And he still does not know.	Futhi namanje akazi.
For something to happen.	Ukuze kwenzeke okuthile.
Your work is really good.	Muhle ngempela umsebenzi wakho.
Now, enough questions.	Manje, imibuzo eyanele.
Up or down.	Phezulu noma phansi.
And that is what he did.	Futhi yilokho akwenza.
Voice only.	Izwi kuphela.
I think that looks better.	Ngicabanga ukuthi lokho kubukeka kungcono.
Is this possible? 	Ingabe lokhu kungenzeka?
And it’s not a new concept either.	Futhi akuwona umqondo omusha futhi.
How beautiful.	Kuhle kanjani.
And he did.	Futhi wakwazi.
I know you're right.	Ngiyazi ukuthi ukhuluma iqiniso.
Lots of money and of course.	Imali eningi futhi kunjalo.
She went well.	Uhambe kahle.
I'll have to talk about it.	Kuzofanele ngikhulume ngakho.
It should not be necessary.	Akufanele kudingeke.
He didn't even know it.	Wayengazi nokuthi.
I don't know what happened there.	Angazi ukuthi kwenzekani lapho.
He did it in college.	Wakwenza ekolishi.
Anything can happen to you.	Kungenzeka noma yini kuwe.
And that should not be difficult.	Futhi lokho akufanele kube nzima.
It will take everyone.	Kuzothatha wonke umuntu.
Slowly in the beginning.	Kancane kancane ekuqaleni.
So far there is no fix for this.	Kuze kube manje akukho ukulungisa lokhu.
She is not at home.	Sengathi akekho ekhaya.
We made a shirt.	Senza ihembe.
Not in his house.	Akukho endlini yakhe.
Me, he said.	Mina, wathi.
He finally opened the door.	Ekugcineni wavula umnyango.
I wanted to quit.	Ngangifuna ukuyeka.
But you made a mistake.	Kodwa wenze iphutha.
I had to think.	Bekufanele ngicabange.
His work should not be so difficult.	Umsebenzi wakhe akufanele ube nzima kangako.
And next year will not be better.	Futhi ngonyaka ozayo ngeke ube ngcono.
At least the problem here.	Okungenani inkinga lapha.
However, he was not in the middle.	Noma kunjalo, akazange abe phakathi.
Still, good news.	Noma kunjalo, indaba enhle.
I like that.	Ngithanda lokho.
But he managed to finish his job.	Kodwa wakwazi ukuqeda umsebenzi wakhe.
I'll be fine.	Ngizoba kahle.
This did not happen.	Lokhu akuzange kwenzeke.
It's good to cry.	Kuhle ukukhala.
I'm sorry.	Ngiyaxolisa .
I just don't see it that way.	Angiboni kanjalo nje.
A little story.	Indaba encane .
The problem really was not that person.	Ngempela inkinga kwakungeyena lowo muntu.
None of us should.	Akekho kithi okufanele akwenze.
Yes, you may actually be busy.	Yebo kungenzeka ukuthi empeleni umatasa.
I don't know what to do.	Angazi ukuthi ngenzeni.
I do not know if this is true or not.	Angazi noma lokhu kuyiqiniso noma cha.
It's hard to picture.	Kunzima isithombe.
It will only take a few hours.	Kuzothatha amahora ambalwa kuphela.
Not very good.	Hhayi kuhle kakhulu.
I should have known.	Bekumele ngazi.
I want to be with you for the rest of my life.	Ngifuna ukuba nawe impilo yami yonke.
He never and never will.	Akakaze futhi ngeke.

That's enough time.	Isikhathi esanele leso.
Some of you are like that.	Okunye kwakho kunjalo.
I can't say what happened.	Angikwazi ukusho ukuthi kwenzekani.
I came here for some work.	Ngize lapha ngomsebenzi othile.
I'm afraid something bad has happened.	Ngesaba ukuthi kukhona okubi okwenzekile.
But I didn't think anything at the time.	Kodwa angizange ngicabange lutho ngaleso sikhathi.
I should have known better.	Bekufanele ngabe ngazi kangcono.
I would like to be friends.	Ngingathanda sibe abangani.
He should have known that, but he didn't.	Bekufanele akwazi lokho, kodwa akakwazanga.
Everyone lives very close together.	Wonke umuntu uhlala eduze kakhulu.
You can't help it.	Ngeke ukwazi ukuzibamba.
He wouldn't do it.	Wayengeke enze.
Maybe even it could be.	Mhlawumbe ngisho kungaba.
Just as he wants.	Njengoba nje efuna.
Anyway, thank you for that.	Noma kunjalo, ngiyabonga ngalokho.

I would like to go again.	Ngingathanda ukuhamba futhi.
I would like to learn more.	Ngingathanda ukufunda okwengeziwe.
No one knows how.	Akekho owaziyo ukuthi kanjani.
I hope food, but who knows what else.	Ngethemba ukudla, kodwa ubani owaziyo ukuthi yini enye.
And he told me all about it.	Futhi wangitshela konke ngakho.
Or you will not be happy.	Noma ngeke ujabule.
He would not have done this without you.	Wayengeke akwenze lokhu ngaphandle kwakho.
One was absent.	Omunye wayengekho.
That's a bad thing about him but you never know.	Yinto embi kakhulu leyo ngaye kodwa ngeke wazi.
I'm sure there is.	Ngiqinisekile kukhona.
I don’t know what to do about it, or about you.	Angazi ukuthi ngenzeni ngakho, noma ngawe.
He did not try to speak.	Akazange azame ukukhuluma.
Unless you wish to try, that's fine.	Ngaphandle uma ufisa ukuzama, kunjalo.
I'm not sure what the problem is.	Angazi kahle ukuthi yini inkinga.
And he did not want anyone else to be with him.	Futhi wayengafuni omunye umuntu abe naye.
He felt his pain.	Wezwa ubuhlungu bakhe.
Tell me that's not true.	Ngitshele ukuthi akulona iqiniso.
Your job is to be his friend.	Umsebenzi wakho ukuba umngane wakhe.

But he would not, of course.	Kodwa wayengeke, impela.
Date and that.	Usuku nokuthi.
One of us.	Omunye wethu.

Just to see what happened.	Ukubona nje ukuthi kwenzekeni.
It has been necessary.	Kuye kwadingeka.

She's scared, and that's another thing.	Uyesaba, futhi lokho okunye futhi.
I would love to hear about that.	Ngingathanda ukuzwa ngalokho.
My story is my story.	Indaba yami indaba yami.
I don't think it could be that way.	Angicabangi ukuthi kungaba njalo.
He did not want me to leave.	Wayengafuni ngihambe.
He will not be able to.	Ngeke akwazi.
And you don't have to.	Futhi awudingi.
But it is too late now.	Kodwa sekwephuzile manje.
I do not know why it happened.	Angazi ukuthi kungani kwenzeka.
And at that moment he knew exactly what to do.	Futhi ngaleso sikhathi wayazi kahle ukuthi kufanele enzeni.
No, you probably won't.	Cha, mhlawumbe ngeke.
He confessed what he had done.	Wavuma akwenzile.
I know it's me.	Ngiyazi yimina.
Or, or, or.	Noma, noma, noma.
You look good, by the way.	Ubukeka kahle, ngendlela.
I know it's not my fault.	Ngiyazi ukuthi akulona iphutha lami.
He had to do something.	Bekufanele enze okuthile.
But not like that.	Kodwa hhayi kanje.
Something in that, maybe.	Okuthile kulokho, mhlawumbe.
You made your choice.	Wenze ukukhetha kwakho.
It's not the same thing at all.	Akuyona into efanayo nhlobo.
I have to do better.	Kufanele ngenze kangcono.
Soon you will need water.	Ngokushesha uzodinga amanzi.
Location, place, place !.	Indawo, indawo, indawo!.
But all is well.	Kodwa konke kuhle.
Too much outside.	Kuningi kakhulu ngaphandle.
I would like to hear music.	Ngingathanda ukuzwa umculo.
That is simply not true.	Lokho akulona iqiniso nje.
That is not for me.	Akukho kimi lokho.
I tried a big house.	Ngazama indlu enkulu.
I had to do something.	Kwadingeka ukwenza okuthile.
She would like to know.	Angathanda ukwazi.
He seemed happy though.	Wayebonakala ejabule kodwa.
But he did not want to buy anything.	Kodwa wayengafuni ukuthenga lutho.
You will not make it better.	Ngeke ukwenze kube ngcono.
Maybe tomorrow evening.	Mhlawumbe kusasa kusihlwa.
He stayed hard.	Wahlala kanzima.
Good for me !.	Kuhle kimi!.
You can't control yourself.	Awukwazi ukuzibamba nguwe.
Finally he asked a question.	Ekugcineni wabuza umbuzo.
That's a lot of money.	Imali encane impela leyo.
Everyone knows this to be true.	Wonke umuntu uyazi ukuthi lokhu kuyiqiniso.
He walked to his car.	Wahamba waya emotweni yakhe.
But even.	Kodwa noma.
I arrived late for work.	Ngifike sekwephuzile emsebenzini.
I don't think why.	Angicabangi ukuthi kungani.
Yes you will.	Yebo uzohlala.
I would like one.	Ngingathanda eyodwa.
He got right there.	Wafika khona lapho.
Instead be present for now.	Kunalokho ube khona okwamanje.
You cannot log in.	Awukwazi ukungena.
He says he should talk to me.	Uthi kumele akhulume nami.
How you plan to do this.	Uhlela ukwenza kanjani lokhu.
He could not go to work.	Akakwazanga ukuya emsebenzini.
People, not so much.	Abantu, hhayi kakhulu.
He may even want to do that.	Angase afune ngisho nalokho.
And yes, yes.	Futhi yebo, yebo.
I wonder about that.	Ngiyazibuza ngalokho.
None of you here.	Akukho kwakho lapha.
No, he wants to eat, he says.	Cha, ufuna ukudla, uthi.
I am very happy to see this.	Ngijabule kakhulu ukubona lokhu.
So he did not say much to her.	Ngakho akazange akhulume kakhulu kuye.
I don't like to talk about myself.	Angithandi ukukhuluma ngami.
I'm glad you did so well.	Ngiyajabula ukuthi wenze kahle kakhulu.
Or at least it should be.	Noma okungenani kufanele kube.
But for now we have to go.	Kodwa okwamanje kumele sihambe.
Just you.	Wena nje.
I don't know if this is him.	Angazi noma nguyena lo.
I would like to read what you have to say.	Ngingathanda ukufunda ukuthi uthini.
He is more afraid than you.	Wesaba kakhulu kunawe.
Or a cat.	Noma ikati.
I want you to stay with me.	Ngifuna uhlale nami.
I am the only mother here.	Yimina ngedwa umama lapha.
And be beautiful.	Futhi ube muhle.
What a thing.	Yini into.
But it's hard for me to see it at night.	Kodwa kunzima kimi ukukubona ebusuku.
As you well know.	Njengoba wazi kahle.
I thought a lot.	Ngicabange kakhulu.
Everyone already knows about this.	Wonke umuntu uyazi ngalokhu kakade.
Now he will go with us.	Manje uzohamba nathi.
What to do, what to do.	Okufanele ukwenze, okufanele ukwenze.
He knew he looked good.	Wayazi ukuthi wayebukeka kahle.
Same thing, anyway.	Into efanayo, noma kanjani.
And, no it is not.	Futhi, cha akunjalo.
He fears the worst.	Wesaba okubi kakhulu.
That will happen to you.	Lokho kuzokwenzeka kuwe.
Unless he knew.	Ngaphandle kokuthi wayazi.
Not here though.	Hhayi lapha kodwa.
But he may have it.	Kodwa angase abe nakho.
He took a moment.	Wathatha isikhashana.
He wanted to talk to you very badly.	Wayefuna ukukhuluma nawe kabi kakhulu.
You can't say that.	Awukwazi ukusho ngalokho.
He told us to do it together.	Wathi sikwenze ndawonye.
If the idea is really good, you will win, at least in the end.	Uma umbono muhle ngempela, uzowina, okungenani ekugcineni.
Well, maybe not.	Kulungile, mhlawumbe akunjalo.
He’s just as good, maybe.	Muhle kanye, mhlawumbe.
He doesn't want to go out.	Akafuni ukuphuma.
I asked anyway.	Ngabuza kunjalo.
And I can't figure out why.	Futhi angikwazi ukuthola ukuthi kungani kunjalo.
About three years.	Cishe iminyaka emithathu.
I just want to do a job.	Ngifuna nje ukwenza umsebenzi.
And maybe that's it.	Futhi mhlawumbe yilokho.
Maybe he couldn't talk to you.	Mhlawumbe akakwazanga ukukhuluma nawe.
That is a gift.	Isipho leso.
You need to get out of here.	Udinga ukuphuma lapha.
He looked bad in the room.	Wabuka kabi ekamelweni.
I am not sure about this.	Angikwazi kahle lokhu.
But just before we did, that is what happened.	Kodwa ngaphambi nje kokuba senze kanjalo, yilokho okwenzeka.
He's just worried about you.	Ukhathazekile ngawe nje.
I never talked about it.	Angizange ngikhulume ngakho.
Now you.	Manje wena.
Beer, he says.	Ubhiya, usho.
She's worried about me.	Ukhathazekile ngami.
Really bad idea.	Umbono omubi ngempela.
I really can't do anything about it.	Impela angikwazi ukwenza lutho ngayo.
Maybe not tomorrow.	Mhlawumbe hhayi kusasa.
I want to stop this for once.	Ngifuna ukuyeka lokhu kube kanye.
This became clear little by little.	Lokhu kwacaca kancane kancane.
That's your life now.	Impilo yakho leyo manje.
You have your time.	Unesikhathi sakho.
He knew better than that.	Wayazi kangcono kunalokho.
She finally had a son.	Ekugcineni wathola indodana.
I just can't work like that.	Angikwazi nje ukusebenza kanjalo.
One good thing.	Into eyodwa enhle.
But this is not the case at all.	Kodwa lokhu akunjalo neze.
I just couldn't get into it.	Angikwazanga nje ukungena kukho.
But that is not really the case.	Kodwa lokho akunjalo ngempela.
The question did not come up.	Umbuzo awuzange ufike.
And so this.	Futhi ngakho lokhu.
He thought of the time.	Wacabanga isikhathi.
Bad boy at school.	Umfana omubi esikoleni.
I'm sorry this afternoon.	Ngiyaxolisa ngale ntambama.
But, it can be difficult.	Kodwa, kungase kube nzima.
I have to tell you the truth.	Kufanele ngikutshele iqiniso.
That's exactly what it should be.	Yilokho kanye okufanele kube njalo.
He did not give his name.	Akazange asho igama lakhe.
Something happened to you.	Kukhona okwenzekile kuwe.
Or very early.	Noma ekuseni kakhulu.
We need a picture.	Sidinga isithombe.
It is very difficult to walk now.	Kunzima kakhulu ukuhamba manje.
But I'm happy this time, really.	Kodwa ngiyajabula ngalesi sikhathi, ngempela.
Maybe he didn't want to talk about it.	Mhlawumbe wayengafuni ukukhuluma ngakho.
I knew one.	Ngangazi omunye.
I wonder why this is.	Kazi kungani lokhu.
How wonderful that would be.	Kungaba kuhle kanjani lokho.
She is not your mother.	Akuyena umama wakho.
You don't want to make a story out of yourself.	Awufuni ukwenza indaba ngawe.
You are working on a phone.	Usebenza ucingo.
But that is not a new approach.	Kodwa leyo akuyona indlela entsha.
But there you will be wrong.	Kodwa lapho uzobe unephutha.
I didn't want to hear about it.	Ngangingafuni ukuzwa ngakho.
I have never spoken to him before or to his father.	Angikaze ngikhulume naye ngaphambili noma ubaba wakhe.
I know that should be difficult.	Ngiyazi ukuthi lokho kufanele kube nzima.
Or maybe always.	Noma mhlawumbe njalo.
It will be so.	Uzoba njalo.
Not everyone, by the way.	Akuwona wonke umuntu, ngendlela.
But you can't say.	Kodwa awukwazi ukusho.
It has not been helpful, of course.	Akuzange kube usizo, kunjalo.
You will be wrong.	Uzobe unephutha.
You will have to go.	Kuzodingeka uhambe.
And now my parents.	Futhi manje abazali bami.
He must know that.	Kuzomele akwazi lokho.
Hopefully tomorrow will be better.	Ngethemba ukuthi kusasa kuzoba ngcono.
Something must have happened.	Kumelwe ukuba kukhona okwenzekile.
He really should.	Ngempela kufanele enze njalo.
He speaks to us like this.	Ekhuluma nathi kanje.
I know what I mean.	Ngiyazi ukuthini.
I think that's a big deal.	Ngicabanga ukuthi yinto enkulu leyo.
It seems right to me.	Kubonakala sengathi kulungile kimi.
I want him to talk.	Ngifuna akhulume.
It can't be any other.	Ngeke kube okunye.
Obviously not true.	Kusobala akulona iqiniso.
But only once.	Kodwa kanye kuphela.
You are alone now.	Uwedwa manje.
So not only to do.	Ngakho hhayi kuphela ukwenza.
She wanted her baby.	Wayefuna ingane yakhe.
And you should get one, too.	Futhi kufanele uthole eyodwa, futhi.
I don't think anything else.	Angicabangi enye into.
He also knew when.	Wayazi nokuthi nini.
There is truth in this.	Kukhona iqiniso kulokhu.
But there is no need to do this.	Kodwa asikho isidingo sokwenza lokhu.
Making driving very difficult.	Ukwenza ukushayela kube nzima kakhulu.
I know where you are going.	Ngiyazi lapho uya khona.
He did not know who the father was.	Wayengazi ukuthi ubani ubaba.
He would love to see you.	Angathanda ukukubona.
Now everything was clear.	Manje konke kwacaca.
He has been gone all day.	Uhambe usuku lonke.
It is not just a choice.	Akukhona nje ukukhetha.
I want to see you now.	Ngifuna ukukubona manje.
Down and slowly.	Phansi futhi kancane.
That's a really good thing.	Yinto enhle ngempela leyo.
One knows perfectly well.	Umuntu uyazi ngokuphelele.
That could be the only thing.	Kungaba yilokho kuphela.
He wanted to stay with you.	Wayefuna ukuhlala nawe.
He speaks ill.	Ukhuluma kabi.
He felt alone.	Wazizwa eyedwa.
And sometimes to do.	Futhi ngezinye izikhathi ukwenza.
But my job is to say something, anything.	Kodwa umsebenzi wami ukusho okuthile, noma yini.
Everything is very true.	Konke kuyiqiniso kakhulu.
And he apparently did not.	Futhi kubonakala sengathi akazange.
By the way, you will too.	Ngendlela, nawe uzokwenza.
But you don’t need to take my word for it.	Kodwa awudingi ukuthatha izwi lami ngakho.
Who do you think you should do.	Ocabanga ukuthi kufanele ukwenze.
If he only knew what was really going on.	Ukube wayazi ukuthi kwenzakalani ngempela.
He wants to leave the city.	Ufuna ahambe edolobheni.
He thought a lot.	Wayecabanga kakhulu.
Mom knows.	Umama uyazi.
I should have been here.	Bekufanele ngabe ngilapha.
More about it later.	Okuningi ngakho kamuva.
It could be that person.	Kungenzeka ukuthi lowo muntu.
You must be kidding me.	Kumele ngabe udlala ngami.
Tell his family.	Tshela umndeni wakhe.
Just one problem.	Inkinga eyodwa nje.
Maybe with this.	Mhlawumbe nalokhu.
I think so, anyway.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kunjalo, noma kunjalo.
It is very difficult, even if you do not know how to cook.	Kunzima kakhulu, noma awazi ukupheka.
Obviously, you are a boy.	Ngokusobala, nguwe umfana.
This is a way to do harm.	Lena indlela yokwenza ingozi.
You will know everything.	Uzokwazi konke.
Not a big problem, but a problem.	Akuyona inkinga enkulu, kodwa inkinga.
We should all be friends.	Sonke kufanele sibe abangane.
I think you need to come home.	Ngicabanga ukuthi udinga ukuza ekhaya.
But it is not !.	Kodwa akunjalo!.
He did it very few times.	Wakwenza izikhathi ezimbalwa kakhulu.
And some books, some clothes.	Futhi ezinye izincwadi, ezinye izingubo.
I will and you must go.	Ngizokwenza futhi kufanele uhambe.
Yes, he wanted more.	Yebo, wayefuna okwengeziwe.
This too is not true.	Lokhu nakho akulona iqiniso.
He never told me anything.	Akakaze angitshele lutho.
Stop college.	Yeka ekolishi.
Or he may not want to talk about it.	Noma kungenzeka ukuthi akafuni ukukhuluma ngayo.
He does not have a car.	Akanayo imoto.
True enough too.	Iqiniso ngokwanele futhi.
It had to be someone else.	Kwakufanele kube omunye umuntu.
This should have been easy.	Lokhu bekufanele kube lula.
That's the test.	Yilokho ukuhlolwa.
I am very happy to do that.	Ngijabule kakhulu ngokwenza kanjalo.
Definitely nothing to play or do.	Nakanjani lutho ukudlala noma ukwenza.
I am going to a party.	Ngiya ephathini.
from the beginning.	kusukela ekuqaleni.
He tried to see better and got more.	Wazama ukubona kangcono futhi wathola okwengeziwe.
I always like to make sure.	Ngihlale ngithanda ukwenza isiqiniseko.
This he must do.	Lokhu kumele akwenze.
But there will be something.	Kodwa kuzoba khona okuthile.
My spirit in him.	Umoya wami kuye.
Just a shirt.	Ihembe nje.
That's right.	Khona lapho okufanele.
It's hard to do that.	Kunzima ukwenza lokho.
I'm talking about work.	Ngikhuluma ngomsebenzi.
He doesn't know about me.	Akazi ngami.
Anyway, here I am.	Noma kunjalo, ngilapha.
House.	Indlu.
And she felt it too.	Futhi naye wazizwa.
I'm sorry, but you did.	Ngiyaxolisa, kodwa ukhona.
How did this happen? 	Kwenzeka kanjani lokhu?
You need to go home.	Udinga ukuya ekhaya.
He soon knew better.	Ngokushesha wayazi kangcono.
We need to play well.	Sidinga ukudlala kahle.

We cannot continue.	Asikwazi ukuqhubeka.
And this time.	Futhi lesi sikhathi.
But not the picture.	Kodwa hhayi isithombe.
I mean, well.	Ngisho, kahle.
You are lying there and you are there.	Ulele lapho futhi ukhona.
We will not do this.	Ngeke sikwenze lokhu.
He rarely does.	Akavamile ukwenza.
This will probably take a really long time.	Lokhu cishe kuzothatha isikhathi eside ngempela.
But he said, 'No, he will not go with me.	Kodwa wathi, cha, ngeke ahambe nami.
I wanted to tell you that.	Bengifuna ukukutshela lokho.
Or that something is wrong.	Noma ukuthi kukhona iphutha.
We can't get help anywhere.	Asikwazi ukuthola usizo noma kuphi.
I mean, this is probably the best way.	Ngisho, lena cishe indlela engcono kakhulu.
You know you know he did it.	Uyazi ukuthi uyazi ukuthi wakwenza.
He did that to me, before.	Wakwenza lokho kimi, ngaphambili.
But I think so.	Kodwa ngicabanga kanjalo.
But not too fast.	Kodwa hhayi ngokushesha kakhulu.
You need more.	Udinga okuningi.
I do not like what is happening here.	Angikuthandi okwenzeka lapha.
It is better to know.	Kungcono ukwazi.
But it seems that he never did that.	Kodwa kubonakala sengathi akakaze akwenze lokho.
I don't think it will be so.	Angicabangi ukuthi kuzoba njalo.
But maybe that is not a good idea.	Kodwa mhlawumbe akuwona umqondo omuhle.
It should be so for now.	Kufanele kube njalo okwamanje.
My father came home.	Ubaba wafika ekhaya.
I'm asking for something small.	Ngicela into encane.
No one knows how you got there.	Akekho owaziyo ukuthi ufike kanjani lapho.
I want to die, but I don't.	Ngifuna ukufa, kodwa akunjalo.
That seems like a lot.	Lokho kubonakala sengathi kuningi.
I really want to be his friend.	Ngifuna ngempela ukuba umngane wakhe.
The doctor thought for a moment.	Udokotela wacabanga isikhashana.
He offered help.	Wanikeza usizo.
I can't say anything yet.	Angisakwazi ukusho lutho okwamanje.
I don't see why.	Angiboni ukuthi kungani.
Another stayed with us for a while.	Omunye wahlala nathi isikhashana.
Everything is there.	Konke kukhona.
Now what's new.	Manje yini entsha.
He didn't, he really didn't.	Akazange, ngempela akazange.
Thank you !.	Ngiyabonga!.
Alone when you read.	Uwedwa lapho ufunda.
He may be now.	Angase abe manje.
Still, almost.	Noma kunjalo, cishe.
Dad will be back and you will need to come in.	Ubaba uzobuya futhi uzodinga ukungena.
All the time, actually.	Ngaso sonke isikhathi, empeleni.
He wanted to go to work.	Wayefuna ukuya emsebenzini.
But my father died.	Kodwa ubaba washona.
He is determined.	Uzimisele.
Your mother will go with you.	Umama wakho uzohamba nawe.

He likes to make friends.	Uthanda ukwenza abangani.
I make energy.	Ngenza amandla.
I could not do anything wrong.	Angikwazanga ukwenza into embi.
I came to him today.	Ngifike kuye namuhla.
He likes to be in the middle.	Uthanda ukuba phakathi.
However, it will be a very long time.	Noma kunjalo, kuzoba isikhathi eside impela.
He is here with me.	Ulapha nami.
Not me.	Akuyena mina.
You are always better.	Uhlale ungcono wena.
It is possible though.	Kungenzeka kodwa.
That's how he got here.	Wafika kanjalo lapha.
Not after.	Hhayi ngemva .
And it should too.	Futhi kufanele nawe.
So he would be.	Ngakho wayezoba njalo.
But she could not find a job.	Kodwa akazange akwazi ukuthola umsebenzi.
I want a baby.	Ngifuna ingane.
I am very happy so far.	Ngijabule kakhulu kuze kube manje.
I did not want to die.	Ngangingafuni ukufa.
Themba sat next to him.	UThemba wahlala eduze kwakhe.
I just know this.	Ngiyazi nje lokhu.
I'm trying to find the best way.	Ngizama ukuthola indlela engcono kakhulu.
At last she looks happy.	Ekugcineni ubukeka ejabule.
I can't tell you what.	Angikwazi ukukutshela ukuthini.
It could be tonight.	Kungaba namhlanje ebusuku.
I just don't want to.	Angifuni nje.
That's it.	Yinto leyo.

Of course, the party.	Kunjalo, iphathi.
I like questions.	Ngithanda imibuzo.

His eyes mean everything.	Amehlo akhe asho yonke into.
That could be tomorrow.	Lokho kungaba kusasa.
So, this happens.	Ngakho, lokhu kwenzeka.
We did it our way.	Senze ngendlela yethu.
He will have to try again.	Kuzodingeka azame futhi.

Walking for a while.	Ehamba isikhashana.
Years, years, years.	Iminyaka, iminyaka, iminyaka.

But what a name.	Kodwa yini igama.
Yes my answer.	Yebo impendulo yami.
I just wanted you to think about that.	Bengifuna nje ucabange lokho.
Not a lie.	Hhayi amanga.

So maybe that's why.	Ngakho mhlawumbe yingakho.
And do this every month.	Futhi lokhu ukwenza njalo ngenyanga.
But don't do it again.	Kodwa ungakwenzi futhi.
At least we know.	Okungenani siyazi.
Not too much travel for me.	Hhayi ukuhamba kakhulu kimi.
I wanted to be a doctor, not a teacher.	Ngangifuna ukuba udokotela, hhayi uthisha.
Play with it.	Ukudlala ngayo.
It is very nice to sleep there.	Kuhle kakhulu ukulala lapho.
He didn't want her to know yet.	Wayengafuni ukuthi azi okwamanje.
Do it again quickly, completely.	Ukwenze futhi ngokushesha, ngokuphelele.

Your family is here.	Umndeni wakho ulapha.
For a better life.	Ukuze uthole impilo engcono.
I said no, a little.	Ngathi cha, kancane.
That's not a vision, that's true.	Lokho akuwona umbono, lokho kuyiqiniso.
So much for this week.	Kuningi kuleli sonto.

But you must be willing to make a mistake.	Kodwa kufanele uzimisele ukwenza iphutha.
This had to be done.	Lokhu kwakufanele kwenziwe.
Danger, perhaps.	Ingozi, mhlawumbe.
There is no time to do that.	Asikho isikhathi sokwenza lokho.
Yes he readily agreed.	Yebo wavuma ngokushesha.

Good to see this.	Kuhle ukubona lokhu.
This is happening all over the world.	Lokhu kwenzeka emhlabeni wonke.

You know nothing about yourself.	Awazi lutho wena.
Tonight your choice.	Namuhla ebusuku ukukhetha kwakho.
I just wanted you to know.	Bengifuna wazi nje.
Except maybe him.	Ngaphandle mhlawumbe yena.
Or do we.	Noma senze.
Now he could not do anything right.	Manje akakwazanga ukwenza lutho kahle.
Or maybe he did it but he never told me.	Noma mhlawumbe wenza ngakho kodwa akakaze angitshele.
Tom, he thought.	UTom, wacabanga.
But okay, okay.	Kodwa kulungile, kulungile.
This is as true as it happens.	Lokhu kuyiqiniso njengoba kwenzeka.

However, he did not make any noise.	Noma kunjalo, akazange enze umsindo.
He will not know this.	Angeke akwazi lokhu.
He is a bad teacher.	Unguthisha kabi.
He could not say anything.	Wayengeke akwazi ukusho lutho.
Today maybe not.	Namuhla mhlawumbe akunjalo.
I think the same way.	Ngicabanga ngendlela efanayo.
Maybe it's better that way.	Mhlawumbe kungcono kanjalo.
This may be helpful.	Lokhu kungase kube usizo.
Not crying.	Hhayi ukukhala.
In the city at least.	Edolobheni okungenani.
This could be better.	Lokhu kungaba ngcono.
There must be a book about it.	Kumelwe kube khona incwadi ekhuluma ngakho.
To do something.	Ukuze wenze okuthile.
Maybe that's why he did so well.	Mhlawumbe yingakho enze kahle kangaka.

This is a wonderful time.	Lesi sikhathi esihle kakhulu.
It must be done, it must be done.	Kumele kwenziwe, kufanele kwenziwe.
Or, probably, it is not.	Noma, cishe, akunjalo.

You feel like you are eating lunch.	Uzizwa sengathi udla isidlo sasemini.
I said maybe.	Ngathi mhlawumbe.

I don't really want to talk about it.	Angifuni ngempela ukukhuluma ngakho.
He might be a good friend.	Angase abe umngane omuhle kakhulu.
Are you ?.	Nguwe?.
Why did this happen? 	Kungani lokhu kwenzeka?
Whatever anyone says.	Noma ngabe ubani uthini.
I think that's great.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kuhle kakhulu lokho.
Also, he knew he had to do it right away.	Futhi, wayazi ukuthi kufanele akwenze ngokushesha.
It's not my money.	Akuyona imali yami.
Not only that.	Angithi nje.
But this is not our story.	Kodwa lena akuyona indaba yethu.
You cannot live here alone.	Awukwazi ukuhlala lapha wedwa.
That, perhaps, so far.	Lokho, mhlawumbe, kuze kube manje.
It would only be a good thing.	Kungaba yinto enhle kuphela.
Her father did not.	Ubaba wakhe akazange.
He is not your family.	Akayena umndeni wakho.
Or this afternoon.	Noma namhlanje ntambama.
But it made my job very difficult.	Kodwa wenze umsebenzi wami waba nzima kakhulu.
Not at all here.	Akunjalo neze lapha.
You have to go with you.	Kufanele uhambe nawe.
This seems plausible.	Lokhu kubonakala kuzwakala.
You want so much.	Ufuna kakhulu.
But he will not go.	Kodwa ngeke ahambe.
My father would not do anything wrong.	Ubaba ubengeke enze into embi.
I never really thought about it.	Angizange ngempela ngicabange ngakho.
No friend.	Akekho umngane.
That's great.	Lokho kakhulu.
I hope you deserve something.	Ngethemba ukuthi kufanele okuthile.
So, he is.	Ngakho, nguye.
I'm so scared, almost.	Ngesaba kanjalo, cishe.
Well, that's me, he thought.	Yebo, yimi lowo, wacabanga.
This could be his response.	Lokhu kungaba impendulo yakhe.
I can't sleep alone.	Angikwazi ukulala ngedwa.
He said he could not get out immediately.	Wathi akakwazi ukuphuma ngokushesha.
And you want more too.	Futhi ufuna okwengeziwe futhi.
He does not like to play outside.	Akathandi ukudlala ngaphandle.
I will not do that to us.	Ngeke ngikwenze lokho kithi.
I don't even remember why.	Angisakhumbuli nokuthi kungani.
One cannot know something that does not exist.	Umuntu angeke azi into engekho.
I never told you this.	Angikaze ngikutshele lokhu.
It would be a very good thing for me.	Kungaba into enhle kakhulu kimi.
Good father.	Ubaba omuhle.
He tried anyway.	Wazama noma kunjalo.
No, no, that's fine.	Cha, cha, kulungile.
I just didn’t think this was going to happen.	Angizange nje ngicabange ukuthi lokhu kuzokwenzeka.
I need you to go for a while.	Ngidinga ukuthi uhambe isikhashana.
This is life.	Impilo lena.
She felt very happy now.	Wazizwa ejabule kakhulu manje.
He pretends to know.	Wenza sengathi uyazi.
But that can be very difficult.	Kodwa lokho kungaba nzima kakhulu.
And I'm very happy too.	Futhi ngijabule kakhulu futhi.
You did everything right.	Wenze konke kahle.
I said yes absolutely.	Ngathi yebo ngokuphelele.
Well, of course.	Kuhle, kunjalo.
You want to know your performance.	Ufuna ukwazi ukusebenza kwakho.
I was thinking of my father.	Bengicabanga ubaba.
It will be like this.	Kuzoba kanje.
He will not come to the meeting.	Ngeke eze emhlanganweni.
That could be your way now.	Kungaba indlela yakho lokho manje.
Just a friend, that's all.	Umngane nje, yilokho kuphela.
I'm not sure what happened, or what he did.	Angiqiniseki ukuthi kwenzekani, noma wenzeni.
He doesn't even have a bicycle.	Akanalo ngisho ibhayisikili.
And he went out.	Futhi waphuma.
My father did not.	Ubaba akazange.
He would not live in the city.	Wayengeke ahlale edolobheni.
He was less visible before.	Wayengabonakali kangako ngaphambili.
Everyone is here, in one place.	Wonke umuntu ulapha, endaweni eyodwa.
I'm really happy for you.	Empeleni ngijabule ngawe.
She started to cry.	Waqala ukukhala.
But this can be difficult.	Kodwa lokhu kungaba nzima.
So I heard.	Ngakho ngizwe.
So do you, perhaps.	Kunjalo nawe, mhlawumbe.
I wish every day that my mother came back.	Ngifisa nsuku zonke ukuthi umama abuye.
I can't talk to you right now.	Angikwazi ukukhuluma nawe manje.
He speaks hard.	Ukhuluma kanzima.
Everyone tries to do his best.	Wonke umuntu uzama ukwenza okusemandleni akhe.
He was amazed at what it looked like.	Wamangala ukuthi kubonakala kanjani.
Please take me home.	Ngicela uhambe nami ekhaya.
Soon he can't do that.	Ngokushesha akakwazi ukwenza kanjalo.
It should be food.	Kufanele kube ukudla.
I hope you did.	Ngethemba ukuthi ukwenzile.
It would certainly be good to get help.	Impela kungaba kuhle ukuthola usizo.
Maybe that one, too.	Mhlawumbe lowo, naye.
To have my family now.	Ukuze ngibe nomndeni wami manje.
He knows he can't live alone in this.	Uyazi ukuthi ngeke akwazi ukuphila yedwa kulokhu.
And he did something about it.	Futhi wenza okuthile ngakho.
And no one.	Futhi akukho muntu.
He wanted to end this.	Wayefuna ukuqeda lokhu.
This is not true at all.	Lokhu akulona iqiniso nhlobo.
It can be just wind.	Kungaba umoya nje.
Sounds good enough.	Kubonakala kulungile ngokwanele.
He has to talk to her.	Kuzomele akhulume naye.
This morning.	Namuhla ekuseni .
A few days is not a problem.	Izinsuku ezimbalwa akuyona inkinga.
My mother did it, too.	Umama wakwenza, naye.
Because, because, because.	Ngoba, ngoba, ngoba.
I think about it every day, every night.	Ngicabanga ngakho nsuku zonke, njalo ebusuku.
I'm trying to think now.	Ngizama ukucabanga manje.
He went to college, and he lives right now.	Waya ekolishi, futhi uhlala khona manje.
Anywhere, recently.	Noma kuphi, muva nje.
And every day.	Futhi njalo nsuku zonke.
It will be a good thing.	Kuzoba yinto enhle.
You know where you are going.	Uyazi lapho uya khona.
Yes it had to happen.	Yebo kwakufanele kwenzeke.
I feel bad all the time.	Ngizizwa kabi ngaso sonke isikhathi.
You felt completely alone.	Wazizwa uwedwa ngokuphelele.
He stayed that way for days.	Wahlala enjalo izinsuku.
Things, not so much.	Izinto, hhayi kakhulu.
Flowers, of course.	Izimbali, kunjalo.
Later, he said.	Kamuva, wathi.
He did not want to go in at all.	Wayengafuni nhlobo ukungena.
That or, that or.	Lokho noma, lokho noma.
But my car.	Kodwa imoto yami.
He could not say exactly why.	Akakwazanga ukusho kahle ukuthi kungani.
He knows everything about me now.	Wazi konke ngami manje.
Money is just not there.	Imali ayikho nje.
But we are not in a restaurant.	Kodwa asikho endaweni yokudlela.
But it can also be a problem.	Kodwa futhi kungase kube inkinga.
And once at home.	Futhi kanye ekhaya.
I told you that.	Ngikutshele ukuthi .
Now that is not such a good idea.	Manje lowo akuwona umqondo omuhle kangako.
That's my way.	Indlela yami leyo.
That would not be too difficult.	Lokho angeke kube nzima kakhulu.
He made it happen.	Wakwenza kwenzeka.
Maybe there is something he can do.	Mhlawumbe kukhona angakwenza.
In fact, anything is possible.	Empeleni, konke kungenzeka.
But it had to happen.	Kodwa kwakudingeka kwenzeke.
She's so beautiful, so beautiful.	Muhle kakhulu, muhle kakhulu.
And maybe.	Futhi mhlawumbe .
Good, but good.	Kuhle, kodwa kuhle.
This is the correct answer.	Lena impendulo efanele.
It happened before.	Kwenzeka ngaphambilini.
I have not been there in a long time.	Angizange ngibe lapho isikhathi eside.
He did not want to do that.	Wayengafuni ukwenza kanjalo.
It had to be all or nothing.	Kwakufanele kube konke noma lutho.
There is a picture.	Kukhona isithombe.
I want to quit too.	Nami ngifuna ukuyeka.
I didn't want to think about why.	Ngangingafuni ukucabanga ukuthi kungani.
Not a book or anything.	Hhayi incwadi noma lutho.
Now, and don't do it.	Manje, futhi ungakwenzi.
He never could get in.	Akakaze akwazi ukungena.
It will not be a big deal.	Ngeke kube yinto enkulu.
He can't get in the car.	Akakwazi ukungena emotweni.
The gun can't.	Isibhamu asikwazi.
Nothing bad, nothing bad.	Akukho okubi, akukho okubi.
I want to do it all.	Ngifuna ukukwenza konke.
Something has to happen.	Kukhona okumele kwenzeke.
Just a little bit for now.	Kancane nje okwamanje.
He did not want to sleep.	Wayengafuni ukulala.
People.	Abantu .
He knows everything you need to know.	Wazi konke okumele ukwazi.
He felt surprised.	Wezwa emangele.
All behind me.	Konke ngemuva kwami.
I know you want to.	Ngiyazi uyafuna.
He wants everything as quickly as possible.	Ufuna yonke into ngokushesha ngokushesha okukhulu.
I wouldn’t consider driving there myself.	Ngeke ngicabange ukushayela lapho mina.
I think that is obviously the case.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kunjalo ngokusobala.
You too in this too.	Nawe kulokhu futhi.
He walks with it.	Uhamba ngayo.
I never got to the end.	Angikaze ngifike ekugcineni.
And marriage is marriage.	Futhi umshado umshado.
In one way or another.	Ngendlela eyodwa noma enye.
No, not tomorrow.	Cha, hhayi kusasa.
Not just too big.	Hhayi nje enkulu kakhulu.
Not sound, not sound.	Hhayi umsindo, hhayi umsindo.
I have always thought that everyone knows this.	Bengilokhu ngicabanga ukuthi wonke umuntu uyakwazi lokhu.
But you do not have to.	Kodwa akudingekile ukuba wenze kanjalo.
But this is not really the case.	Kodwa lokhu akunjalo empeleni.
It will be much harder than that.	Kuzoba nzima kakhulu kunalokho.
Now let me do my job.	Manje ake ngenze umsebenzi wami.
I want a lot of things.	Ngifuna izinto eziningi.
But he felt it.	Kodwa wazizwa.
In the meantime you need to go to work.	Okwamanje udinga ukuya emsebenzini.
I asked when he would be back.	Ngabuza ukuthi uzobuya nini.
This is my choice, no one else.	Lokhu ukukhetha kwami, akekho omunye.
You bought it completely.	Uthenge ngokuphelele.
Because man cannot do it alone.	Ngoba umuntu akakwazi ukukwenza yedwa.
He is only human.	Ungumuntu nje kuphela.
I have never been this way.	Angikaze ngibe kanje.
By doing tomorrow.	Ngokwenza kusasa.
All day and at home.	Usuku lonke futhi ekhaya.
Maybe, something else.	Mhlawumbe, okunye.
He was not all bad.	Wayengeyena wonke omubi.
But this is not the story here.	Kodwa lena akuyona indaba lapha.
He sank down a little.	Washona phansi kancane.
Maybe at least a few months.	Mhlawumbe izinyanga ezimbalwa okungenani.
Large and slow moving.	Enkulu futhi ehamba kancane.
He was surprised that it happened so easily.	Wamangala ukuthi kwenzeka kalula nje.
The food, by the way, is also very good.	Ukudla, ngendlela, nakho kuhle kakhulu.
I do not know anyone.	Angazi nobani.
This is all life.	Impilo yonke le.
But it did not happen at all.	Kodwa kwenzeka nakancane.
I wanted to do something to help.	Bengifuna ukwenza okuthile ukusiza.
We did not do it alone.	Asizange sikwenze sodwa.
It is best to stay longer.	Kuhle kakhulu ukuhlala isikhathi eside.
What to do with food.	Okufanele ukwenze ukudla.
He just wanted his friend back.	Wayefuna nje umngane wakhe abuye.
I would have sat down.	ngabe ngihlala phansi.
It's been almost a week now.	Cishe sekuphele isonto lonke manje.
Everyone needs one.	Wonke umuntu udinga eyodwa.
But just playing with him.	Kodwa ukudlala ngaye kuphela.
And even if he wanted to.	Futhi noma wayefuna.
Slowly, often and how you feel.	Kancane, kaningi nokuthi uzizwa kanjani.
So we need help.	Ngakho sidinga usizo.
To tell exactly what you mean.	Ukutshela kahle ukuthi usho ukuthini.
Many, many times, he went to her.	Izikhathi eziningi, eziningi, waya kuye.
But not in my place.	Kodwa hhayi endaweni yami.
I need to work on this.	Ngidinga ukusebenza kulokhu.
There is music.	Kukhona umculo.
How wonderful it is still.	Yeka ukuthi kuhle kangakanani namanje.
So always.	Ngakho njalo.
Here you can.	Lapha ungakwazi.

I did not have to go alone.	Kwakungafanele ngihambe ngedwa.
I asked for more.	Ngacela okunye.
He asked for my advice.	Wacela iseluleko sami.
If it could be so easy.	Uma kungaba lula kanjalo.
The boy looked everywhere except him.	Umfana wabheka yonke indawo ngaphandle kwakhe.
I also went to him.	Nami ngihambe kuye.
At first, he did not think much of himself.	Ekuqaleni, wayengacabangi kangako ngaye.

He too wanted to know.	Naye wayefuna ukwazi.
But he could not walk.	Kodwa wayengeke akwazi ukuhamba.
I don't think about that.	Angicabangi ngalokho.
No one does that, either.	Akekho owenza lokho, futhi.
It could be a gun.	Kungase kube isibhamu.

And that will be that.	Futhi lokho kuzoba yilokho.
Probably not until now.	Mhlawumbe hhayi kuze kube manje.

Something is happening there.	Kukhona okwenzekayo lapho.
We can't stay here now.	Asikwazi ukuhlala lapha manje.
So that's why you're here.	Ngakho yingakho ulapha.

But he could not help that.	Kodwa akakwazanga ukukusiza lokho.
My job is here.	Umsebenzi wami ulapha.
And not because he was afraid.	Futhi hhayi ngoba wayesaba.
Mistakes and everything.	Amaphutha nakho konke.
The only question will be his life.	Umbuzo kuphela kuzoba impilo yakhe.

Not before, not since.	Hhayi ngaphambili, hhayi kusukela.
Let me just do it.	Ake ngikwenze nje.
We need to talk to you.	Sidinga ukukhuluma nawe.
Looks like I can't choose.	Kubonakala sengathi angikwazi ukukhetha.
But you still can't go there, and stay.	Kodwa namanje awukwazi ukuya lapho, futhi uhlale.
Finding out how much you need may be difficult.	Ukuthola ukuthi udinga malini kungase kube nzima.
So, when it happens, it happens.	Ngakho, uma kwenzeka, kwenzeka.
I think so, and hopefully so.	Ngicabanga kanjalo, futhi ngethemba kanjalo.
That too is a fact.	Nalokho kuyiqiniso.
So he decided to move on.	Ngakho wanquma ukuqhubeka.
Saying the same thing over and over again.	Ukusho into eyodwa kaningi.
That is very difficult.	Lokho kunzima kakhulu.
There is something wrong with it.	Kukhona into embi ngayo.
You know it can be.	Uyazi ukuthi kungaba njalo.
That should be maybe.	Lokho kufanele kube mhlawumbe.
But apparently he was not.	Kodwa ngokusobala wayengekho.
I think about it like this.	Ngicabanga ngakho kanje.
It may be before, during or after.	Kungase kube ngaphambi, phakathi noma ngemva.
A nice little car.	Imoto encane enhle.
Maybe you should think for a moment.	Mhlawumbe kufanele ucabange isikhashana.

He’s not a doctor, really.	Akayena udokotela, empeleni.
We did the same thing over the weekend.	Senze into efanayo ngempelasonto.
It should come first.	Kufanele kube kuqala.
No I'm sorry.	Hhayi mina ngiyaxolisa.
It should be fine, but it is not.	Kufanele kube kuhle, kodwa akunjalo.
That is not true of me.	Akulona iqiniso ngami.
Yes, that is exactly what happened.	Yebo, lokho kwenzeka ngempela.
Everything should be.	Konke kufanele.
You have done a great job.	Wenze umsebenzi omkhulu.
It will happen or not.	Kuzokwenzeka noma cha.
Yet it is said.	Noma kunjalo kuthiwa.
No problem there for me.	Akukho nkinga lapho kimi.
Even when you make a mistake.	Nakho lapho wenza iphutha.
I didn't even think that.	Bengingacabangi nokuthi.
That is what is happening now.	Yilokho okwenzekayo manje.
And that's not all.	Futhi akukhona konke lokho.
You are always reading.	Uhlala ufunda.
Instead, he readily agreed.	Kunalokho, wavuma ngokushesha.
The family sits down.	Umndeni uhlala phansi.
Still he must have thought.	Noma kunjalo kufanele ukuthi wacabanga.
I had to think it through.	Kwadingeka ngicabange kahle.
He said maybe it will be this week.	Uthe mhlawumbe kuzoba kuleli sonto.
If you did, you would never get anywhere.	Uma wenze kanjalo, ubungeke ufike ndawo.
I just need a moment.	Ngidinga isikhashana nje.
The question is it will happen.	Umbuzo uthi kuzokwenzeka.
Why are you here.	Kungani ulapha.
Good work.	Umsebenzi muhle.
Excitedly he spoke to me.	Ejabule wakhuluma nami.
What should he do?	Yini lena okumele ayenze?.
That seems obvious enough.	Lokho kubonakala kusobala ngokwanele.
How to do it.	Ungakwenza kanjani.
It looks like children.	Kubonakala sengathi izingane.
You must go now.	Kumele uhambe manje.
So he sits down at the table again.	Ngakho uhlala etafuleni futhi.
Stay with him.	Uhlale naye.
He never told me how he knew.	Akazange angitshele ukuthi wazi kanjani.
But more is needed.	Kodwa kudingeka okwengeziwe.
You don't even think about it.	Awucabangi ngisho ngakho.
I made mistakes, too.	Ngenza amaphutha, futhi.
She is happy and excited.	Ujabule futhi ujabule.
Eating a little harder.	Ukudla kanzima kancane.
But it is very difficult.	Kodwa kunzima kakhulu.
Always new.	Njalo entsha.
More was needed.	Kwakudingeka okwengeziwe.
No more time.	Asikho isikhathi esengeziwe.
Done at the right time.	Kwenziwe ngesikhathi esihle.
And yet, that seems to be true.	Futhi okwamanje, lokho kubonakala kuyiqiniso.
It has happened all over the world.	Kwenzeke emhlabeni wonke.
I never, never will.	Angikaze, angisoze.
This way, well.	Ngale ndlela, kahle.
And that's all for now.	Futhi yilokho kuphela okwamanje.
Surely one must know something.	Impela umuntu kumele azi okuthile.
I want to go there too.	Nami ngifuna ukuya khona.
He did not think.	Wayengacabangi.
Very, very good work.	Kakhulu, muhle kakhulu umsebenzi.
It can be really hard, very fast.	Kungaba nzima ngempela, ngokushesha okukhulu.
But if you think so, that's fine.	Kodwa uma ucabanga kanjalo, kulungile.
I had to think about that.	Kwadingeka ngicabange ngalokho.
No one knows about it.	Akekho owaziyo ngakho.
I do not have a girlfriend.	Anginayo intombi.
He is here to help.	Ulapha ukuze asize.
And it's time.	Futhi sekuyisikhathi.
I did the very same thing.	Ngenza into efanayo impela.
And he did not speak.	Futhi akazange akhulume.
Tonight, if you want.	Namuhla ebusuku, uma ufuna.
Once a year is fine.	Kanye ngonyaka kulungile.
There is a lot going on in this.	Kuningi okwenzekayo kulokhu.
This should be done alone.	Lokhu kumele kwenziwe uwedwa.
But she does not look happy.	Kodwa akabonakali ejabule.
And we should have that.	Futhi kufanele sibe nalokho.
We must not make this our place.	Akumele senze lokhu kube indawo yethu.
And not a lot of money.	Futhi hhayi imali eningi.
He did not want to talk to her at all.	Wayengafuni nhlobo ukuthi akhulume naye.
But it would be a mistake.	Kodwa kungaba iphutha.
They knew better.	Bengazi kangcono.
Dad tried to make everything easier.	Ubaba wazama ukwenza konke kube lula.
I wanted nothing from him.	Ngangingafuni lutho kuye.
Certainly not.	Impela, akufanele.
I found almost the right answer.	Ngithole cishe impendulo efanele.
And that happened years ago.	Futhi lokho kwenzeka eminyakeni edlule.
But, that's why you want an answer.	Kodwa, yingakho ufuna impendulo.
He will be with us soon.	Uzoba nathi maduze.
And maybe he said it to me.	Futhi mhlawumbe uthe kimi.
I don't really like that.	Angikuthandi kakhulu lokho.
And he got these.	Futhi wathola lezi.
We have made it all easier for you.	Senze konke kube lula kuwe.
I need to tell you about it.	Ngidinga ukukutshela ngakho.
I want to get rid of this quickly.	Ngifuna ukuqeda lokhu ngokushesha.
I thought about it yesterday, while you were away.	Ngicabange ngakho izolo, ngesikhathi uhamba.
I wish you liked that too.	Ngithanda ukuthi nawe uthanda lokho.
You need to do your job.	Udinga ukwenza umsebenzi wakho.
See more.	Ukubona okunye.
But a good idea.	Kodwa umqondo omuhle.
I think that happened to me last night.	Ngicabanga ukuthi lokho kwenzeke kimi izolo ebusuku.
I know it's not your fault.	Ngiyazi ukuthi akulona iphutha lakho.
But not this morning.	Kodwa hhayi namhlanje ekuseni.
He said tonight.	Wathi namuhla ebusuku.
And this is not really true.	Futhi lokhu akulona iqiniso ngempela.
I could not wait to get home.	Angikwazanga ukulinda ukufika ekhaya.
We probably know.	Cishe siyazi.
You've been there a few times.	Ube khona izikhathi ezimbalwa.
He just wanted to stay in bed.	Wayefuna nje ukuhlala embhedeni.
He wanted to quit.	Wayefuna ukuyeka.
At least from the outside.	Okungenani kusukela ngaphandle.
I'm not entirely sure about that.	Angiqiniseki ngokuphelele kulokho.
He knew, he thought.	Wayazi, wacabanga.
I am actually happy with my job.	Empeleni ngijabule ngomsebenzi wami.
There is just so much going on.	Kuningi nje okwenzekayo.
I can't sing, either.	Angikwazi ukucula, nami.
You should never do that.	Akufanele neze ukwenze lokho.
Many times actually.	Izikhathi eziningi empeleni.
And this is another one.	Futhi lena enye.
I go to my room.	Ngiya ekamelweni lami.
When you wish.	Lapho ufisa.
Yes from your time.	Yebo kusukela ngesikhathi sakho.
Sure, that's fine.	Impela, lokho kuhle.
It could be you.	Kungaba uwena lowo.
He was visible.	Wayebonakala .
But you can't have it all.	Kodwa awukwazi ukuba nakho konke.
It is not always a good reason.	Akusona isizathu esihle ngaso sonke isikhathi.
You can do that only if you have the ability.	Ungakwenza lokho kuphela uma unekhono.
And everyone in it.	Futhi wonke umuntu kukho.
I can't remember why, exactly.	Angisakhumbuli ukuthi kungani, impela.
Now this is good.	Manje lokhu kuhle.
Everything may be good enough.	Konke kungase kube kuhle ngokwanele.
That should be long enough, he decided.	Lokho kufanele kube isikhathi eside ngokwanele, wanquma.
It is good to continue.	Kulungile ukuqhubeka.
It has not been a good idea.	Akuzange kube umqondo omuhle.
Now he did not.	Manje akazange.
I couldn't find one big enough.	Angikwazanga ukuthola eyodwa enkulu ngokwanele.
It's time again.	Sekuyisikhathi futhi.
Same car from scratch.	Imoto efanayo kusukela ekuqaleni.
Eating alone tonight.	Ukudla wedwa namhlanje ebusuku.
I couldn’t take much.	Angikwazanga ukuthatha okuningi.
He even said he himself.	Usho ngisho yena.
As you know, this is clearly not true.	Njengoba wazi, lokhu akulona iqiniso ngokusobala.
Thank you always.	Ngiyabonga njalo.
He is your husband.	Uyindoda yakho.
There are errors.	Kukhona amaphutha.
He works really hard.	Usebenza kanzima impela.
Or he thought at first.	Noma wayecabanga ekuqaleni.
With all that, there is no way to do it right.	Nakho konke lokho, ayikho indlela yokwenza kahle.
Not a good thing yet.	Akuyona into enhle kuze kube manje.
He knew anyway.	Wayazi noma kunjalo.
And, you should.	Futhi, kufanele.
In the end she is scared.	Ekugcineni uyesaba.
I have never said such a thing to him.	Angikaze ngisho into enjalo kuye.
I don't know if he saw it or not.	Angazi ukuthi wabona noma cha.
Good too.	Kuhle futhi.
But he also felt it.	Kodwa naye wazizwa.
Very early in the morning.	Ekuseni kakhulu.
Or rather, it will be.	Noma kunalokho, uzoba njalo.
He can play, read or sleep.	Angakwazi ukudlala, ukufunda noma ukulala.
So all is well.	Ngakho konke kuhle.
That's a bad idea.	Umbono omubi lowo.
No one knows except you.	Akekho owaziyo ngaphandle kwakho.
He said that would be a very good idea.	Wathi lowo kungaba umqondo omuhle kakhulu.
I wanted to know all about it.	Ngangifuna ukwazi konke ngakho.
It was not ours.	Kwakungeyena wethu.
Not much time at least.	Hhayi isikhathi esiningi okungenani.
But he did a great job.	Kodwa wenza umsebenzi omkhulu.
My father will do a great job.	Ubaba uzokwenza umsebenzi omkhulu.
But it may be so.	Kodwa kungase kube njalo.
She was going to her house.	Kade eya endlini yakhe.
When he spoke.	Lapho ekhuluma.
He wanted to get out of it, everything.	Wayefuna ukuphuma kukho, konke.
It is very difficult to make a call.	Kunzima kabi ukwenza ucingo.
This can be very difficult.	Lokhu kungaba nzima kakhulu.
All good!.	Konke kuhle!.
Anything similar.	Noma yini efanayo.
My work makes it so.	Umsebenzi wami wenza kube njalo.
Everything should be very good.	Konke kufanele kube kuhle kakhulu.
But this is good for me.	Kodwa lokhu kuhle kimi.
Something happened to me.	Kukhona okwenzekile kimi.
It had to be you.	Kwakufanele kube nguwe.
He said it was okay for him.	Wathi kulungile kuye.
He went in there just doing his job.	Wangena lapho wenza umsebenzi wakhe nje.
I saw something.	Ngibone okuthile.
Yes, for now.	Yebo, okwamanje.
As it happens, that is not my decision.	Njengoba kwenzeka, leso akusona isinqumo sami.
He saw something in me.	Wabona okuthile kimi.
But he made a mistake.	Kodwa wenza iphutha.
And it seems to be the case right now.	Futhi kubonakala kunjalo njengamanje.
I know you want to help.	Ngiyazi ukuthi ufuna ukusiza.
Just a story.	Indaba nje.
At least now we have something to do with it.	Okungenani manje kukhona okumele sikwenze ngakho.
He is, he is, in my home.	Ukhona, ukhona, ekhaya lami.
What to do again.	Okufanele ukwenze futhi.
It's all over now.	Sekuphele konke lokho manje.
I've been thinking about it a lot.	Bengilokhu ngicabanga ngakho kakhulu.
He died on the spot.	Washona khona lapho.
He saw something more.	Wabona okunye okwengeziwe.
I'm really happy about that.	Ngijabule ngempela ngalokho.
Anyone please help.	Noma ubani ngicela asize.
That's her baby.	Ingane yakhe leyo.
Not that he was afraid.	Hhayi ukuthi wayesaba.
I will not think a bit about you.	Ngeke ngicabange kancane ngawe.
Well done, really good job.	Wenze kahle, umsebenzi omuhle impela.
He got there for me.	Wafika lapho kimi.
Before you know it.	Ngaphambi kokuthi wazi.
She is happy about it.	Ujabule ngakho.
I want to be there for everything.	Ngifuna ukuba khona kukho konke.
Not unless you wish.	Hhayi ngaphandle uma ufisa.
But obviously.	Kodwa kusobala.
No major or minor problem.	Ayikho inkinga enkulu kakhulu noma encane.
I wanted to be better than you.	Bengifuna ukuba ngcono kunawe.
The gun went off badly.	Isibhamu sihambe kabi.
And that's exactly it.	Futhi yilokho ngempela.
Let me think.	Ake ngicabange .
You can do that, too.	Ungakwenza lokho, futhi.
I don't know, but you probably know.	Angazi, kodwa mhlawumbe uyazi.
And that's the danger today.	Futhi leyo ingozi namuhla.
Sounds good.	Kubonakala sengathi kuhle.
Alone.	Uwedwa .
Please try again.	Ngicela aphinde.
He made this clear.	Wakwenza kwacaca lokhu.
He is waiting for you.	Ulindele wena.
It could be.	Kungenzeka ukuthi .
Certainly you.	Impela nawe.
He had no reason to do what was right at that time.	Wayengenaso isizathu sokwenza okufanele ngaleso sikhathi.
No, no, no and no.	Cha, cha, cha futhi cha.
That is not just a theory.	Lokho akuwona nje umbono.
He did it well too.	Wakwenza kahle futhi.
He could not make a mistake.	Wayengeke akwazi ukwenza iphutha.
Saying that many times.	Ukusho izikhathi eziningi lokho.
How is that possible? 	Kungenzeka kanjani lokho?
This is not my decision.	Akusona isinqumo sami lesi.
And finally he did.	Futhi ekugcineni wenza.
Wherever he went he felt his spirit go with him.	Lapho eya khona wezwa umoya wakhe uhamba naye.
Just talking bad.	Ukukhuluma kabi nje.
This is always true.	Lokhu kuyiqiniso njalo.
I know what happened.	Ngiyazi ukuthi kwenzekani.
it is not.	akuyona.
That should be better.	Lokho kufanele kube ngcono.
That's just all that happened to you.	Lokho nje konke okwenzeka kuwe.
He wanted to stay for a while.	Wayefuna ukuhlala isikhashana.
And he looked at the police.	Futhi wabheka amaphoyisa.
No, not you, not even.	Cha, hhayi wena, ngisho.
He does everything on time.	Wenza konke ngesikhathi.
Yes, it happened overtime.	Yebo, kwenzeke ngesikhathi esengeziwe.
And he said he didn't know why.	Futhi wathi akazi ukuthi kungani.
So not so much.	Ngakho hhayi kakhulu.
But there is no evil, no evil.	Kodwa akukho okubi, akukho okubi.
Maybe not so much though.	Mhlawumbe hhayi kakhulu kodwa.
He wants to go back to the room.	Ufuna ukubuyela ekamelweni.
This time.	Lesi sikhathi.
We just need to see more.	Sidinga nje ukubona okwengeziwe.
If you are human.	Uma ungumuntu.
He has no other name, and he has no other life.	Akanalo elinye igama, futhi akanayo enye impilo.
I asked how.	Ngabuza ukuthi kanjani.
He went in, did something about it.	Wangena, wenza okuthile ngakho.
Just a door.	Umnyango nje .
He doesn't even have a gun.	Akanaso ngisho isibhamu.
Everything else is fine.	Konke okunye kuhle.
Too much to give up.	Kakhulu ukuyeka.
It is difficult to find such a thing.	Kunzima ukuthola into enjalo.
I tried to get help.	Ngazama ukuthola usizo.
You bought that.	Uthenge lokho.
It is not necessary either.	Akudingekile futhi.
No, you did well.	Cha, wenze kahle.
That's not just me.	Akumina nje lowo.
And no, it's not your fault.	Futhi cha, akulona iphutha lakho.
Work, house, marriage.	Umsebenzi, indlu, umshado.
And do this quickly.	Futhi wenze lokhu ngokushesha.
He did not know how he felt now.	Wayengazi ukuthi uzizwa kanjani manje.
In front of him.	Ngaphambili kwakhe.
My little thing? 	Into yami encane?
Crying badly all day.	Ukukhala kabi usuku lonke.
To tell the truth.	Ukukhuluma iqiniso.
But maybe it shouldn't.	Kodwa mhlawumbe bekungafanele.
It could be this week.	Kungaba kuleli sonto.
That, of course, is not the case.	Lokho, kunjalo, akunjalo.
And this time.	Futhi ngalesi sikhathi.
But I am the only one.	Kodwa yimi kuphela.
That's your opinion, and that's fine.	Lowo umbono wakho, futhi lokho kulungile.
Just taking it all.	Ukuthatha nje konke.
Another of his health.	Enye impilo yakhe.
They say it's a gift.	Bathi isipho.
I speak for myself.	ngikhuluma ngedwa.
You will need to take your time.	Uzodinga ukuthatha isikhathi sakho.
He said he immediately knew this was going to happen.	Uthe ngokushesha wayazi ukuthi kuzokwenzeka lokhu.
At home, she decided.	Ekhaya, wanquma.
I can’t really imagine the reason why.	Angikwazi ngempela ukucabanga isizathu sokuthi kungani.
He also did not want to know.	Naye wayengafuni ukwazi.
Speaking behind me.	Ekhuluma ngemuva kwami.
I wonder if you do.	Ngiyamangala uma wenza kanjalo.
It hasn't been there since.	Akuzange kube khona kusukela lapho.
Not me, he wanted to say, not me.	Hhayi mina, wayefuna ukusho, hhayi mina.
I can't eat much right now.	Angikwazi ukudla okuningi njengamanje.
It may be a few hours.	Kungase kube amahora ambalwa.
I do not know how and why.	Angazi kanjani futhi kungani.
He will not be able to work for a few days.	Ngeke akwazi ukusebenza izinsuku ezimbalwa.
You should consider doing this.	Kufanele ucabange ukwenza lokhu.
Back to me, actually.	Ukubuyela kimi, empeleni.
I want to leave immediately.	Ngifuna ukuhamba ngokushesha.
I wanted to stay with you too.	Nami bengifuna ukuhlala nawe.
I'm not sure how you can do this.	Angiqiniseki ukuthi ungakwenza kanjani lokhu.
There is no such thing.	Ayikho into efanayo.
And well, too.	Futhi kahle, futhi.
He will be back next week.	Uzobuya ngesonto elizayo.
That is exactly the problem.	Yilokho kanye inkinga.
My friend said he wanted to leave at that moment.	Umngane wami uthe ufuna ukuhamba ngaleso sikhathi.
In this case, soon.	Kulokhu, maduze.
The mind wants to feel good.	Umqondo ufuna ukuzwa kahle.
That may be the first time.	Lokho kungase kube okokuqala.
Her clothes, too.	Izingubo zakhe, futhi.
To be happy.	Ukuze ujabule.
And you should not wear shoes.	Futhi akufanele ugqoke izicathulo.
He did, he could.	Wakwenza, wakwazi.
Before anything happens.	Ngaphambi kokuthi kwenzeke noma yini.
That's just my opinion.	Lowo nje umbono wami.
That could be me.	Kungaba yimi lowo.
But I know you well.	Kodwa ngikwazi kahle.
You've been doing too much.	Kade wenza okuningi kakhulu.
I think you are probably very happy.	Ngicabanga ukuthi mhlawumbe ujabule kakhulu.
I think that would be a good idea.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kungaba umqondo omuhle.
But this should not be long.	Kodwa lokhu akufanele kube isikhathi eside.
Now, not another name.	Manje, hhayi elinye igama.
Still he refused.	Noma kunjalo wenqaba.
You need to stop making sense.	Udinga ukuyeka ukwenza umqondo.
I think the music is good.	Ngicabanga ukuthi umculo muhle.
I should have told you, yes.	Bekufanele ngikutshele, yebo.
He is not our person.	Akayena umuntu wethu.
He went, he came.	Wahamba, wafika.
And it may be wrong to get it completely.	Futhi kungase kube into engalungile ukuthola ngokuphelele.
Not always, perhaps.	Hhayi njalo, mhlawumbe.
Something very bad happened here.	Kwenzeke into embi kakhulu lapha.
But in this case, there is nothing to be done.	Kodwa kulokhu akukho okumele kwenziwe.
My mother can't control herself.	Umama akakwazi ukuzibamba.
The meeting did not go well at first.	Umhlangano awuzange uhambe kahle ekuqaleni.
I really can't get out.	Angikwazi ngempela ukuphuma.
He did other things.	Wenza ezinye izinto.
And there is no reason why you can.	Futhi asikho isizathu sokuthi kungani ungakwazi.
I mean a little something.	Ngisho into encane.
It only lasts a day.	Uhlala usuku nje.
I mean great.	Ngisho okukhulu.
Or, something like that.	Noma, into enjalo.
But it did not happen to me.	Kodwa akuzange kwenzeke kimi.
So that's one problem.	Ngakho leyo inkinga eyodwa.
Wherever you go, do it.	Lapho okumele uye khona, wenzeni.
He returned to his desk and sat down.	Wabuyela etafuleni lakhe wahlala.
Not really, really.	Hhayi impela, ngempela.
Coffee on the table.	Ikhofi etafuleni.
But she seemed very happy.	Kodwa wayebonakala ejabule kakhulu.

He sat down at his desk.	Wahlala etafuleni lakhe.
This happened to me.	Lokhu kwenzeka kimi.
He came to the door.	Afike emnyango.
You do the same thing.	Nawe wenza into efanayo.
I feel good though.	Ngizwa kahle kodwa.
Well, you can't.	Kulungile, awukwazi.
Maybe that's true.	Mhlawumbe kuyiqiniso lokho.
That is good for us.	Kuhle lokho kithi.
He didn't talk much about it.	Akazange akhulume kakhulu ngayo.
So he stayed there.	Ngakho wahlala lapho.
I did not want to get out of bed.	Ngangingafuni ukuphuma embhedeni.
I thought long and hard for three days.	Ngacabanga isikhathi eside futhi kanzima izinsuku ezintathu.
Sometimes too long.	Ngezinye izikhathi isikhathi eside kakhulu.
I could see he didn't want to talk here.	Ngabona ukuthi akafuni ukukhuluma lapha.
Everyone thought so, except me.	Wonke umuntu wayecabanga kanjalo, ngaphandle kwami.
And to talk about it.	Futhi ukukhuluma ngakho.
That's right, that's right.	Lokho kuyiqiniso, kunjalo.
He thought it might be him.	Wayecabanga ukuthi kungaba nguye.
One must know the truth.	Umuntu kufanele azi iqiniso.
You have to dress up.	Kumele ugqoke.

I need your help.	Ngicela usizo kuwe.
Yes, he did.	Yebo, wavuma.
But that's why you're here.	Kodwa yingakho ulapha.
He used to go out of town.	Wayevame ukuphuma edolobheni.
He will do it for me.	Uzokwenza kimi.
It started in the morning.	Waqala ekuseni.
I just don’t know how you got there.	Angazi nje ukuthi ufike kanjani lapho.
Bad question.	Umbuzo omubi.
Wrong questions.	Imibuzo engalungile.
You probably know better.	Mhlawumbe wazi kangcono.
Would that be true.	Ngabe kuyiqiniso.
Your cat.	Ikati lakho.
We cannot stop thinking about it.	Asikwazi ukuyeka ukucabanga ngakho.
We can't find that.	Asikwazi ukuthola kanjalo.
He looked up, but not as if he were happy.	Wabheka phezulu, kodwa hhayi sengathi ujabule.
That's fine.	Kuhle kahle.
I think of you all the time.	Ngicabanga ngawe ngaso sonke isikhathi.
There is more, too.	Kukhona okwengeziwe, futhi.
I will never tell anyone about it.	Angisoze ngatshela muntu ngakho.
And at first he was very scared.	Futhi okokuqala wesaba kakhulu.
I do not think so.	Angicabangi .
He wanted to go with her.	Wayefuna ahambe naye.
Yes, good work on this.	Yebo, umsebenzi omuhle kulokhu.
Not to him, of course.	Hhayi kuye, impela.
He’s a kid, he doesn’t think.	Uyingane, akacabangi.
You know there.	Uyazi lapho.
He probably knew everything.	Cishe wayazi yonke into.
So that will take time.	Ngakho lokho kuzothatha isikhathi.
I don't know enough.	Angazi ngokwanele.
No, please do not.	Cha, ngicela ungakwenzi.
He spoke.	Wakhuluma.
He tried everything.	Wazama konke.
His power is restored.	Abuye amandla akhe.
I am very happy, indeed.	Ngijabule kakhulu, impela.
He decided to play with her.	Wanquma ukudlala naye.
This morning she did her best to find out.	Namuhla ekuseni wenze konke okusemandleni akhe ukuthola.
No one outside knows you are here.	Akekho ngaphandle owaziyo ukuthi ulapha.
It is difficult but not dangerous.	Kunzima kodwa akuyona ingozi.
There is a new message.	Kukhona umlayezo omusha.
You can't say why anywhere.	Ngeke usho ukuthi kungani noma kuphi.
I think we should go here.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kuzomele sihambe lapha.
He stayed at home for a week.	Wahlala isonto lonke ekhaya.
Her mother looked happy.	Umama wakhe wayebukeka ejabule.
Really good work.	Muhle umsebenzi ngempela.
No, food.	Cha, ukudla.
This was supposed to be great.	Lokhu kwakufanele kube okukhulu.
That is not a bad idea.	Akuwona umqondo omubi lowo.
I wanted to come home.	Ngangifuna ukuza ekhaya.
So, we do just that.	Ngakho, senza lokho kanye.
He had no reason to do so.	Wayengenaso isizathu sokwenza lokho.
How do you live alone.	Uhlala kanjani wedwa.
Taking too little for him.	Ukuthatha kancane kakhulu kuye.
You've been here a few times.	Ube lapha izikhathi ezimbalwa.
It is very much needed, very much.	Kudingeka kakhulu, kakhulu.
We must do the right thing.	Kufanele senze okufanele.
You look great, but you want to see it again.	Ubonakala engcono kakhulu, kodwa ufuna ukukubona futhi.
Now it is clear.	Manje kusobala .
Now it is not there.	Manje akukho lapho.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Sekuyisikhathi sokuthi wenze lokhu ngendlela efanele.
I know you are.	Ngiyazi uwena.
It all starts here.	Konke kuqala lapha.
But I, not you.	Kodwa mina, hhayi ngawe.
You know though.	Uyazi kodwa.
Finally, his life.	Ekugcineni, ukuphila kwakhe.
Finding life together.	Ukuthola ukuphila ndawonye.
He was able to do all this on his own.	Wakwazi ukwenza konke lokho eyedwa.
His flesh.	Inyama yakhe .
And that's just fine.	Futhi lokho kuhle nje.
He is there for me.	Ukhona kimi.
You want to be alone.	Ufuna uwedwa.
It can be easy to find.	Kungaba lula ukuthola.
She is afraid to go back to her house.	Wesaba ukubuyela endlini yakhe.
You know what you always say.	Uyazi ukuthi uthini njalo.
Not many, but enough.	Hhayi abaningi, kodwa ngokwanele.
So you have to go home.	Ngakho kufanele uye ekhaya.
That's great, so thank you for that.	Kuhle lokho, ngakho ngiyabonga ngalokho.

We'll have to do that.	Kuzofanele sikwenze lokho.
We want to go there.	Sifuna ukuya lapho.
I knew something about him.	Ngangazi okuthile ngaye.
This way you can hear everything.	Ngale ndlela uyakwazi ukuzwa konke.
He would just love to see you.	Angathanda nje ukukubona.
And we really have to go.	Futhi kufanele sihambe ngempela.
If you want to log in.	Uma ufuna ukungena.
I hope all is well in your world.	Ngethemba ukuthi konke kuhle emhlabeni wakho.
I mean not.	Ngisho ukuthi akunjalo.
He knew he would be back.	Wayazi ukuthi uzobuya.
We have to go to town.	Kuzofanele siye edolobheni.
Children as children, they say.	Izingane njengoba izingane, bathi.
Or he spoke.	Noma wakhuluma.
I don’t want to do too much about it.	Angifuni ukwenza okuningi ngakho.
I should have had my family.	Bekufanele ngibe nomndeni wami.
And you don't want to know.	Futhi awufuni ukwazi.
We need music.	Sidinga umculo.
Talk to him, and he will do it.	Ngikhulume naye, kulungile.
I had to get better.	Kwadingeka ngibe ngcono.
I should have stayed there.	Bekufanele ngihlale lapho.
And it is reflected in our work.	Futhi kubonakala emsebenzini wethu.
It is not always the right answer.	Akuyona njalo impendulo efanele.
Very, very soon.	Kakhulu, maduze nje.
I wanted to play more.	Bengifuna ukudlala kakhulu.
You are planning something very bad.	Uhlela into embi kakhulu.
But we all know that is not the case.	Kodwa sonke siyazi ukuthi akunjalo.
I already knew everyone in the class.	Ngangazi wonke umuntu ekilasini kakade.
This is simply not true.	Lokhu akulona iqiniso nje.
Really a long wait.	Impela ukulinda isikhathi eside.
But he thought he knew.	Kodwa wayecabanga ukuthi uyazi.
He should have known better than that.	Kwakufanele azi kangcono kunalokho.
But almost all of that.	Kodwa cishe konke lokho.
But you know that well.	Kodwa ukwazi kahle lokho.
He rarely goes out unless he goes with her.	Akavamile ukuphuma ngaphandle uma ehamba naye.
At least he never did.	Okungenani akakaze.
Just before we left.	Ngaphambi nje kokuba sihambe.
What, who knows.	Yini, ubani owaziyo.
At least he did his homework.	Okungenani wenza umsebenzi wakhe wesikole.
I have nothing more to say to you.	Akukho okunye okumele ngikutshele.
Not quite yet, at least.	Hhayi impela okwamanje, okungenani.
Not that he wouldn’t know anyway.	Hhayi ukuthi ubengeke azi noma kunjalo.
I hope you are happy.	Ngethemba ukuthi uyajabula.
I can never speak.	Angikwazi neze ukukhuluma.
He tried again.	Wazama futhi .
You can't walk now.	Awukwazi ukuhamba manje.
We want you to leave.	Sifuna uhambe.
And it still is.	Futhi kunjalo namanje.
He did it alone.	Wenza yedwa.
I wanted to try some.	Bengifuna ukuzama ezinye.
Well, that is not true at all.	Kulungile, lokho akulona iqiniso nhlobo.
She returned to him, happy.	Wabuyela kuye, ejabule.
You want to work hard.	Ufuna ukusebenza kanzima.
But that did not happen.	Kodwa lokho akuzange kube njalo.
I need to know why you are here.	Ngidinga ukwazi ukuthi kungani ulapha.
You will not have a choice.	Ngeke ube nakho ukukhetha.
I know, no matter what.	Ngiyazi, noma ngabe kwenzekani.
But someone had to.	Kodwa othile kwadingeka.
But if so, it should be so.	Kodwa uma kunjalo, kufanele kube njalo.
His exit will not be good.	Ukuphuma kwakhe ngeke kube kuhle.
You had to go.	Bekumele uhambe.
I would like an answer.	Ngingathanda ukuthola impendulo.
Work will do that for you.	Umsebenzi uzokwenza lokho kuwe.
But she is beautiful and does not mean anything.	Kodwa muhle akusho lutho.
It's hard, but it's true.	Kunzima, kodwa kuyiqiniso.
It should have been me.	Bekufanele kube yimina.
You need to get there first.	Kudingeka ufike lapho kuqala.
He got a big job.	Wathola umsebenzi omkhulu.
He lived for a few years.	Wahlala iminyaka embalwa.
Maybe you will do something about it.	Mhlawumbe uzokwenza okuthile ngaye.
I know exactly how it feels.	Ngiyazi kahle ukuthi kuzwakala kanjani.
He knows what to do.	Uyazi okufanele ukwenze.
I do a very good job.	Ngenza umsebenzi omuhle kakhulu.
But so is the case.	Kodwa kunjalo icala.
Nobody wants that to happen.	Akekho ofuna lokho kwenzeke.
Obviously not what happened.	Ngokusobala akukhona lokho okwenzekile.
But recently.	Kodwa muva nje.
Tom couldn't wait.	UTom akakwazanga ukulinda.
He made a noise.	Wakhipha umsindo.
There is nothing in the background.	Akukho lutho ngemuva.
Maybe he didn't have time.	Mhlawumbe wayengenaso isikhathi .
Pretend it happened to me.	Enza sengathi kwenzeka kimi.
We want to stay.	Sifuna ukuhlala.
She thinks of her mother.	Ucabanga umama wakhe.
I think it could be.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kungaba njalo.
He does not like to stay here.	Akathandi ukuhlala lapha.
She's scared, and that's okay.	Uyesaba, futhi lokho kulungile.
Still, you feel a little.	Noma kunjalo, uzizwa kancane.
You can't do that everywhere.	Ngeke ukwenze lokho yonke indawo.
Maybe you bought something.	Mhlawumbe uthenge okuthile.
He stayed home as much as possible.	Wahlala ekhaya ngangokunokwenzeka.
Outside, maybe, about you.	Ngaphandle, mhlawumbe, ngawe.
What you should always have.	Okufanele ube nakho ngaso sonke isikhathi.
I always like to stay as close as possible.	Ngihlale ngithanda ukuhlala eduze ngangokunokwenzeka.
So far nothing.	Kuze kube manje akukho lutho.
So much has happened here.	Kuningi kakhulu okwenzekile lapha.
Not really the case.	Akulona icala impela.
Everyone wanted to be with him.	Wonke umuntu wayefuna ukuba naye.
But only last year.	Kodwa ngonyaka odlule kuphela.
Not if.	Akunjalo uma.
He looked at his belongings.	Wabuka izinto zakhe.
Let me tell you.	Ake ngikutshele .
We can never know why that happened.	Asikwazi ukuthola ukuthi kungani lokho kwenzeka.
No night waiting.	Akukho ukulinda ebusuku.
Or you need help.	Noma udinga usizo.
I don't even have a gun.	Anginaso ngisho isibhamu.
Music speaks to me.	Umculo ukhuluma nami.
Until it is difficult again.	Kuze kube nzima futhi.
Outside, of course, for me.	Ngaphandle, kunjalo, kimi.
But, it did not.	Kodwa, akuzange.
I need someone here.	Ngidinga umuntu lapha.
He just didn't know.	Wayengazi nje.
Are you the same.	Ingabe ufana .
Everyone is lying on the floor.	Wonke umuntu ulele phansi.
I want to be a father.	Ngifuna ukuba ubaba.
You have to be.	Kufanele ube njalo.
But still the cat.	Kodwa namanje ikati.
I think this is your great gift.	Ngicabanga ukuthi lesi isipho sakho esiningi.
He knew we knew.	Wayazi ukuthi siyazi.
It will be you.	Uzoba nguwe.
But he saw that it was not possible.	Kodwa wabona ukuthi ngeke kwenzeke.
This is too long.	Isikhathi eside kakhulu lesi.
I like to drive something.	Ngithanda ukushayela into.
You're right, and you're trying hard.	Usho kahle, futhi uzama kanzima.
The only way to do it, though.	Indlela kuphela yokwenza, noma kunjalo.
But it really can be, it can be anyone.	Kodwa ngempela kungaba, kungaba noma ubani.
I'm not sure what happened in between.	Angiqiniseki kahle ukuthi kwenzekeni phakathi.
That's exactly why.	Yingakho ngempela.
I did the same at first.	Nami ngenza ekuqaleni.
I'm sure you won't.	Ngiyaqiniseka ukuthi ngeke.
He did that too.	Wakwenza lokho futhi.
That's good enough.	Lokho kuhle ngokwanele.
He knew he needed help.	Wayazi ukuthi udinga usizo.
Not your fault.	Akulona iphutha lakho.
Everyone wants an answer.	Wonke umuntu ufuna impendulo.
It could be huge.	Kungase kube enkulu.
You can walk.	Ungakwazi ukuhamba.
How can he be alone.	Angaba kanjani yedwa.
It happened a few times now.	Kwenzeke izikhathi ezimbalwa manje.
Just a word.	Izwi nje.
They said it was necessary but not necessary.	Bathi kwakudingeka kodwa akudingekile.
Some clothes.	Ezinye izingubo.
There is an error.	Kukhona iphutha.
I did it alone.	Ngikwenze ngedwa.
I feel like you do sometimes, as you sometimes know.	Ngizizwa sengathi wenza ngezinye izikhathi, njengoba ngezinye izikhathi uyazi.
We need to get better.	Kudingeka sibe ngcono.
Not too much there.	Akukho okuningi kakhulu lapho.
But that can be very hopeful.	Kodwa lokho kungase kube ithemba kakhulu.
He will not eat.	Ngeke adle.
It can be powerful.	Kungaba amandla.
My only problem.	Inkinga yami kuphela.
That, or stop now.	Lokho, noma yeka manje.
If you feel good, you look good !.	Uma uzizwa kahle, ubukeka kahle!.
I don't even know what she looks like.	Angazi nokuthi ubukeka kanjani.
Not just him.	Hhayi nje yena.
Probably a small place.	Mhlawumbe indawo encane.
Probably, in one place.	Mhlawumbe, endaweni eyodwa.
He got into the car.	Wangena emotweni.
Just like that.	Enjalo nje.
In prison.	Ejele.
He never had it, and he probably never will.	Akakaze abe nakho, futhi cishe akasoze.
It seems like yesterday to me.	Kubonakala sengathi izolo kimi.
He felt the danger.	Wezwa ingozi.
Food and everything, too.	Ukudla nakho konke, futhi.
You may have done so.	Kungenzeka ukuthi wenze njalo.
I didn't think I should, no.	Angizange ngicabange ukuthi kufanele, cha.
At least for me though.	Okungenani kimi noma kunjalo.
I should have done better for him.	Bekufanele ngenze kangcono ngaye.
The other is not.	Omunye akekho.
I sat next to him.	Ngihlale eduze kwakhe.
Not that it really should.	Hhayi ukuthi bekufanele ngempela.
Or eat yourself.	Noma udle wena.
Three times in thirty years.	Izikhathi ezintathu eminyakeni engamashumi amathathu.
You me.	Wena, nami.
He should speak.	Kufanele akhulume.
This is a bad place.	Lena indawo embi.
Too many to hear.	Abaningi kakhulu ukuzwa.
Or his girlfriend.	Noma intombi yakhe.
We need to do something, though.	Kudingeka senze okuthile, noma kunjalo.
Now he is just sitting in school.	Manje uhlezi nje esikoleni.
My mother looks happy.	Umama ubukeka ejabule.
The police saw it all.	Amaphoyisa abone konke.
Just a problem.	Inkinga nje .
You can't just say that.	Ngeke nje usho lokho.
Probably his teacher.	Mhlawumbe uthisha wakhe.
Now we have to get the books.	Manje kufanele sithole izincwadi.
He was afraid he would never.	Wayesaba ukuthi akasoze.
I'm sure he'll be back later.	Ngiqinisekile ukuthi uzobuya kamuva.
He just speaks like that.	Ukhuluma kanjalo nje.
Still, finding almost nothing means nothing.	Noma kunjalo, ukuthola cishe lutho akusho lutho.
He would not go to such a place.	Wayengeke aye endaweni enjalo.
He just does, that's all.	Wenza nje, yilokho kuphela.
Another came to him.	Omunye weza kuye.
You'd better go alone.	Kungcono uhambe kahle wedwa.
I want nothing to do with this.	Angifuni lutho ngalokhu.
You should know this beforehand.	Kufanele ukwazi lokhu ngaphambili.
It is said that you know a lot.	Kuthiwa wazi okuningi.
The best way to do that is to simplify it.	Indlela engcono kakhulu yokwenza lokho ukwenza lula.
I will not stay.	Ngeke ngihlale.
This makes it easier.	Lokhu ukwenza lula.
He too seemed surprised.	Naye wabonakala emangele.
Since then, he is gone.	Kusukela lapho, akekho.
The only problem is that it is not true.	Inkinga nje ukuthi akulona iqiniso.
But that is not what he is.	Kodwa akukhona lokho ayikho.
I didn't see anything else at first.	Angizange ngibone enye into ekuqaleni.
But he knows all that.	Kodwa uyakwazi konke lokho.
He did it all.	Ukwenze konke.
How long will it take ?.	Kuzothatha isikhathi esingakanani?.
That person.	Lowo muntu.
It should be so here.	Kufanele kube njalo lapha.
You know, but it's my job.	Uyazi, kodwa umsebenzi wami.
My only son.	Indodana yami eyodwa.
You really should.	Empeleni kufanele.
We have built a good team.	Sakhe iqembu elihle.
When he spoke, he was thinking of other things.	Lapho ekhuluma, wayecabanga ngezinye izinto.
Only then should he be all or nothing.	Kuphela lapho kufanele abe konke noma lutho.
I need to talk to him, too.	Ngidinga ukukhuluma naye, futhi.
Not really, though.	Akunjalo ngempela, noma kunjalo.
So he stays.	Ngakho uhlala.
Things without me.	Izinto ngaphandle kwami.
At least that's what happened to me.	Okungenani yilokho okwenzekayo kimi.
He knew a lot.	Wayazi okuningi.
I will do it later.	Ngizokwenza kamuva.
What a horrible thing to do.	Yeka into embi ukuyenza.
Now it only happens once a year, if that.	Manje kwenzeka kanye kuphela ngonyaka, uma lokho.
And, of course, there is power.	Futhi, kunjalo, kukhona amandla.
You can ride at one time.	Ungakwazi ukugibela ngesikhathi esisodwa.
For a long time, in this case.	Isikhathi eside, kulokhu.
There must be something.	Kukhona okumele kube khona.
I suspect it is possible.	Ngisola ukuthi kungenzeka.
It has also.	Kuye futhi.
He was just scared.	Wavele wesaba.
And in fact there is no problem.	Futhi empeleni ayikho inkinga.
This is not a good way.	Lena akuyona indlela enhle.
We cannot do it alone.	Ngeke sikwenze sodwa.
Maybe, but maybe not.	Mhlawumbe, kodwa mhlawumbe akunjalo.
It should have been really good.	Bekufanele kube kuhle ngempela.
All together now.	Konke ndawonye manje.
Stop making it difficult for both of us.	Yeka ukwenza kube nzima kithi sobabili.
Probably never.	Cishe akasoze.
I said, yes, that's right.	Ngathi, yebo, kunjalo.
I should be very happy.	Kufanele ngijabule kakhulu.
You just need a chance.	Udinga nje ithuba.
But, it never happened.	Kodwa, akuzange kwenzeke.
He should not have done that.	Bekungafanele akwenze lokho.
You are the only one to me.	Uwena wedwa kimi.
But nobody wants anyone to learn something.	Kodwa akekho ofuna ukuthi umuntu afunde okuthile.
I want you to go with him.	Ngifuna uhambe naye.
More about us here.	Okuningi ngathi lapha.
I’m happy with the way it happened, really.	Ngijabule ngendlela okwenzeka ngayo, ngempela.
That’s it, but also a lot more.	Yilokho, kodwa futhi kuningi kakhulu.
It will be difficult at first.	Kuzoba nzima ekuqaleni.
He wants nothing.	Akafuni lutho.
He'll just do it.	Uzokwenza nje.
I do not remember.	Angisakhumbuli yini.
You know what you look like and how you act.	Uyazi ukuthi ubukeka kanjani nokuthi wenza kanjani.
We had to go all the time.	Kwakufanele sihambe sonke isikhathi.
It must be a lie.	Kumelwe kube amanga.
He knows where he lives.	Uyazi lapho ehlala khona.
It will be tomorrow.	Kuzoba kusasa.
No, we do not know that.	Cha, asikwazi lokho.
Not today, but soon.	Hhayi namuhla, kodwa maduze.
I would love to take a job.	Ngingathanda kakhulu ukuthatha umsebenzi.
He was not a man then.	Wayengeyena muntu ngaleso sikhathi.
So there is another way.	Ngakho kukhona enye indlela.
So there is really much to do.	Ngakho kuningi ngempela okufanele sikwenze.
I wish you were here to see this.	Ngifisa sengathi ngabe ulapha ukuze abone lokhu.
So it had to be.	Ngakho kwakufanele kube njalo.
If you want to talk, you can.	Uma ufuna ukukhuluma, ungakwazi.
In fact, it is too early.	Empeleni kusenesikhathi.
We need a little more.	Sidinga okwengeziwe kancane.
He looked outside.	Wabuka ngaphandle.
He said there was nothing wrong.	Uthe akukho okubi.
You try to do everything at once.	Uzama ukwenza konke ngesikhathi esisodwa.
And everyone looked up at him.	Futhi wonke umuntu wabheka phezulu kuye.
My mother seemed happy.	Umama wabonakala ejabule.
Absolutely.	Impela impela.
I have never seen anything.	Angikaze ngibone lutho.
Every morning, at least.	Njalo ekuseni, okungenani.
Hopefully, it has been helpful.	Ngethemba, kube usizo.
I wanted to do it right.	Bengifuna ukukwenza kahle.
He just has to do it.	Kumele akwenze nje.
Everyone sat down again.	Wonke umuntu wahlala phansi futhi.
But you also want to know the truth.	Kodwa futhi ufuna ukwazi iqiniso.
I never said such a thing.	Angizange ngisho into enjalo.
This is what you will have to do.	Lokhu kuzofanele ukwenze.
What do you think it looks like to him.	Ucabanga ukuthi kubukeka kanjani kuye.
It is not necessary yet but you can.	Akudingekile noma kunjalo kodwa ungakwazi.
But your presence will be very helpful.	Kodwa ukuba khona kwakho kuzoba usizo impela.
It is time for this to happen.	Sekuyisikhathi sokuthi kwenzeke lokhu.
All in a few years.	Konke eminyakeni embalwa.
We are not here.	Asikho lapha.
You will be beautiful.	Uzoba muhle.
First, you do not need to know this.	Okokuqala, akudingekile ukwazi lokhu.
It happened yesterday.	Kwenzeke izolo.
I never had that.	Angizange ngibe nakho lokho.
But he doesn't want to hear from you.	Kodwa akafuni ukuzwa kuwe.
He hurried into her.	Wangena ngokushesha kuye.
Nothing to say.	Akukho ukusho.
No, he could not.	Cha, akakwazanga.
Yes, yes, indeed.	Yebo, yebo, impela.
No, he never came here.	Cha, akakaze eze lapha.
And you know you can.	Futhi uyazi ukuthi uyakwazi.

He actually wanted to get out.	Empeleni wayefuna ukuphuma.
Thank you, too.	Ngiyabonga, futhi.
But sometimes it is okay to go.	Kodwa ngezinye izikhathi kulungile ukuhamba.
I can't figure out why.	Angikwazi ukuthola ukuthi kungani kunjalo.
Everything can be easy.	Konke kungaba lula.
My mother does not want to know anything.	Umama akafuni ukwazi lutho.
For a few years everything is fine.	Iminyaka embalwa konke kuhle.
Probably not a problem.	Mhlawumbe ayikho inkinga.
Not at first, but yes.	Hhayi ekuqaleni, kodwa yebo.
No he was not.	Cha wayengekho.
I don't think you should be around me.	Angicabangi ukuthi kufanele ube eduze kwami.
His spirit improved as he walked.	Umoya wakhe waba ngcono njengoba ehamba.
Don't be pretty.	Ungabi muhle.
Anyway that's my thinking so far.	Noma kunjalo lokho ukucabanga kwami ​​​​kuze kube manje.

And thank you, for everything.	Futhi ngiyabonga, ngakho konke.
Hope to see you where you are !.	Ngethemba ukukubona lapho ukhona!.
Sometimes, it is very necessary.	Ngezinye izikhathi, kudingeka kakhulu.
Or at least it should have been.	Noma okungenani bekufanele kube njalo.
Not that he agreed.	Hhayi ukuthi wavuma.
This was to be very difficult for him.	Lokhu kwakufanele kube nzima kakhulu kuye.
I never thought it would be so good.	Angikaze ngicabange ukuthi kungaba kuhle kanje.
I asked my father.	Ngabuza ubaba.
But you never knew anyone well.	Kodwa awuzange wazi muntu kahle.
He knew he had to do something about it.	Wayazi ukuthi kwakudingeka enze okuthile ngakho.
A little better for him.	Kahle kancane kuye.
He used to sleep in the car.	Wayevame ukulala emotweni.
You want to find out why.	Ufuna ukuthola ukuthi kungani.
If you can, that's right.	Uma ukwazi, kunjalo.
That is not a good reason.	Akusona isizathu esihle leso.
I always wanted to do something else.	Ngihlale ngifuna ukwenza okunye.
He was completely invisible.	Wayengabonakali nhlobo.
He can control himself.	Angakwazi ukuzibamba.
I heard about it all.	Ngezwa ngakho konke.
That will not be me.	Lokho ngeke kube yimina.
I do a good job.	Ngenza umsebenzi omuhle.
I feel bad, and so do you.	Ngizwa ubuhlungu, ngakho nawe uzizwa kanjalo.
If you would like.	Uma ungathanda.
Yes, you will be making mistakes.	Yebo, uzobe wenza amaphutha.
At least I'm convinced.	Okungenani ngiyaqiniseka.
Or work, really.	Noma umsebenzi, ngempela.
When you really can't do that.	Lapho empeleni awukwazi ukwenza lokho.
You did your thing.	Wenze into yakho.
Obviously not my fault.	Ngokusobala akulona iphutha lami.
Definitely a choice.	Impela ukukhetha.
He did not make a door.	Akazange enze umnyango.
Any other life will not be me.	Noma iyiphi enye impilo ngeke kube yimi.
Not anything or nothing.	Hhayi lutho noma lutho.
You should get to that quickly.	Kufanele ufike kulokho ngokushesha.
Time is our problem.	Isikhathi inkinga yethu.
Sounds like it now.	Kuzwakala sengathi manje.
At the door.	Emnyango.
It will be the same for everything.	Kuzoba njalo ngakho konke.
It's hard to do.	Kunzima ukukwenza.
I really want to read.	Ngifuna kakhulu ukufunda.
You need to do it anyway.	Udinga ukukwenza noma kunjalo.
And it is not a bad health.	Futhi akuyona impilo embi.
I heard his voice.	Ngezwa izwi lakhe.
I know it's time for you to go.	Ngiyazi sekuyisikhathi sokuthi uhambe.
Something you need to do more.	Okuthile okudingeka ukwenze okwengeziwe.
I have to do something to help my dad.	Kuzomele ngenze okuthile ukusiza ubaba.

And it sounds better.	Futhi kuzwakala kungcono.
And maybe my son.	Futhi mhlawumbe indodana yami.
He did not say how difficult it would be for me.	Akazange asho ukuthi kuzoba nzima kangakanani kimi.
That is exactly what he did.	Yilokho kanye akwenza.
Maybe he can too.	Mhlawumbe naye angaba njalo.
Maybe it would be better to wait a while.	Mhlawumbe kungaba ngcono ukulinda isikhashana.
It will not be redone.	Ngeke kube kabusha.
Good reason.	Isizathu esihle.
But he tried.	Kodwa wazama.
But there is a need for us.	Kodwa kukhona isidingo ngathi.
But soon he will come.	Kodwa maduze uzofika.
He felt the air in the room.	Wezwa umoya ekamelweni.
When and when.	Uma futhi nini.
Well done, thank you.	Ufike kahle, ngiyabonga.
So he decided.	Ngakho wanquma.
That is what happened at that time.	Yilokho okwenzeka ngaleso sikhathi.
I know what you want to talk about.	Ngiyazi ukuthi ufuna ukukhuluma ngani.
Or maybe it's me.	Noma mhlawumbe yimina.
I wanted to make a big impression.	Ngangifuna ukwenza umbono omkhulu.
That’s why we want to go faster.	Yingakho sifuna ukuhamba ngokushesha.
Everyone seems to know something.	Wonke umuntu ubonakala azi okuthile.
It's just not a good idea.	Akuwona nje umqondo omuhle.
Neither should it.	Akufanele futhi ube njalo.
As you say, you're just a kid.	Njengoba usho, uyingane nje.
The question here is exactly when.	Umbuzo lapha uthi ngempela nini.
Me and him out.	Mina naye nje.
But you are the only one at home.	Kodwa uwena wedwa ekhaya.
Certainly I can.	Impela ngingakwazi.
I want us to be together.	Ngifuna sibe ndawonye.
I made my choice.	Ngenza ukukhetha kwami.
He told me about it.	Wangitshela ngakho.
He did not want help.	Wayengafuni usizo.
That could be just today.	Lokho kungaba namuhla nje.
He is everywhere.	Ukhona yonke indawo.
He didn't want to do homework.	Wayengafuni ukwenza umsebenzi wesikole.
Please do a good job.	Ngicela wenze umsebenzi omuhle.
But not so with us.	Kodwa akunjalo kithi.
But my mother does not want to.	Kodwa umama akafuni.
I want you to stay here, have fun here.	Ngifuna uhlale lapha, ujabule lapha.
He would never be there again.	Wayengeke aphinde abe khona.
Please stay with me.	Ngicela uhlale nami.
It is definitely not the right thing to do.	Akuyona neze into efanele ukuyenza.
But still he said yes.	Kodwa noma kunjalo uthe yebo.
I know how hard it is at first.	Ngiyazi ukuthi kunzima kangakanani ekuqaleni.
I just need to sit down for a bit.	Ngidinga nje ukuhlala phansi kancane.
He did not want anyone to know he was here.	Wayengafuni ukuthi omunye umuntu azi ukuthi ulapha.
Now you know how it happened.	Manje uyazi ukuthi kwenzeka kanjani.
Not exactly three.	Hhayi impela amathathu.
But this time.	Kodwa kulokhu .
One way to do this is to do it.	Enye indlela yokwenza lokhu.
I want you to be with me.	Ngifuna ube nami.
He knew everything about me.	Wayazi yonke into ngami.
But that doesn't mean you're not a great person.	Kodwa lokho akusho ukuthi awuyena umuntu omkhulu.
So, no problem.	Ngakho, akukho nkinga.
In this case it happened.	Kulokhu kwenzeka.
Unless he talks to me.	Ngaphandle uma ekhuluma nami.
You can only like a boy.	Ungathanda umfana kuphela.
You need.	Udinga .
Really work.	Impela umsebenzi.
Here the view is much better.	Lapha umbono ungcono kakhulu.
I went wrong.	Ngihambe kabi.
I was thinking a word now.	Bengicabanga izwi manje.
This happened very quickly.	Lokhu kwenzeke ngokushesha okukhulu.
I'm not sure what that looks like right now.	Angiqiniseki ukuthi lokho kubukeka kanjani okwamanje.
My mother does it every year.	Umama wenza njalo ngonyaka.
Play is good.	Ukudlala kuhle.
Because there is really no problem here.	Ngoba ayikho ngempela inkinga lapha.
Not really, as it happened.	Akunjalo ngempela, njengoba kwenzeka.
I will never have him at home again.	Angeke ngiphinde ngibe naye ekhaya.
Last year he really did.	Ngonyaka odlule wenza ngempela.
These are just children.	Izingane nje lezi.
This is not a family.	Akuwona umndeni lo.
It's almost like he's going somewhere.	Cishe sengathi kukhona lapho eya khona.
Sounds true because it is.	Kuzwakala kuyiqiniso ngoba kunjalo.
That is true to this day.	Lokho kuyiqiniso kuze kube namuhla.
First of all, nothing happens on your own.	Okokuqala, akukho okwenzekayo uwedwa.
But he tried anyway.	Kodwa wazama noma kunjalo.
He had no need.	Wayengenaso isidingo.
I have to say this.	Kumele ngisho lokhu.
There is another car in the area.	Kukhona enye imoto endaweni.
You seem to know a lot about this.	Ubonakala wazi okuningi ngalokhu.
Apparently he did.	Kubonakala sengathi wakwenza.
Yes, it can.	Yebo, kungaba.
I couldn't but.	Angikwazanga kodwa.
Not at all, I say.	Hhayi lutho, ngisho.
That never happened to me.	Lokho akuzange kwenzeke kimi.
She was scared and wanted to leave.	Wayesaba futhi efuna ukuhamba.
I apologize for everything that happened.	Ngiyaxolisa ngakho konke okwenzekile.
And it happened very quickly.	Futhi kwenzeka ngokushesha okukhulu.
But you are probably wrong.	Kodwa mhlawumbe unephutha.
He felt the same way about her.	Wazizwa ngendlela efanayo ngaye.
All around the world .	Emhlabeni wonke .
And he did not eat the bread.	Futhi akazange adle isidlo.
You do not have to do everything yourself.	Awudingi ukwenza yonke into uwedwa.
He is not at all.	Akekho nhlobo .
Many, many also.	Abaningi, abaningi futhi.
He did it.	Akwenzile .
You should have slept.	Bekufanele ngabe ulele.
You have to do it slowly.	Kufanele ukwenze kancane.
The key is here.	Ukhiye ulapha.
And you should not do it.	Futhi akufanele ukwenze.
There is nobody here.	Akukho muntu nhlobo lapha.
He looked very young.	Wayebukeka esemncane nje.
But in the meantime you should consider.	Kodwa okwamanje kufanele ucabange.
He was not sure how he felt about her.	Wayengenaso isiqiniseko sokuthi uzizwa kanjani ngaye.
New every year.	Entsha njalo ngonyaka.
But it will not be necessary.	Kodwa ngeke kudingeke.
He talked to me about this.	Wakhuluma nami ngalokhu.
I have been thinking and thinking about it.	Bengilokhu ngicabanga futhi ngicabanga ngakho.
Sometimes, not so much.	Ngezinye izikhathi, hhayi kakhulu.
That will be really hard to find.	Lokho kuzoba nzima ngempela ukuthola.
I always thought of him.	Ngihlale ngicabanga ngaye.
I want to see a plan.	Ngifuna ukubona icebo.
Or at least something like that.	Noma okungenani into enjalo.
Just always.	Njalo nje.
He did not want to know everything about her.	Wayengafuni ukwazi konke ngaye.
He wants his father.	Ufuna ubaba wakhe.
How should you know? 	Kufanele ngabe uyazi kanjani?
They were shocked.	Wazizwa.
His entry.	Ukungena kwakhe.
I wish none of us knew that.	Ngifisa sengathi akekho kithi owaziyo lokho.
I want it to be so.	Ngifuna kube njalo.
So, it happened so quickly.	Ngakho, kwenzeka kanjalo ngokushesha.
But nothing, nothing.	Kodwa akukho lutho, akekho.
And who knows what else.	Futhi ubani owaziyo ukuthi yini enye.
He works all day.	Usebenza usuku lonke.
It does not say when.	Akusho ukuthi nini.
You try things.	Uzama izinto.
You need something more.	Udinga okuthile okwengeziwe.
Not too much.	Hhayi lutho kakhulu.
She is very beautiful too.	Muhle kakhulu futhi.
And very good.	Futhi omuhle kakhulu.
He may know someone.	Angase azi othile.
He does not know how much.	Akazi ukuthi malini.
I want to see you go.	Ngifuna ukukubona uhamba.
That’s why we do this, right ?.	Yingakho senza lokhu, akunjalo?.
Maybe next summer.	Mhlawumbe ehlobo elizayo.
I know a little bit what you mean.	Ngiyazi kancane ukuthi usho ukuthini.
That much of you are true.	Lokho okuningi kwakho kuyiqiniso.
I need one more.	Ngidinga enye futhi.
I think that for the first time.	Ngicabanga ukuthi okokuqala.
He didn't want to, at first.	Wayengafuni, ekuqaleni.
He did so.	Wenza kanjalo .
Not immediately, there.	Hhayi ngokushesha, lapho.
This is true or false.	Lokhu kuyiqiniso noma amanga.
He did not want to talk about it.	Akazange afune ukukhuluma ngakho.
And now it is not.	Futhi manje ayikho.
Good to know.	Kuhle ukwazi.
You can't, because of you.	Angeke, ngenxa yakho.
Now we know how good it is.	Manje siyazi ukuthi kuhle kangakanani.
A new job may be needed.	Kungase kudingeke umsebenzi omusha.
At least for now, he can't.	Okungenani okwamanje, akakwazi.
Someone had to do something.	Othile bekufanele enze okuthile.
He tried one of you.	Wazama okunye kwakho.
And it never happened.	Futhi akuzange kwenzeke.
But let me tell you why.	Kodwa ake ngikutshele ukuthi kungani.
But how do you know when that happens ?.	Kodwa wazi kanjani nje uma lokho kwenzeka?.
And no one else, either.	Futhi akekho omunye, ngeke.
Why this.	Kungani le nto.
Doing a good job.	Ukwenza umsebenzi omuhle.
He walks at night.	Uhamba ebusuku.
This happens every day here.	Lokhu kwenzeka nsuku zonke lapha.
Everything seems fine for a while.	Konke kubonakala kulungile isikhashana.
My mother never talked about it.	Umama akakaze akhulume ngayo.
My three years.	Iminyaka yami emithathu.
I need this for work.	Ngidinga lokhu ngomsebenzi.
I saw how possible.	Ngabona ukuthi kungenzeka kanjani.
Stop working on everything else.	Yeka ukusebenza kukho konke okunye.
He would not just want to eat anything.	Wayengeke nje afune ukudla noma yini.
It's hard, it really is.	Kunzima, kunjalo ngempela.
I will not say anything now.	Ngeke ngisho lutho manje.
She doesn't want to be beautiful.	Akafuni ukuba muhle.
She loves time alone.	Uthanda isikhathi eyedwa.
It will not be so good.	Ngeke kube kuhle kangako.
There is only one or the other.	Kukhona eyodwa kuphela noma enye.
That is nothing new.	Lokho akuyona into entsha.
I mean, she's beautiful.	Ngisho, muhle.
But in the end, that is what happened anyway.	Kodwa ekugcineni, yilokho okwenzeka noma kunjalo.
He only got flowers once.	Wathola izimbali kanye kuphela.
There is a great danger here.	Kukhona ingozi enkulu lapha.
And this too.	Futhi lokhu futhi.
Not good, but it's better.	Hhayi kahle, kodwa kungcono.
Too many photos.	Izithombe eziningi kakhulu.
Still, he had to know.	Noma kunjalo, kwakufanele azi.
He thought that he, too, should be.	Wayecabanga ukuthi naye, kwakufanele abe njalo.
Guitar for life.	Isiginci impilo yonke.
I would like to die.	Ngingathanda ukufa.
You can't say no.	Awukwazi ukuthi cha.
He was not in town at the time.	Wayengekho edolobheni ngaleso sikhathi.
In the morning, he was thinking.	Ekuseni, wayecabanga.
And he took something from me.	Futhi wathatha okuthile kimi.
So far all the work.	Kuze kube manje wonke umsebenzi.
How do you feel about that ?.	Uzizwa kanjani ngalokho?.
Why do you go there, why does everyone go there.	Kungani uya lapho, kungani wonke umuntu eya lapho.

I was thinking about that at least.	Bengicabanga ngalokho okungenani.
Everyone at school will know.	Wonke umuntu esikoleni uzokwazi.
Thank you, thank you for everything.	Ngiyabonga, ngiyabonga ngakho konke.
He is your best man.	Uyindoda yakho engcono kakhulu.
But yes, that would be my questions.	Kodwa yebo, lokho kungaba imibuzo yami.
I had to say something.	Bekumele ngikhulume okuthile.
I need to hear the truth.	Ngidinga ukuzwa iqiniso.
Good news.	Indaba enhle.
That is not my story.	Akuyona indaba yami leyo.
But in reality, it is very good.	Kodwa empeleni, kuhle kakhulu.
He had to think about it.	Kwadingeka acabange ngakho.
There is so much more anyway.	Kukhona okuningi okuningi noma kunjalo.
Please consider this.	Ngicela ucabange lokhu.
You do what you think is best.	Wenza lokho ocabanga ukuthi kungcono kakhulu.
Yes, it should have been so from the beginning.	Yebo, bekufanele kube njalo kusukela ekuqaleni.
Everything you can do.	Konke ungakwenza.
Glad to hear.	Ngiyajabula ukuzwa.
Well he told me to have that.	Kahle wangitshela ukuthi ngibe nalokho.
You do not need your money.	Awudingi imali yakho.
I'm not sure exactly.	Angiqiniseki ngendlela efanele.
Or so.	Noma asho kanjalo.
So, you are not a person to me.	Ngalokho, awuyena umuntu kimi.
I should not be happy.	Akufanele ngijabule.
You will not do well.	Ngeke ukwenze kahle.
He is always absent.	Uhlale engekho.
You will have to go with us.	Kuzodingeka uhambe nathi.
In the office all day.	Ehhovisi usuku lonke.
I want your team in this.	Ngifuna iqembu lakho kulokhu.
It was clear he meant nothing.	Kwacaca ukuthi akusho lutho.
But it probably never happened.	Kodwa cishe akuzange kwenzeke.
And everyone has a good time.	Futhi wonke umuntu unesikhathi esihle.
He wanted to live that long.	Wayefuna ukuphila isikhathi eside kangako.
Speaking is not necessary.	Ukukhuluma akudingekile.
You have done this before.	Uke wenza ngale ndlela ngaphambilini.
Or we just do.	Noma senza nje.
He has really hurt you.	Wenze kabi ngempela ngawe.
Getting out can be a problem.	Ukuphuma kungaba inkinga.
What to say.	Okumele ukusho.
He looked completely out.	Wabheka ngaphandle ngokuphelele.
Or it seems, from the outside.	Noma kubonakala sengathi, kusukela ngaphandle.
He promised to leave.	Wathembisa ukuthi uzohamba.
I want to continue with that.	Ngifuna ukuqhubeka nalokho.
You work your whole life to get here.	Usebenza impilo yakho yonke ukuze ufike lapha.
I would like to read that book.	Ngingathanda ukufunda leyo ncwadi.
He slowly entered the room.	Wangena kancane ekamelweni.
You did this.	Nguwe owenze lokhu.
It's all his fault.	Iphutha lakhe lonke.
He wants to be with you.	Ufuna ukuba nawe.
Does anyone want to try that ?.	Ukhona ofuna ukuzama lokho?.
But for now.	Kodwa okwamanje .
For all of us.	Ngenxa yethu sonke.
Good on you for that.	Kuhle kuwe ngalokho.
Being here and now.	Ukuba lapha futhi manje.
And he knew there was no answer to that.	Futhi wayazi ukuthi ayikho impendulo kulokho.
When there is no one else.	Lapho akekho omunye.
And it was not necessary for him.	Futhi kwakungadingeki kuye.
You'll be fine with it.	Uzoba muhle kukho.
Really hopeful.	Ithemba impela.
Well, to be beautiful.	Kuhle, ukuba muhle.
It happens almost every morning.	Kwenzeka cishe njalo ekuseni.
He was always surprised.	Wamangala njalo.
I never told anyone that.	Angikaze ngitshele muntu lokho.
Yes, he knew nothing.	Yebo, wayengazi lutho.
But I do not know how.	Kodwa angikwazi ukuthi kanjani.
He knew the boy had to eat.	Wayazi ukuthi umfana kufanele adle.
There is just so much to do.	Kuningi nje okumele kwenziwe.
No one else should know.	Akekho omunye okufanele azi.
He immediately left, and immediately.	Ngokushesha wahamba, futhi ngokushesha.
So far, this has had to happen.	Kuze kube manje, lokhu kwadingeka kwenziwe okuthile.
But this is not the way.	Kodwa lena akuyona indlela.
I do not understand you or him.	Angiqondi wena noma yena.
So here ?.	Ngakho lapha?.
Very much and obviously.	Kakhulu futhi ngokusobala.
How did it happen.	Kwenzeke kanjani.
Home later, if so.	Ekhaya kamuva, uma kunjalo.
He lives there.	Uhlala khona.
Maybe a slow walk.	Mhlawumbe ukuhamba kancane.
He turned on the music.	Wavula umculo.
This should be the case, because this is very obvious.	Lokhu kufanele kube njalo, ngoba lokhu kubonakala kakhulu.
But either way is good for me.	Kodwa noma iyiphi indlela kuhle kimi.
But this is not a good time.	Kodwa lesi akusona isikhathi esihle.
There should be time.	Kufanele kube nesikhathi.
That is very clear.	Lokho kusobala impela.
Death too.	Ukufa nakho.
Nothing happened.	Akuzange kwenzeke lutho.
Someone made a mistake.	Kukhona owenze iphutha.
It is by no means a mistake.	Akuwona neze amaphutha.
Yes you too.	Yebo nawe.
Music too.	Umculo futhi.
She is sitting there.	Uhlezi lapho.
But just seeing.	Kodwa ukubona nje.
I can't imagine life without him now.	Angikwazi ukucabanga ukuphila ngaphandle kwakhe manje.
But all that happened later.	Kodwa konke lokho kwenzeka ngemva.
He is, of course.	Naye, kunjalo.
Everyone needs help.	Wonke umuntu ufuna usizo.
Maybe that's all.	Mhlawumbe lokho kuphela.
That is not a mistake.	Akulona iphutha lelo.
You've done a good job with it, too.	Wenze umsebenzi omuhle ngakho, futhi.
I talked about it.	Ngikhulume ngakho.
I would not, I would not, do it.	Bengingeke, bengingeke, ngikwenze.
He likes to be busy all the time.	Uthanda ukuba matasa ngaso sonke isikhathi.
In fact, my mother did just that.	Empeleni, umama wakwenza lokho.
It's been a few months.	Sekuphele izinyanga ezimbalwa.
But please think about it.	Kodwa ngicela ucabange ngakho.
Maybe he doesn't think so.	Mhlawumbe akacabangi kanjalo.
So that's all this.	Ngakho yilokho konke lokhu.
That's the continuation.	Yilokho ukuqhubeka.
I need more exit.	Ngidinga ukuphuma okwengeziwe.
I hope you do not need to do that again.	Ngethemba ukuthi awudingi ukwenza lokho futhi.
For the good of him.	Ukuze kube kuhle kuye.
We did our best though.	Sikwenze konke okusemandleni kodwa.
I want to live, that's all.	Ngifuna ukuphila, yilokho kuphela.
Take him to prison.	Ahambe naye ejele.
And let me always want more.	Futhi ake ngihlale ngifuna okwengeziwe.
You may have done what you did last night.	Kungenzeka ukuthi wenzeni izolo ebusuku.
He looked into his eyes.	Wabheka amehlo.
You know what happened instead.	Uyazi ukuthi kwenzekeni esikhundleni.
He never said much.	Akakaze akhulume okuningi.
I mean everyone.	Ngisho wonke umuntu.
I just don’t think about it.	Angicabangi nje ngakho.
I want you to do this.	Ngifuna wenze lokhu.
Or even some of you.	Noma ngisho okunye kwakho.
So you can do all that.	Ngakho ungakwenza konke lokho.
Everyone should stay together.	Wonke umuntu kufanele ahlale ndawonye.
You need coffee.	Udinga ikhofi.
Very, very happy about that.	Kakhulu, ngijabule kakhulu ngalokho.
Or maybe all of them.	Noma mhlawumbe wonke.
But it is not a good idea either.	Kodwa akuwona umqondo omuhle futhi.
What happened, but not always.	Okwenzekile, kodwa hhayi njalo.
Speaking is true.	Ukukhuluma kuyiqiniso.
Your marriage will be better.	Umshado wakho uzoba ngcono.
Or just arrived.	Noma efika nje.
I thought it was my fault.	Bengicabanga ukuthi iphutha lami.
No, but he could too.	Akunjalo, kodwa angase futhi.
And this is not the case here.	Futhi lokhu akunjalo lapha.
All stay well so far.	Konke ukuhlala kube kuhle kuze kube manje.
I just didn’t know about him.	Bengingazi nje ngaye.
I wanted to think but not too much.	Bengifuna ukucabanga kodwa hhayi kakhulu.
Maybe that happened to me.	Mhlawumbe lokho kwenzeka kimi.
I do not want to be without you.	Angifuni ukuba ngaphandle kwakho.
He did so alone.	Wakwenza lokho eyedwa.
I haven't heard from him yet.	Angizange ngizwe kuye okwamanje.
A few months nothing.	Izinyanga ezimbalwa lutho.
That's what happens when you say it as it is.	Yilokho okwenzekayo uma usho njengoba kunjalo.
He did not try to make friends.	Akazange azame ukwenza abangane.
He's just a really big kid.	Uyingane enkulu nje impela.
Or you say the right thing and it will happen.	Noma usho into efanele futhi kuzoba khona.
Not without you.	Hhayi ngaphandle kwakho.
I wonder how long that will take.	Kazi kuzothatha isikhathi esingakanani lokho.
This should be done in one place at a time.	Lokhu kufanele kwenziwe endaweni eyodwa ngesikhathi.
I think it looks better this way.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kubukeka kungcono ngale ndlela.
I don’t know how you feel about him.	Angazi ukuthi uzizwa kanjani ngaye.
I just know it is.	Ngiyazi nje ukuthi kunjalo.
Great first.	Okukhulu kuqala.
Let me stay.	Ake ngihlale.
But he could not stop.	Kodwa akakwazanga ukuyeka.
Almost everything.	Cishe yonke into.
You should have done well.	Kufanele ngabe wenze kahle.
You learn from it.	Ufunda kukho.
Almost entirely so.	Cishe kanjalo ngokuphelele.
Everyone was very helpful.	Wonke umuntu waba usizo kakhulu.
Really, really down.	Ngempela, phansi ngempela.
Mom did a little, at first.	Umama wenza kancane, ekuqaleni.
I think this is good.	Ngicabanga ukuthi lokhu kuhle.
He saw the city.	Wabona umuzi.
I did not do well.	Angizange ngenze kahle.
I want to see it all.	Ngifuna ukukubona konke.
He wanted to do it again.	Wayefuna aphinde.
And maybe because.	Futhi mhlawumbe ngoba.
It all happened so fast.	Konke kwenzeka ngokushesha.
Yeah, that's it, exactly.	Yebo, yilokho, impela.
Not for anyone else.	Akufanele futhi omunye umuntu.
I can't have it, you know.	Angikwazi ukuba nakho, uyazi.
He also felt good.	Naye wezwa kahle.
I never thought it would be so difficult.	Angikaze ngicabange ukuthi kuzoba nzima kangako.
Not bad money.	Akuyona imali embi.
Probably a bit.	Kungenzeka kancane.
You always feel bad like this.	Uhlale uzizwa kabi kanje.
It is not a bad thing to do.	Akuyona into embi ukuyenza.
The work took hours.	Umsebenzi wathatha amahora.
You may be traveling too far.	Kungenzeka ukuthi uhamba kakhulu.
He wouldn't be here long enough.	Ubengeke abe lapha isikhathi eside ngokwanele.
And this is obvious.	Futhi kusobala lokhu.
He wants to know what he did.	Ufuna ukwazi ukuthi wenzeni.
Such a large group.	Iqembu elikhulu kangaka.
That's all you need to know right now.	Yilokho kuphela okudingeka ukwazi okwamanje.
Just like that, he asked for more money.	Kanjalo nje, wacela enye imali.
One did the other.	Omunye wenza omunye.
Way and time.	Indlela kanye nesikhathi.
Let me say this about that.	Ake ngisho lokhu ngalokho.
I think about this all the time.	Ngicabanga ngalokhu njalo.
That happened so quickly.	Kwenzeka ngokushesha lokho.
He looked at the picture for a long time.	Wabuka isithombe isikhathi eside.
Still, talking enough.	Noma kunjalo, ukukhuluma ngokwanele.
I wanted so much.	Ngangifuna kakhulu.
She was not the best mother ever.	Wayengeyena umama ongcono kakhulu.
I know that's the only mistake.	Ngiyazi ukuthi iphutha kuphela lelo.
He goes to prison.	Uya ejele.
You will know what to do.	Uzokwazi ukuthi wenzeni.
I got lunch at work.	Ngithole ukudla kwasemini emsebenzini.
Just tonight.	Ebusuku nje.
I'm trying to find out who she really is.	Ngizama ukuthola ukuthi ubani ngempela.
I don't even have to think about it.	Akumele ngize ngicabange ngakho.
Probably, he will never.	Mhlawumbe, akasoze.
But there is the problem.	Kodwa lapho inkinga.
A lot is really true.	Okuningi kuyiqiniso impela.
Always, in everything.	Njalo, kukho konke.
I will not go slow.	Ngeke ngihambe kancane kancane.
So there had to be something there.	Ngakho kwakufanele kube khona okunye lapho.
That's all, really.	Yilokho kuphela, ngempela.
It's hard to sleep.	Kunzima ukulala.
From the top.	Kusukela phezulu.
You know a little bit.	Uyazi kancane.
He did not stop speaking.	Akazange ayeke ukukhuluma.
Here I am again.	Yimi lowo futhi.
But he seemed absent.	Kodwa wabonakala engekho.
Even worse.	Ngisho kabi.
But I'm not sure how I did it.	Kodwa angiqiniseki ukuthi ngikwenze kanjani.
Everyone can do something.	Wonke umuntu angenza okuthile.
I don't see anything about him.	Angiboni lutho ngaye.
Thinking about me, every day for a long time.	Ukucabanga ngami, nsuku zonke isikhathi eside.
Now he is really scared.	Manje uyesaba ngempela.
Yes, he feels good.	Yebo, uzizwa kahle.
It's hard to get into.	Kunzima ukungena.
But in reality, that is not true.	Kodwa empeleni, lokho akulona iqiniso.
He and I.	Naye kanye nami.
He must be with me.	Kumele abe nami.
I'm going right now.	Ngiya khona manje.
But he knew, he knew.	Kodwa wayazi, wayazi.
The teacher came.	Wafika uthisha.
I said, okay.	Ngathi, kulungile.
I like to spend time alone.	Ngithanda ukuchitha isikhathi ngedwa.
We must all go.	Kumele sihambe sonke.
I had no idea this was possible.	Bengingazi ukuthi lokhu kungenzeka.
Or his person.	Noma umuntu wakhe.
Good to have you.	Kuhle ukuba nawe.
It is good that you have done many things.	Kuhle ukuthi wenze izinto eziningi.
But no one else did.	Kodwa akekho omunye owenza lokhu.
But you do not know how wrong you are.	Kodwa awazi ukuthi unephutha kangakanani.
There may be some power there, though.	Kungase kube khona amandla lapho, noma kunjalo.
I just don’t see how.	Angiboni nje ukuthi kanjani.
You must say yes to this.	Kumele uthi yebo kulokhu.
He felt something had to be done.	Wezwa kufanele kwenziwe okuthile.
You need to know something.	Kumele wazi okuthile.
He started his career.	Waqala umsebenzi wakhe.
He is here this morning.	Ukhona namhlanje ekuseni.
Maybe he couldn't say anything.	Mhlawumbe akakwazanga ukusho lutho.
No to that.	Cha kulokho.
There is no exit to it.	Akukho ukuphuma kukho.
He must learn to speak.	Kumele afunde ukukhuluma.
This he will never do here.	Lokhu akasoze akwenza lapha.
Really, well done.	Ngempela, kwenziwe kahle.
He sat down at his desk.	Wahlala phansi etafuleni lakhe.
But you know about it.	Kodwa uyazi ngakho.
I try to find a continuum.	Ngizama ukuthola ukuqhubeka.
He will not be with you.	Angeke abe nawe.
I feel more.	Ngizizwa okwengeziwe.
You better be.	Kungcono ube.
Or do anything.	Noma wenze noma yini.
But that does not have to be.	Kodwa lokho akudingekile ukuba kube njalo.
It could be a bit.	Kungaba kancane.
Good, good book.	Incwadi enhle, enhle.
But he could not do that.	Kodwa akakwazanga ukwenza lokhu.
You already told me that.	Ungitshele lokho kakade.
I do not want to say too much.	Angifuni ukusho okuningi.
Yes, he did.	Yebo, ukwenzile nje.
I hope it is the right thing to do.	Ngethemba ukuthi yinto efanele kulokhu.
He couldn't help it now.	Akakwazanga ukuzibamba manje.
Not a big risk.	Hhayi ingozi enkulu.
Better music than that.	Umculo omuhle kunalokho.
Everything is good enough.	Konke kuhle ngokwanele.
You will be able to come every day.	Uzokwazi ukuza nsuku zonke.
He wants us to go there tonight.	Ufuna siye lapho namuhla ebusuku.
I can't be with you.	Angeke ngikwazi ukuba nawe.
That boy.	Umfana lowo.
We did the job well for the first time.	Senza umsebenzi kahle okokuqala.
I wanted to stay here.	Ngangifuna ukuhlala lapha.
He could be her.	Angaba nguye.
Stop thinking about it.	Yeka ukucabanga ngakho.
We do that instead.	Senza lokho esikhundleni.
In fact, it is possible.	Empeleni, kungenzeka.
He was not sure how he really felt.	Wayengenaso isiqiniseko sokuthi uzizwa kanjani ngempela.
She was afraid of everything about him.	Wayesaba yonke into ngaye.
Good to buy.	Kuhle ukuthenga.
He wasn't really there.	Wayengekho impela .
I knew everyone.	Ngangazi wonke umuntu.
Maybe it would be the same thing now.	Mhlawumbe kungaba yinto efanayo manje.
This is good, because we can't.	Lokhu kuhle, ngoba asikwazi.
Another at the hospital.	Omunye esibhedlela.
But you are definitely there.	Kodwa nakanjani ukhona.
It's not a gun.	Akusona isibhamu.
I think you are better than that.	Ngicabanga ukuthi ungcono kunalokho.
He decided to play next to me.	Wanquma ukudlala eduze kwami.
Yes, that is true.	Yebo kuyiqiniso lokho.
I don't think so well lately.	Angicabangi kahle muva nje.
He was not alone.	Kwakungeyena neze yedwa.
There you are.	Nawe lapho.
One big, one small.	Enye enkulu, enye encane.
Want to know more about us ?.	Ufuna ukwazi okwengeziwe ngathi?.
He has to stop.	Kuzomele ayeke.
I like to do better and get better.	Ngithanda ukwenza ngcono futhi ngithole.
Dad came in.	Wangena ubaba.
And maybe for you.	Futhi mhlawumbe kuwe.
His work is good.	Muhle umsebenzi wakhe.
He must be down.	Kumele abe phansi.
I'm not sure how.	Angiqiniseki ukuthi kanjani.
Simply put, he works at night.	Kalula nje, usebenza ebusuku.
He says it's not a thing.	Uthi akuyona into.
There is always something going on.	Ngihlale kukhona okwenzekayo.
I love anything and everything.	Ngithanda noma yini nakho konke.
And one.	Futhi eyodwa.
He knew he could not stay long.	Wayazi ukuthi wayengeke akwazi ukuhlala isikhathi eside.
Something happened in the house.	Kukhona okwenzekile endlini.
He'll be back tonight.	Uzobuya namhlanje kusihlwa.
You will always feel bad like this.	Uzohlala uzizwa kabi kanje.
The father must go.	Ubaba kumele ahambe.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbe akufanele kube njalo.
Sometimes it can be a lot.	Ngezinye izikhathi kungase kube kuningi.
I think of you all the time too.	Ngicabanga ngawe ngaso sonke isikhathi futhi.
There is no restaurant.	Ayikho indawo yokudlela.
I wanted to do that for so long.	Ngangifuna ukwenza lokho isikhathi eside kangaka.
The whole story.	Indaba yonke.
No, that is not the case with him.	Cha, akukho kuye lokho.
There is only you now.	Kukhona wena kuphela manje.
Maybe it will be better in the morning.	Mhlawumbe kuzoba ngcono ekuseni.
To tell you the truth, it is not a bad idea.	Ukukutshela iqiniso, akuwona umqondo omubi.
It should be a name as before.	Kufanele kube igama njengakuqala.
That was another mistake.	Lelo kube elinye iphutha.
To find out more.	Ukuze uthole okuningi.
Something needs to be done there, though.	Kukhona okudingeka kwenziwe lapho, noma kunjalo.
It's been all day.	Kube usuku lonke.
He said he wanted to talk to me.	Wathi ufuna ukukhuluma nami.
No no, not yes.	Hhayi cha, hhayi yebo.
I really tried to work as hard as I could.	Ngazama ngempela ukusebenza kahle ngangokunokwenzeka.
But if he wants to, then that's fine.	Kodwa uma efuna, kulungile.
For most of my life, you know.	Cishe impilo yami yonke, uyazi.
We want a reason.	Sifuna isizathu.
He asked if she would like to sleep.	Wabuza ukuthi angathanda yini ukulala.
He pretends not to know.	Wenza sengathi akazi.
And you are very wrong.	Futhi unephutha kakhulu.
Because I think there is no such thing.	Ngoba ngicabanga ukuthi ayikho into enjalo.
But not before.	Kodwa hhayi ngaphambili.
I got to it first, but just.	Ngifike kukho kuqala, kodwa nje.
I want more.	Ngifuna okuningi.
Not just in the morning.	Hhayi nje ekuseni.
Apparently, he went too far.	Ngokusobala, wahamba kakhulu.
As it happened, he could do nothing.	Njengoba kwenzeka, wayengeke enze lutho.
I think it's really true.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kuyiqiniso impela.
So in the office.	Ngakho ehhovisi.
You told me that today.	Ungitshele lokho namuhla.
She is always very happy.	Uhlala ejabule kakhulu.
Everyone wanted to do something.	Wonke umuntu wayefuna ukwenza okuthile.
That will not happen to us.	Lokho ngeke kwenzeke kithi.
I need to find my reason again with it.	Ngidinga ukuthola isizathu sami futhi ngayo.
I know that to be true.	Ngiyazi ukuthi kuyiqiniso lokho.
I apologize yesterday afternoon.	Ngiyaxolisa izolo ntambama.
Good time.	Isikhathi esihle.
I do not know tomorrow morning.	Angazi kusasa ekuseni.
That starts first.	Lokho kuqala kuqala.
In the end, he did just that.	Ekugcineni, wenza kanjalo.
Everything else is fine.	Konke okunye kulungile.
At least he speaks as he does.	Okungenani ukhuluma njengoba enjalo.
I think at one time.	Ngicabanga ngesikhathi esisodwa.
You want a new life.	Ufuna impilo entsha.
Let me hear about you, too.	Ake ngizwe ngawe, nami.
I should not know all this.	Akufanele ngikwazi konke lokhu.
You look like you need one.	Ubukeka sengathi udinga eyodwa.
And it is true that he is actually a child.	Futhi kuyiqiniso ukuthi empeleni ingane.
I would never have heard of it.	Bengingeke ngizwe ngakho.
She found out she was happy, actually.	Wathola ukuthi ujabule, empeleni.
Another word.	Elinye izwi.
We need help with everything.	Sidinga usizo ngakho konke.
This is probably a mistake.	Lokhu mhlawumbe iphutha.
But he does now.	Kodwa wenza manje.
Food at the end.	Ukudla ekugcineni.
I'm glad we went.	Ngiyajabula ngokuthi siye.
This has happened recently.	Lokhu kwenzeke muva nje.
Everyone really wants to be with you.	Wonke umuntu ufuna ukuba nawe empeleni.
At least, that's what he said.	Okungenani, yilokho akusho.
Nowhere in the world.	Akukho ndawo emhlabeni wonke.
At least here.	Okungenani lapha.
He did not want to go.	Wayengafuni ukuya.
And because there has to be something else.	Futhi ngoba kufanele kube khona okunye.
My mother was not there.	Umama wayengekho.
Dad can be very difficult.	Ubaba angaba nzima kakhulu.
Problem problems.	Inkinga amaphutha.
You have a big mistake.	Unephutha elikhulu.
There is no right or wrong answer here.	Ayikho impendulo efanele noma engalungile lapha.
And, as you know, you can do this.	Futhi, njengoba wazi, ungakwenza lokhu.
He wanted to know what to do.	Wayefuna ukwazi ukuthi enzeni.
He should always say this.	Kufanele akusho njalo lokhu.
He did not even know why he came here.	Wayengazi nokuthi kungani eze lapha.
You need to log in.	Udinga ukungena.
I'm not sure why.	Angiqiniseki ukuthi kungani kungaba njalo.
Not you.	Cha nawe.
And it will be this time.	Futhi kuzoba njalo ngalesi sikhathi.
And there should be.	Futhi kufanele kube khona.
Once, just once.	Kanye, kanye nje.
So it may be for a while.	Ngakho kungase kube isikhashana.
But now it's time for me to go.	Kodwa manje sekuyisikhathi sokuthi ngihambe.
Or at least one good one.	Noma okungenani eyodwa enhle.
Great meeting.	Umhlangano omkhulu.
Yes, you can do that too.	Yebo, nawe ungakwenza lokho.
Death every day.	Ukufa nsuku zonke.
Yeah, okay, okay.	Yebo, kulungile, kulungile.
That's all he needs to know.	Yilokho kuphela okudingeka akwazi.
More often than not, it never happened.	Kaningi kunalokho, akuzange kwenzeke.
Yes, that's very good.	Yebo, kuhle kakhulu lokho.
I had to see.	Kwadingeka ngibone.
It does not matter what you did yesterday.	Akusho lutho ukuthi wenzeni izolo.
I need an opinion here.	Ngidinga umbono lapha.
But it will go well.	Kodwa uzohamba kahle.
But first you have to stay.	Kodwa okokuqala kufanele uhlale.
But seeing something completely different.	Kodwa ukubona enye into ngokuphelele.
He is very young.	Umfana kakhulu.
I mean, you can, but you shouldn't.	Ngisho, ungakwazi, kodwa akufanele.
He'll have to do something about it.	Kuzofanele enze okuthile ngalokho.
i think you !.	ngicabanga wena!.
You're just waiting.	Ulindele nje.
It's the best thing.	Yinto engcono kakhulu.
He seemed alone.	Wayebonakala eyedwa.
As he did with me.	Njengoba enza nami.
There is nothing more there.	Akukho okunye nje lapho.
He must remain so.	Kumele ahlale enjalo.
Everyone took the money.	Wonke umuntu wathatha imali.
But he asked.	Kodwa wabuza.
The greatest mother in the world.	Umama omkhulu emhlabeni.
I have found that he can not sleep at night.	Ngiye ngithole ukuthi akakwazi ukulala ebusuku.
Not a very big name.	Akulona igama elikhulu impela.
You want something from me.	Ufuna okuthile kimi.
Maybe you say.	Mhlawumbe usho.
That he has never been.	Ukuthi akakaze abe khona.
He is with you.	Ukhona kanye nawe.
You can swim completely.	Ungakwazi ukubhukuda ngokuphelele.
But he is not visible.	Kodwa akabonakali.
Still, there is a place.	Noma kunjalo, kukhona indawo.
Very good, thank you.	Kuhle kakhulu, ngiyabonga.
He thinks so now.	Ucabanga kanjalo manje.
And what .	Yini futhi .
I should have known first.	Bekumele ngikwazi kuqala.
Anyway, that's me for now.	Noma kunjalo, yimi lowo okwamanje.
I got it now.	Ngithole manje.
That's all there is to it.	Yilokho kuphela lapho.
Only he knows what he did.	Nguye kuphela owaziyo ukuthi wenzeni.
He might be a better person.	Angase abe umuntu ongcono.
How can this be?	Kungenzeka kanjani lokhu?.
Still, he said nothing.	Noma kunjalo, akazange asho lutho.
So he asked if he could try one.	Ngakho wabuza ukuthi angakwazi yini ukuzama eyodwa.
We just won't be.	Ngeke nje sibe.
We know you will win.	Siyazi ukuthi uzowina.
My doctor was not helpful.	Udokotela wami akazange abe usizo.
You do not need to cry.	Awudingi ukukhala.
It's a little okay.	Kulungile kancane.
It has to be him.	Kumele kube nguyena.
We both know why you are leaving.	Sobabili siyazi ukuthi kungani uhamba.
This is her little boy.	Indodana yakhe encane lena.
It will take longer than that.	Kuzothatha isikhathi eside kunalokho.
I'm happy.	Ngijabule.
You are very happy.	Impela ujabule kakhulu.
It's hard to say that now.	Kunzima ukusho lokho manje.
So maybe not him.	Ngakho mhlawumbe hhayi yena.
My family knows.	Umndeni wami uyazi.
Please sit down again.	Ngicela uhlale phansi futhi.
Now you really have to go to college.	Manje empeleni kufanele uye ekolishi.
And not just for him.	Futhi hhayi ngaye kuphela.
Probably immediately.	Mhlawumbe ngaso leso sikhathi.
I'm not sure what you did about it.	Angazi kahle ukuthi wenzeni ngakho.
Really, you should go now.	Ngempela, kufanele uhambe manje.
You do not have to keep talking.	Akudingekile ukuthi uhlale ukhuluma.
I want to tell you.	Ngifuna ukukutshela .
I'll be a mother there.	Ngizoba umama lapho.
Out of breath.	Waphuma umoya.
Not just an idea.	Hhayi nje umqondo.
No, stop that.	Cha, yeka lokho.
You can't find out what's wrong.	Awukwazi ukuthola ukuthi yini engalungile.
There has to be someone.	Kufanele kube khona umuntu.
There is no such thing here.	Akukho lokho lapha.
The way he said it.	Indlela asho ngayo .
And not exactly.	Futhi hhayi kahle.
One walks alone.	Omunye uhamba yedwa.
No, rather.	Cha, kunalokho.
Too much time.	Isikhathi esiningi kakhulu .
He must be what he is.	Kumelwe abe yilokho ayikho.
I want to know more about this.	Ngifuna ukwazi okwengeziwe ngalokhu.
Any way to do this.	Noma iyiphi indlela yokwenza lokhu.
My father was never there.	Ubaba akakaze abe khona.
Is your friend.	Ingabe umngane wakho.
I live next to her.	Ngihlala eduze kwakhe.
I don't really know.	Empeleni angazi.
I have to get a car.	Kufanele ngithole imoto.
There is no one on earth.	Akukho muntu emhlabeni.
For months, he thought.	Izinyanga, wayecabanga.
But is that possible ?.	Kodwa kungenzeka kunjalo?.
Maybe you shouldn’t wait.	Mhlawumbe akufanele ukulinda.
He is not alone.	Akekho yedwa.
And, lies.	Futhi, amanga.
I'm sure that's just the way it is.	Ngiqinisekile ukuthi kunjalo nje.
You need to do something more.	Kuzomele wenze okuthile okwengeziwe.
But again this is your choice.	Kodwa futhi lokhu ukukhetha kwakho.
I think everyone is wrong at this point.	Ngicabanga ukuthi wonke umuntu unephutha ngalesi sikhathi.
Everyone looks happy enough.	Wonke umuntu ubukeka ejabule ngokwanele.
I can't think of it right now.	Angikwazi ukucabanga ngakho njengamanje.
Me, that's right.	Mina, kunjalo.
I don’t think about it much.	Angicabangi ngakho kakhulu.
You know he couldn't.	Uyazi akakwazanga.
I know it will take another few months.	Ngiyazi ukuthi kuzothatha ezinye izinyanga ezimbalwa.
I did one thing well today.	Ngenze into eyodwa kahle namuhla.
He started out of the room.	Waqala waphuma ekamelweni.
He stayed with her.	Wahlala naye.
Water means people.	Amanzi asho abantu.
But we are not all in this.	Kodwa asikho sonke kulokhu.
He just did a lot.	Wenza kakhulu nje.
I wish I could.	Ngifisa sengathi .
Or you say, you better get somebody else.	Noma uthi, kungcono uthole omunye umuntu.
A few hours, actually.	Amahora ambalwa, empeleni.
But that is not the time.	Kodwa lokho akusona isikhathi.
I did not go to you.	Angizange ngiye kuwe.
This must have sounded to him.	Kumele ukuthi lokhu kuzwakala kuye.
To.	Ukuze .
My mother, a little.	Umama wami, kancane.
But last night.	Kodwa izolo ebusuku.
He just wouldn't have that in him.	Ubengeke nje abe nakho lokho kuye.
The view is beautiful.	Umbono muhle.
I'll have to think about that.	Kuzofanele ngicabange ngalokho.
There is a story.	Kukhona indaba.
But a good question.	Kodwa umbuzo omuhle.
He is the best player in the world.	Ungumdlali owenza kahle kakhulu emhlabeni.
I wouldn't say that now.	Bengingeke ngisho lokho manje.
And yes, it's good to have you too.	Futhi yebo, kuhle ukuba nawe futhi.
And maybe the police.	Futhi mhlawumbe amaphoyisa.
He didn't even think about it.	Akazange ngisho acabange ngakho.
There is a way, of course.	Kukhona indlela, kunjalo.
But you do not want to do that.	Kodwa awufuni ukwenza lokho.
I hope you do more.	Ngethemba ukuthi uzokwenza okwengeziwe.
He is eating his dinner.	Udla isidlo sakhe sakusihlwa.
He didn't want her to know he knew.	Wayengafuni ukuthi azi ukuthi uyazi.
I hope that doesn't happen to me.	Ngethemba ukuthi lokho ngeke kwenzeke kimi.
This is my answer.	Lena impendulo yami.
That was all the boy needed.	Yilokho kuphela okwakudingeka umfana.
Well, well, very good.	Kulungile, kulungile, kuhle kakhulu.
I hope you will be able to attend.	Ngethemba ukuthi uzokwazi ukuba khona.
I have to see a dog.	Kufanele ngibone inja.
He will not be able to get a job.	Ngeke akwazi ukuthola umsebenzi.
I know enough to do it.	Ngazi ngokwanele ukukwenza.
All work.	Umsebenzi wonke.
Good team too.	Iqembu elihle futhi.
And that is good too.	Futhi lokho kuhle futhi.
Better health.	Impilo engcono.
Yes, indeed.	Yebo kuyiqiniso impela.
That's where he wants to be.	Khona lapho efuna khona.
But you must find the truth.	Kodwa kufanele uthole iqiniso.
The question is where and how.	Umbuzo uthi kuphi futhi kanjani.
He was probably scared.	Cishe wayesaba.
He thought nothing of it.	Wayengacabangi lutho ngakho.
But he was not in her.	Kodwa wayengekho kuye.
Where he can be.	Lapho angaba khona yena .
But maybe it's better this way.	Kodwa mhlawumbe kungcono ngale ndlela.
You will not tell me.	Ngeke ungitshele.
He did not want to live this way.	Wayengafuni ukuphila ngale ndlela.
So he did this on the floor.	Ngakho wenza le nto phansi.
Work went slowly.	Umsebenzi wahamba kancane.
I have never told anyone myself.	Angikaze ngitshele muntu nami.
He could not see what she looked like.	Akakwazanga ukubona ukuthi ubukeka kanjani.
A place where everyone knows your name.	Indawo lapho wonke umuntu azi igama lakho.
He wanted to continue.	Wayefuna ukuqhubeka.
A lot of food that.	Ukudla okuningi lokho.
That would not be good for both of us.	Lokho ngeke kube kuhle kithi sobabili.
There is another view.	Kukhona futhi omunye umbono.
That's why he sits in the back.	Yingakho ehlala ngemuva.
To be there.	Ukuze ube kukho.
There is no reason why it should.	Asikho isizathu sokuthi kufanele.
Yes, too much.	Yebo, kuningi kakhulu.
He knew everyone in the office.	Wayazi wonke umuntu ehhovisi.
Speaking of which, we need to go.	Ukukhuluma ngakho, sidinga ukuhamba.
Let me just tell you.	Ake ngikutshele nje.
If so, something else must be done.	Uma kunjalo, kufanele kwenziwe okunye.
Obviously no one is so good.	Ngokusobala akekho umuntu omuhle kakhulu.
We need more sleep.	Sidinga ukulala okwengeziwe.
I got my coffee.	Ngithole ikhofi lami.
You may already be there.	Kungenzeka ukuthi usevele ukhona.
I knew the best way.	Ngangazi indlela engcono.
I could not do that now.	Angikwazanga ukwenza lokho manje.
See the people behind him.	Abone abantu ngemuva kwakhe.
Please talk to you.	Ngicela ukukhuluma nawe.
It would be a good thing.	Kungaba yinto enhle.
He also could not possibly.	Naye akakwazanga mhlawumbe.
I know you know.	Ngiyazi ukuthi uyakwazi yini.
He may be.	Angase abe njalo.
From this it became clear that this was not the case.	Kulokhu kwacaca ukuthi akunjalo.
Obviously I don’t want to do this.	Ngokusobala angifuni ukwenza lokhu.
In the office all morning.	Ehhovisi ekuseni yonke.
And I say.	Futhi ngisho .
Not too much, but a little bit.	Hhayi kakhulu kakhulu, kodwa kancane.
I mean, he can't control himself.	Ngisho, angeke akwazi ukuzibamba.
That's all right.	Kulungile ngempela.
So, of course, you have to go.	Ngakho, kunjalo, kufanele uhambe.
Slowly, to tell you the truth.	Kancane kancane, ukukutshela iqiniso.
I will not be happy there.	Angeke ngijabule lapho.
Sometimes even a few months.	Ngezinye izikhathi izinyanga ezimbalwa ngisho.
Have you heard anything.	Uke wezwa okuthile.
A very good age.	Iminyaka kahle kakhulu.
You just want to say.	Ufuna nje ukusho.
And why now.	Futhi kungani manje.
You need to do well.	Udinga ukwenza kahle.
Sometimes, too.	Ngezinye izikhathi, kakhulu.
It's time for him to speak now.	Sekuyisikhathi sokuthi akhulume manje.
I don’t see close enough.	Angiboni eduze ngokwanele.
That's better.	Lokho kungcono.
You just love pictures.	Uthanda izithombe nje.
Something had to be done, and immediately.	Kwakufanele kwenziwe okuthile, futhi ngokushesha.
Not a phone call.	Hhayi ucingo.
And everything you went through.	Futhi konke odlule kukho.
Hearing music.	Ukuzwa umculo.
The idea did not go anywhere.	Umqondo awuzange uye ndawo.
Why might that be ?.	Kungani kungase kube lokho?.
He could not choose one.	Akakwazanga ukukhetha eyodwa.
And not just me, everyone.	Futhi hhayi mina kuphela, wonke umuntu.
So, please do not do that.	Ngakho, ngicela ungakwenzi lokho.
I can't help it now.	Angikwazi ukuzibamba manje.
No father wants to hear that.	Akekho ubaba ofuna ukuzwa lokho.
But there is no answer.	Kodwa ayikho impendulo.
Looks like no one really knows what happened.	Kubukeka sengathi akekho owaziyo ukuthi kwenzekeni.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Akukho okubi nhlobo.
That's just it.	Lowo nje.
He was just thinking about food.	Wayecabanga nje ukudla.
More to do.	Okuningi okumele kwenziwe.
There is only this.	Kukhona lokhu kuphela.
It may and may not happen now.	Kungenzeka futhi kungenzeka manje.
The question lies here.	Umbuzo ulele lapha.
Or next month.	Noma ngenyanga ezayo.
I just want to live my life.	Ngifuna nje ukuphila impilo yami.
You may say so.	Kungenzeka ukuthi usho njalo.
Because you do not know how to drive.	Ngoba awazi ukushayela.
That would be a wonderful gift.	Kungaba isipho esihle leso.
But I could not.	Kodwa angikwazanga.
I do not want to live like that.	Angifuni ukuphila kanjalo.
He did not think he wanted to go home.	Wayengacabangi ukuthi ufuna ukuya ekhaya.
He seemed out of place.	Wayebonakala engekho ndawo.
Money, almost.	Imali, cishe.
Money is not all.	Imali akuyona yonke.
That's really a big problem.	Yilokho ngempela inkinga enkulu.
He sat down with him and began to eat.	Wahlala phansi naye waqala ukudla.
Now he just does.	Manje wenza nje.
But he is very happy alone.	Kodwa ujabule kakhulu yedwa.
I can't wait to do these again.	Angisakwazi ukulinda ukwenza lezi futhi.
I know my mom wants me to stay with her.	Ngiyazi ukuthi umama ufuna ngihlale naye.
You need something to go.	Udinga okuthile ukuze uhambe.
He was wearing a robe.	Wayegqoke ingubo.
He sat down and thought.	Wahlala phansi wacabanga.
You may be wrong.	Kungenzeka ukuthi unephutha.
You also know that you are not human.	Uyazi nawe ukuthi awuyena umuntu.
In fact he is.	Empeleni nguye.
He stepped in and looked up.	Wangena kahle wabheka phezulu.
Mom would have said something.	Umama ngabe usho okuthile.
I didn't want to be her friend.	Ngangingafuni ukuba umngane wakhe.
What a bad idea.	Yeka umqondo omubi.
But no one does such a thing.	Kodwa akekho owenza into enjalo.
Just right here.	Khona lapha nje.
You better stay home today.	Kungcono uhlale endlini namuhla.
This, too, seems possible.	Lokhu, nakho, kubonakala kungenzeka.
Or at least, it shouldn’t be.	Noma okungenani, akufanele kube.
He loves me the same way I do.	Uthanda ngendlela efanayo nami.
Nothing, your chance.	Lutho, ithuba lakho.
Not to mention too much.	Hhayi ukukhuluma kakhulu.
That's you and me.	Mina nawe lowo.
Not that this happened to me.	Hhayi ukuthi lokhu kwenzeka kimi.
He wouldn't know that.	Wayengeke akwazi lokho.
Seeing, that's right.	Ukubona, kunjalo.
But now he heard something else.	Kodwa manje wezwa okunye.
No one should be able to do that.	Akekho okufanele akwazi ukwenza lokho.
I'm sorry, he said.	Ngiyaxolisa, usho kanje.
I am happy to do the job.	Ngijabule ukwenza umsebenzi.
He looked after my belongings.	Wabheka izinto zami.
Or, you do not need to.	Noma, awudingi.
And to go with it.	Futhi ukuya ngakho.
I feel it all the time.	Ngizwa ngaso sonke isikhathi.
From your world.	Kusukela emhlabeni wakho.
You will never know exactly when.	Ngeke wazi kahle ukuthi nini.
I would really like to know more about you.	Ngingathanda ngempela ukwazi okwengeziwe ngawe.
I saw something.	Ngabona okuthile.
You just have to stay there.	Kufanele nje uhlale lapho.
He seemed very young.	Wabonakala esemncane kakhulu.
I know the problem is not in my end.	Ngiyazi ukuthi inkinga ayikho ekugcineni kwami.
My fault, actually, or maybe not.	Iphutha lami, empeleni, noma mhlawumbe cha.
I feel it every day.	Ngizwa nsuku zonke.
He did not come to school today.	Akazange eze esikoleni namuhla.
This is exactly what happened.	Yebo impela lokhu okwenzekile.
He is tall enough.	Mude ngokwanele.
He knew he had to do something.	Wayazi ukuthi kwakufanele enze okuthile.
He would never do such a thing.	Akasoze enze into enjalo.
I think a lot.	Ngicabanga kakhulu.
We did not go to him.	Asizange siye kuye.
He also knows a lot.	Naye uyazi kakhulu.
He can't really say.	Ngeke ngempela asho.
He should know better, he really should.	Kufanele azi kangcono, kufanele ngempela.
Not there yet.	Hhayi lapho okwamanje.
The same thing happens all the time.	Kwenzeka into efanayo njalo.
He lives with me.	Uhlala nami.
You are the first one in this.	Uwena kuqala kulokhu.
But that is not the whole picture.	Kodwa akusona neze isithombe sonke.
He absolutely refused to speak.	Wenqaba ngokuphelele ukukhuluma.
Not water, he thought.	Hhayi amanzi, wacabanga.
I can't play boy.	Angikwazi ukudlala umfana.
This is very difficult.	Kunzima impela lokhu.
We must have time.	Kufanele sibe nesikhathi.
Okay there.	Kulungile lapho.
Same thing with this.	Into efanayo nalokhu.
He does not want to go home with me.	Akafuni ukuya nami ekhaya.
Lots of people there.	Abantu abaningi lapho.
I just want to sleep.	Ngifuna ukulala kuphela.
At least in the end.	Okungenani ekugcineni.
He will not give up.	Ngeke ayeke.
We want to do better.	Sifuna ukwenza kangcono.
Still, it is true.	Noma kunjalo, kuyiqiniso.
It may be a lie.	Kungase kube amanga.
But something new could happen.	Kodwa kungenzeka into entsha.
He got a test.	Wathola ukuhlolwa.
That's the plan.	Yilokho uhlelo .
Or rather, my voice.	Noma kunalokho, izwi lami.
And there is a problem.	Futhi kukhona inkinga.
How he.	Kanjani yena.
I just need to do a few things.	Ngidinga nje ukwenza izinto ezimbalwa.
Now that.	Manje lokho.
What’s worse is that we can’t make everyone do that.	Okubi kakhulu ukuthi ngeke senze wonke umuntu enze lokho.
I hope it doesn't happen.	Ngethemba ukuthi ngeke kwenzeke.
We did not go to the hospital.	Asizange siye esibhedlela.
Choosing can be difficult.	Ukukhetha kungaba nzima.
Probably too close.	Mhlawumbe eduze kakhulu.
I mean, sure, that's right.	Ngisho, impela, kunjalo.
In this case it really happened.	Kulokhu kwenzeka ngempela.
You go where you want right now.	Uya lapho ofuna khona okwamanje.
He could not help.	Akakwazanga ukusiza.
That something is wrong with me.	Ukuthi kukhona okubi kwami.
Where there are people.	Lapho kukhona abantu.
You have to go all the way.	Kufanele uhambe yonke indlela.
I will not do anything.	Ngeke ngenze lutho.
And that happens often.	Futhi lokho kwenzeka kaningi.
Did you realize that maybe not.	Ingabe waqaphela ukuthi mhlawumbe akunjalo.
She's beautiful, she's very beautiful.	Muhle, muhle kakhulu.
Her family is beautiful too.	Umndeni wakhe muhle futhi.
He could not get out of work.	Akakwazanga ukuphuma emsebenzini.
Or, he knew.	Noma, wayazi.
Is that it.	Ingabe lokho .
All life.	Konke ukuphila.
But, my father was surprised.	Kodwa, ubaba wamangala.
And you don't have to take my word for it.	Futhi awudingi ukuthatha izwi lami ngakho.
He just does his thing.	Eyenza nje into yakhe.
I'll go with it '.	Ngizohamba ngayo'.
I don't like it at all.	Angithandi nhlobo.
I have to find out what you mean.	Kufanele ngithole ukuthi usho ukuthini.
Always, and at the same time.	Ngaso sonke isikhathi, futhi ngaso leso sikhathi.
It's hard to talk about it now.	Kunzima ukukhuluma ngakho manje.
I can't drive.	Angikwazi ukushayela.
Yes, but not always.	Yebo, kodwa hhayi njalo.
Everyone should have it.	Wonke umuntu kufanele abe naye.
No, there is no such thing.	Cha, ayikho into enjalo.
But it is better not to do it.	Kodwa kuhle uma ungakwenzi.
Death is out of here.	Ukufa ukuphuma lapha.
You should know too.	Kufanele ukwazi nawe.
Tell me about what happened.	Ngitshele ngalokho okwenzekile.
Something new.	Enye into entsha.
He looked like he was thinking of her.	Wayebukeka sengathi ucabanga ngaye.
I asked to sit down.	Ngacela ukuhlala phansi.
Everyone had to come at once.	Wonke umuntu kwakufanele afike kanye kanye.
There is no one around.	Akukho muntu eduze.
That, of course, is not the case.	Lokho, akulona iqiniso.
He tried to fix it.	Wazama ukulungisa.
That's good, if you like something like that.	Kuhle lokho, uma uthanda into enjalo.
Not there.	Hhayi lapho .
But you are the only child.	Kodwa uyingane eyedwa.
Everyone will know you did it.	Wonke umuntu uzokwazi ukuthi ukwenzile.
I did not want to know anything.	Ngangingafuni ukwazi lutho.
That's why they know nothing.	Yingakho bengazi lutho.
He is the only one here who is capable.	Uyena yedwa lapha onekhono.
I hear the kids in the back.	Ngizwa izingane ngemuva.
He asked me many times about him.	Wangibuza kaningi ngaye.
I made my decision.	Ngenza isinqumo sami.
Imagine sleeping.	Acabange ukulala.
I need to hear your voice.	Ngidinga ukuzwa izwi lakho.
He talks a lot too.	Ukhuluma kakhulu futhi.
Or a new book.	Noma incwadi entsha.
Still, you can do it.	Noma kunjalo, ungakwenza.
We did not and will not.	Asizange futhi ngeke.
Probably not sometimes.	Mhlawumbe akunjalo ngezinye izikhathi.
I wanted lunch.	Ngangifuna ukudla kwasemini.
He heard her cry.	Wezwa ukukhala kwakhe.
Nice bike.	Ibhayisikili elihle.
But stop sitting.	Kodwa yeka ukuhlala.
And not once.	Futhi hhayi kanye.
Maybe some flowers at a time.	Mhlawumbe ezinye izimbali kanye ngesikhathi.
Not much, but still something else.	Hhayi okuningi, kodwa namanje okunye.
I don't want to play again today.	Angifuni ukudlala futhi namuhla.
He realized three things at that time.	Waqaphela izinto ezintathu ngaleso sikhathi.
I need to see, to think.	Ngidinga ukubona, ukucabanga.
I always ask to be present.	Ngihlale ngicela ukuba khona.
I thought, maybe.	Ngacabanga, mhlawumbe .
I had no idea it would be so good.	Ngangingazi ukuthi kungaba kuhle kangako.
Nothing, it seems to me.	Lutho, kubonakala kimi.
And not just anyone.	Futhi hhayi nje noma ubani.
Or even a day.	Noma ngisho usuku.
I want him back badly.	Ngifuna abuye kabi.
Or my books.	Noma izincwadi zami.
His place.	Indawo yakhe.
And he is just like me.	Futhi ufana nami.
But he was not.	Kodwa akazange abe njalo.
But you really want to do something.	Kodwa empeleni ufuna ukwenza okuthile.
That can always happen to you.	Lokho kungenzeka njalo kuwe.
I have to tell you.	Kuzomele ngikutshele .
Not until, well, too long.	Hhayi kuze kube, kuhle, isikhathi eside kakhulu.
You have to tell me everything.	Kufanele ungitshele konke.
I do not believe he is willing.	Angikholwa ukuthi uzimisele.
Not after all that happened.	Hhayi ngemva kwakho konke okwenzekile.
Crying about it.	Ukukhala ngakho.
Yes, he thought he would.	Yebo, wayecabanga ukuthi uzokwenza.
It looks like that to me.	Kubukeka kanjalo kimi.
So, all right, wherever you go.	Ngakho, kulungile, lapho uya khona.
I need to get out of the house.	Ngidinga ukuphuma ekhaya.
For me, that's right.	Ngami, lokho kunjalo.
Or you probably did.	Noma cishe wenza.
You are happy, and you are happy.	Ujabule, futhi ujabule.
And you mean it.	Futhi usho wena.
It would be easy, no.	Ngabe kuzoba lula, cha.
I got there first.	Ngifike kuqala lapho.
Tomorrow morning.	Kusasa kusasa.
Even if you are.	Noma ngabe wena .
He seems to be able to speak.	Kubonakala sengathi uyakwazi ukukhuluma.
We need to keep going.	Sidinga ukuqhubeka kahle.
He used to be a teacher, always a teacher.	Wake waba uthisha, njalo uthisha.
He has never done this before.	Akakaze enze kanje ngaphambilini.
Maybe you need to learn more.	Mhlawumbe udinga ukufunda okwengeziwe.
This just sounds.	Lokhu kuzwakala nje.
I feel like it is not, not at all.	Ngizizwa sengathi akunjalo, hhayi lutho.
I just don't like you to know.	Angikuthandi nje ukuthi uyazi.
We want to see you again.	Sifuna ukukubona futhi.
He wanted to spend more time with her.	Wayefuna ukuchitha isikhathi esiningi naye.
Probably no one can do it.	Mhlawumbe akukho muntu angakwenza.
So, you never knew.	Ngakho, awuzange wazi.
I just got it in the morning.	Ngithole nje ekuseni.
He died before that could happen.	Washona ngaphambi kokuba lokho kwenzeke.
I didn't want to have sex with her anymore.	Ngangingafuni ukulala naye futhi.
And that is what we should do.	Futhi yilokho okufanele sikwenze.
No thanks.	Cha, ngiyabonga.
You do not think so.	Awucabangi kanjalo.
First, he did not speak.	Okokuqala, akazange akhulume.
Anything in the world he would like or should have.	Noma yini emhlabeni angathanda noma kufanele.
Rather without me.	Kunalokho ngaphandle kwami.
That is why he speaks so harshly.	Yingakho ekhuluma kabi.
It is not the same place at all.	Akuyona indawo efanayo nhlobo.
Almost every night.	Cishe njalo ebusuku.
You should go with us immediately.	Kufanele uhambe nathi ngokushesha.
And it's good too.	Futhi kuhle futhi.
He would probably be there all day and probably for a long time.	Cishe wayezoba khona usuku lonke futhi mhlawumbe isikhathi eside.
Thank you so much for everything.	Ngiyabonga kakhulu ngakho konke.
And you told me everything.	Futhi ungitshele konke.
Not here anyway.	Hhayi lapha noma kunjalo.
The problem was he was afraid of people.	Inkinga wayesaba abantu.
So maybe not.	Ngakho mhlawumbe akunjalo.
That will probably happen next week.	Lokho cishe kuzokwenzeka ngesonto elizayo.
This can be your reality.	Lokhu kungaba iqiniso lakho.
I will not always do this.	Ngeke ngenze njalo kulokhu.
Today, choosing can be very difficult.	Namuhla, ukukhetha kungaba nzima kakhulu.
And neither did he.	Futhi naye akazange.
Properly, it is.	Ngendlela efanele, kunjalo.
I think we got better.	Ngicabanga ukuthi sibe ngcono.
I'm not sure how I do it.	Angiqiniseki ukuthi ngenza kanjani.
Speaking your truth.	Ukukhuluma iqiniso lakho.
More was needed.	Kwadingeka okunye okwengeziwe.
Will this ever happen?	Ingabe lokhu kuzokwenzeka?
He is not there at all.	Akekho ngokuphelele lapho.
I'm sorry, you have to go with me.	Ngiyaxolisa, kuzomele uhambe nami.
No, too many years.	Cha, iminyaka eminingi kakhulu.
So I did not want to do this.	Ngakho ngangingafuni ukwenza lokhu.
I wish we didn't know that.	Sengathi asikwazi lokho.
That's a bad choice.	Lokho ukukhetha okubi.
He doesn't want to find out.	Akafuni ukuthola.
Not so much.	Hhayi kakhulu kangako.
I asked about his health.	Ngabuza impilo yakhe.
Almost everything.	Cishe ngakho konke.
But, now it means nothing.	Kodwa, manje akusho lutho.
Great thing, he says.	Into enkulu, usho.
So he went with him.	Ngakho wahamba naye.
It happens almost always.	Kwenzeka cishe njalo.
In a good way it is.	Ngendlela enhle kunjalo.
And probably not.	Futhi mhlawumbe ngeke.
That would be great.	Lokho kuzoba kuhle kakhulu.
The idea is to say no.	Umqondo uthi cha.
I think we did a great job at that.	Ngicabanga ukuthi senze umsebenzi omuhle kakhulu kulokho.
You should not say.	Akufanele usho.
He did not know much about his work.	Wayengazi okuningi ngomsebenzi wakhe.
He was not sure how he would know.	Wayengenaso isiqiniseko sokuthi uzokwazi kanjani.
He may make my job easier or harder.	Angase enze umsebenzi wami ube lula noma ube nzima.
He took his own life.	Wathatha ukuphila kwakhe.
Or you are very happy.	Noma ujabule kakhulu.
Yes, in the world.	Yebo, emhlabeni.
But, it is true.	Kodwa, kuyiqiniso.
He tried to talk to me anyway.	Wazama ukukhuluma nami noma kunjalo.
You need to drink and get some energy.	Udinga ukuphuza futhi uthole amandla.
That's the only mistake.	Yilokho kuphela iphutha.
Today is not the day.	Namuhla akulona usuku.
You read really hard.	Ufunda kanzima impela.
That would be a real try, you know.	Lokho kungaba ukuzama ngempela, uyazi.
Please do this.	Ngicela wenze lokhu.
True.	Iqiniso .
It will not be easy to hear this.	Ngeke kube lula ukuzwa lokhu.
He took it slowly.	Wathatha kancane kancane.
Build it if you have to.	Wakhe uma kufanele.
He talks to me a lot.	Ukhuluma nami kakhulu.
Yes, it will not be done.	Yebo, ngeke kwenziwe.
Good, good for you.	Kuhle, kuhle kuwe.
To think that is just a lot.	Ukucabanga ukuthi kuningi nje.
So if you want.	Ngakho uma ufuna.
I will do some.	Ngizokwenza ezinye.
Or, at least he tried.	Noma, okungenani wazama.
You think you know.	Ucabanga ukuthi uyazi.
Someone had to say something.	Kwakufanele umuntu asho okuthile.
He does not have such a thing.	Akanayo into enjalo.
Because of him and you.	Ngenxa yakhe kanye nawe.
The problem is he doesn't know how.	Inkinga akazi ukuthi kanjani.
I feel really happy about that.	Ngizizwa ngijabule ngempela ngalokho.
He is sleeping well.	Ulele kahle.
I'm not bad.	Angiyena omubi.
That's not the way it should be.	Akuyona indlela okufanele kube ngayo.
You want to know that.	Ufuna ukwazi lokho.
Staying there.	Ukuhlala lapho.
He said he could see it.	Uthe uyakwazi ukukubona.
This afternoon, actually.	Namuhla ntambama, empeleni.
He asked to speak with me.	Wacela ukukhuluma nami.
How is that, you say ?.	Kanjani lokho, usho?.
No, not at all.	Cha, akukho kulokho.
maybe.	mhlawumbe.
And he needs something to talk about.	Futhi udinga okuthile ukuze akhulume ngakho.
He wanted nothing there.	Wayengafuni lutho lapho.
You know why you are reading this.	Uyazi ukuthi kungani ufunda lokhu.
I can't imagine why.	Angikwazi ukucabanga ukuthi kungani.
He tried really hard.	Wazama kanzima impela.
In this, he did.	Kulokhu, wakwenza.
Now you want to make it happen.	Manje ufuna ukukwenza kwenzeke.
In prison he did not want to.	Ejele wayengafuni.
No, no and no.	Cha, cha futhi cha.
I couldn't really figure out the problem.	Angikwazanga ngempela ukuthola inkinga.
There is nothing wrong with that, he thought.	Akukho okubi kulokho, wayecabanga.
I know this will not be easy for you.	Ngiyazi ukuthi lokhu angeke kube lula kuwe.
A serious accident occurred.	Kwenzeke ingozi embi.
He is sitting in his office tonight.	Uhlala ehhovisi lakhe namhlanje ebusuku.
One has to try all the way.	Umuntu kufanele azame yonke indlela.
I have never heard anything before.	Angikaze ngizwe lutho ngaphambili.
At least nothing to do so much.	Okungenani lutho ukwenza okuningi kangaka.
But this is not the answer.	Kodwa lena akuyona impendulo.
I am very sorry about this.	Ngiyaxolisa kakhulu ngalokhu.
You only need to know.	Kudingeka ukwazi kuphela.
He thought so now.	Wacabanga kanjalo manje.
Or he thought he could.	Noma wayecabanga ukuthi angakwazi.
Not much is happening outside.	Akukho okuningi okwenzekayo ngaphandle.
Or rather he.	Noma kunalokho yena.
You should be happy about this.	Kufanele ujabule ngalokhu.
My mother too.	Umama naye.
He did not think so.	Akazange acabange ukuthi kungaba njalo.
She is the best teacher in the world.	Unguthisha ongcono kakhulu emhlabeni wonke.
He knew he was human.	Wayazi ukuthi ungumuntu.
So it is good to have him.	Ngakho kuhle ukuba naye.
Is this nothing worth it.	Ingabe lokhu akukho lutho okufanele.
Or in this case, he did not.	Noma kulokhu, akazange.
I think that's all.	Ngicabanga ukuthi konke.
You will come back here, as you always do.	Uzobuya lapha, njengoba uhlala wenza.
But that does not seem to be the case.	Kodwa kubonakala sengathi akunjalo.
Nowhere and everywhere.	Akukho ndawo futhi yonke indawo.
And it's not a very good story either.	Futhi akuyona indaba enhle kakhulu futhi.
But maybe it should.	Kodwa mhlawumbe kufanele.
They both say no.	Bobabili bathi cha.
I like to sleep.	Ngithanda ukulala.
She looks happy enough.	Ubukeka ejabule ngokwanele.
There is always tomorrow.	Kukhona njalo kusasa.
Always about that look.	Ngaso sonke isikhathi ngalokho kubukeka.
I saw my dad recently.	Ngibone ubaba muva nje.
No money right now.	Ayikho imali njengamanje.
He found out about this a few years ago.	Wathola ngalokhu eminyakeni embalwa edlule.
But first, the truth.	Kodwa okokuqala, iqiniso.
But no one else knows.	Kodwa akekho omunye owaziyo.
Getting on the bus.	Ukugibela ibhasi.
I too am not sure.	Nami anginaso isiqiniseko.
Or three weeks.	Noma amasonto amathathu.
First of all, you are never late for work.	Okokuqala nje, awukaze ufike sekwephuzile emsebenzini.
I would not do it though.	Bengingeke ngikwenze kodwa.
Moto is not required.	I-Moto akudingeki.
Dad did.	Ubaba wenza.
This time he heard.	Kulokhu wezwa.
Yes, yes he knew what he needed to do now.	Yebo, yebo wayazi ukuthi yini okwakudingeka ayenze manje.
It's hard to make a good sound.	Kunzima ukwenza umsindo omuhle.
Almost everywhere.	Cishe yonke indawo.
That is all he did.	Yilokho kuphela akwenza.
I got to the door.	Ngifike emnyango.
I have never done this.	Angikaze ngikwenze lokhu.
With this.	Ngalokhu.
It’s hard to say what happened.	Kunzima ukusho ukuthi kwenzekani.
But he always knew he was going to do it.	Kodwa wayazi ngaso sonke isikhathi ukuthi uzokwenza.
And no one immediately.	Futhi akekho ngokushesha.
Ultimately we have to do this.	Ekugcineni kufanele sikwenze lokhu.
And soon another.	Futhi ngokushesha omunye.
I need to know how it happened.	Ngidinga ukwazi ukuthi kwenzeka kanjani.
Tell me about yourself.	Ngitshele ngawe.
You don't have to say it's okay.	Akumele usho ukuthi kulungile.
I should know now.	Kufanele ngikwazi manje.
None of this happened.	Akukho kulokhu okwenzekile.
Many times every night.	Izikhathi eziningi njalo ebusuku.
I mean that in as big a way as possible.	Ngisho ukuthi ngendlela enkulu kakhulu ngangokunokwenzeka.
And he knew everything about it.	Futhi wayazi yonke into ngakho.
Or my dog.	Noma inja yami.
He says he will be back now.	Uthi uzobuya manje.
And now we know why.	Futhi manje siyazi ukuthi kungani.
I only ask for one thing from you.	Ngicela into eyodwa kuphela kuwe.
He went to the table.	Waya etafuleni.
And some will be difficult.	Futhi okunye kuzoba nzima.
It happens now as you read this.	Kwenzeka manje njengoba ufunda lokhu.
Because you are wrong and you know it.	Ngoba unephutha futhi uyakwazi.
You will need to get some clothes.	Kuzodingeka uthole ezinye izingubo.
At least we should all have it.	Okungenani sonke kufanele sibe nakho.
It is possible that the boy did not do that.	Cishe kungenzeka ukuthi umfana akazange akwenze lokho.
I think you need time.	Ngicabanga ukuthi udinga isikhathi.
Not all work but no play.	Akuwona wonke umsebenzi kodwa akukho ukudlala.
I will never know.	Angeke ngikwazi futhi.
He tried to sleep.	Wazama ukulala.
To find out.	Ukuze uthole.
That doesn't mean you can't get into trouble.	Lokho akusho ukuthi awukwazi ukungena enkingeni.
Photo alone.	Isithombe eyedwa.
Or buy a car.	Noma ukuthenga imoto.
I will not have to do it alone.	Ngeke kudingeke ngikwenze ngedwa.
Sunday morning, the same thing.	NgeSonto ekuseni, into efanayo.
Maybe we made a mistake in this.	Mhlawumbe senze iphutha kulokhu.
I mean really big money.	Ngisho imali enkulu ngempela.
It really isn't new.	Empeleni akuyona entsha.
He used to go home every night.	Wayevame ukuya ekhaya njalo ebusuku.
No matter what happens to you or what you do.	Noma ngabe kwenzekani kuwe noma wenzeni.
This may be your problem.	Lokhu kungase kube inkinga yakho.
Now with that out.	Manje ngalokho ngaphandle.
Maybe you can't speak.	Mhlawumbe awukwazi ukukhuluma.
Name.	Igama .
Very good since the time we arrived.	Kuhle kakhulu kusukela ngesikhathi sifika.
But he can't.	Kodwa angeke akwazi.
He is willing to talk.	Uzimisele ukukhuluma.
That can be either good or bad.	Lokho kungaba yinto enhle noma embi.
He took one up.	Wathatha eyodwa phezulu.
What.	Yini .
He told me he was a teacher.	Wangitshela ukuthi unguthisha.
You need to know how.	Kumele wazi ukuthi kanjani.

He is coming later.	Uyeza kamuva.
Reads a picture.	Ufunda isithombe.
I think this is possible.	Ngicabanga ukuthi lokhu kungenzeka.

No talking to the two of you.	Akukho ukukhuluma nobabili.
Very, very good.	Kakhulu, muhle kakhulu.
That’s good and good.	Lokho kuhle futhi kuhle.
Having a family.	Ukuba nomndeni.
But there is more to it than that.	Kodwa kukhona okwengeziwe kulokhu.
The spirit is not everything.	Umoya akuyona yonke into.
I wonder if he knew then.	Kazi wayazi yini ngaleso sikhathi.
He knew he couldn't stay.	Wayazi ukuthi wayengeke ahlale.
You will be there.	Uzoba lapho.
Still, it seems a lot.	Noma kunjalo, kubonakala kuningi.
He could not go.	Akakwazanga ukuya.
But that is not true at all.	Kodwa lokho akulona iqiniso nhlobo.
He had to rebuild his strength as quickly as possible.	Kwadingeka akhe kabusha amandla akhe ngokushesha ngangokunokwenzeka.

It is also true.	Kuyiqiniso futhi.

So you can't say you're the best.	Ngakho awukwazi ukusho ukuthi ungcono kakhulu.
Not really long.	Hhayi isikhathi eside ngempela.
Everyone came to me.	Wonke umuntu weza kimi.
You just did it.	Ukuthi nje ukwenzile.
He likes to do that.	Uthanda ukwenza leyo nto.
I don't really know that.	Angikwazi lokho ngempela.
He didn't know better.	Wayengazi kangcono.
It's okay if you go slow.	Kulungile uma uhamba kancane.
He would not tell anyone.	Wayengeke atshele muntu.
He went well in the end.	Wahamba kahle ekugcineni.
We know this for sure.	Siyazi ngokusobala nje.
But he thought he had done it.	Kodwa wayecabanga ukuthi ukwenzile.
Just a few hours.	Amahora ambalwa kuphela.
Not the one anyway.	Hhayi lowo noma kunjalo.
I'm not sure what to think about that.	Angazi kahle ukuthi yini okumele ngicabange ngalokho.
So this should be nothing.	Ngakho lokhu akufanele kube lutho.
He should have known better.	Bekumele azi kangcono.
I would have been very scared.	Ngabe ngesaba kakhulu.
You really think no you mean yes sometimes.	Ucabanga ngempela ukuthi cha usho yebo ngezinye izikhathi.
And that is very good to know.	Futhi lokho kuhle kakhulu ukwazi.
He might say now.	Angase asho manje.

It is not at all windy.	Akuwona neze umoya.
I will not stay here long.	Ngeke ngihlale isikhathi eside lapha.
And no one is doing anything.	Futhi akekho owenza lutho.
It is good to talk to him.	Kuhle ukukhuluma naye.
I want to know the best way to do that.	Ngifuna ukwazi indlela engcono kakhulu yokwenza lokho.
Not yet, and probably never has.	Hhayi okwamanje, futhi mhlawumbe akakaze.
This too is difficult.	Nalokhu kunzima.
It will not be as if he were going alone.	Ngeke kube sengathi uzohamba yedwa.
Whoever does that, he said.	Ubani owenza lokho, wathi.
He opened the door and opened it.	Wavula umnyango wavula.
But not here and not now.	Kodwa hhayi lapha futhi hhayi manje.
He made a lot of money.	Wenza imali eningi kakhulu.
And again, and again, and again.	Futhi futhi, futhi futhi, futhi futhi.
Today we just need to pick up the phone.	Namuhla sidinga nje ukuthatha ucingo.
Something very new for him.	Into entsha kakhulu kuye.
But he did not have to.	Kodwa kwakungadingeki enze kanjalo.
Maybe for him, that's right.	Mhlawumbe kuye, kunjalo.
But the problem is.	Kodwa inkinga.
Obviously not here.	Ngokusobala akunjalo lapha.
So stop being stupid.	Ngakho yeka ukuba isilima.
I want to know soon.	Ngifuna ukwazi ngokushesha.
Someone may come.	Omunye angase afike.
It shouldn't.	Akufanele .
It is good that it is.	Kuhle ukuthi kunjalo.
That is also true.	Lokho kuyiqiniso futhi.
You did not make a decision.	Awuzange wenze isinqumo.
You would not say why.	Ubungeke usho ukuthi kungani.
You want to know, so now you know.	Ufuna ukwazi, ngakho manje uyazi.
Doctor, very happy.	Udokotela, ejabule kakhulu.
You will not be able to leave.	Ngeke ukwazi ukuhamba.

I've always been here.	Bengilokhu ngilapha.
Not bad, really.	Akuyona embi, ngempela.
As you know now, it is not.	Njengoba wazi manje, akunjalo.
It's his, our thing.	Yinto yakhe, into yethu.
He saw a little that door.	Wabona kancane ukuthi umnyango.
Everyone was afraid of something.	Wonke umuntu wayesaba okuthile.
Someone made a mistake.	Umuntu wenza iphutha.
But the problem is vision.	Kodwa inkinga umbono.
I could not get there.	Angizange ngikwazi ukufika lapho.
So he did it in his own time.	Ngakho wakwenza ngesikhathi sakhe.
Or just one.	Noma eyodwa nje.
But not for now.	Kodwa hhayi isikhathi okwamanje.
That is not a bad thing at all !.	Akuyona into embi leyo!.
But first, the answer.	Kodwa okokuqala, impendulo.
But it's been a while, though.	Kodwa sekunesikhathi, noma kunjalo.
That we seek the truth.	Ukuthi sifuna iqiniso.
Who, why, how.	Ubani, ngani, kanjani.
You have to think for both of us.	Kufanele ucabange sobabili.
Right now, something new is happening.	Njengamanje, kwenzeka into entsha.
Very big case.	Icala elikhulu kakhulu.
I would love to learn how to do that.	Ngingathanda ukufunda indlela yokwenza lokho.
He did not think it was right.	Wayengacabangi ukuthi kufanele.
Daily pain.	Ubuhlungu nsuku zonke.
He refused to see the truth.	Wenqaba ukubona iqiniso.
And a lot of it is very good.	Futhi okuningi kuhle kakhulu.
I do not see in the middle.	Angiboni phakathi.
I thought you might like it.	Bengicabanga ukuthi ungathanda.
He just opened the door.	Wavele wavula umnyango.
You will have him too.	Uzoba naye futhi.
I can't get in like this.	Angikwazi ukungena kanje.
But what happened happened.	Kodwa okwenzekayo kwenzeka.
And you just know.	Futhi uyazi nje.
It is better that he does not know.	Kungcono ukuthi akazi.
We have to do things, but we can't.	Kufanele senze izinto, kodwa asikwazi.
She looks happy.	Ubonakala ejabule.
Or maybe he is there with his family.	Noma mhlawumbe ukhona lapho nomndeni wakhe.
He too began to walk.	Naye waqala ukuhamba.
My mother had to drive for hours.	Umama kwadingeka ashayele amahora amaningi.
So that's all right.	Ngakho konke lokho kulungile.
He always wants to get things right.	Uhlale efuna ukwenza izinto ngendlela efanele.
I think you did a very bad thing.	Ngicabanga ukuthi wenze into embi kakhulu.
Maybe it happened at this time.	Mhlawumbe kwenzeka ngalesi sikhathi.
So, yes to us.	Ngakho, yebo kithi.
I know many things.	Ngazi izinto eziningi.
This happened in the evening.	Lokhu kwenzeke kusihlwa.
He came with me.	Weza nami.
No waiting.	Akukho ukulinda.
And so good.	Futhi kuhle kanjalo.
But you have to make a decision.	Kodwa kufanele wenze isinqumo.
I once asked.	Ngike ngabuza.
I think that's just right.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kunjalo nje.
I'm glad to be helpful to you.	Ngiyajabula ukuba usizo kuwe.
Because he could not.	Ngoba akakwazanga.
He wondered what to do with the rest.	Wazibuza ukuthi enzeni ngalokho okunye.
She was well dressed.	Wayegqoke kahle.
I would like to know better.	Ngithanda ukwazi kangcono.
That would be one thing.	Lokho kungaba yinto eyodwa.
To have time.	Ukuze ube nesikhathi.
The food is very good too.	Ukudla kuhle kakhulu futhi.
If he had known that, he would have just walked out.	Ukube wakwazi lokho, ngabe wavele waphuma.
I don't know how that could be.	Angazi ukuthi kungaba kanjani lokho.
Too long, of course.	Isikhathi eside kakhulu, kunjalo.
Nothing yet, he decided.	Akukho lutho okwamanje, wanquma.
Probably someone will be there soon.	Cishe othile uzoba lapho maduze.
You don't think things through.	Awucabangi kahle izinto.
I do anything.	Ngenza noma yini.
And you will have to go much faster than you think.	Futhi kuzodingeka uhambe ngokushesha kakhulu kunalokho ocabanga ngakho.
Certainly not with all that is happening right now.	Impela akunjalo ngakho konke okwenzekayo njengamanje.
Sometimes it's hard to do.	Ngezinye izikhathi kunzima ukukwenza.
All day long he knew nothing but her.	Usuku lonke wayengazi lutho ngaphandle kwakhe.
He heard it all.	Wezwa konke.
Certainly one of yours.	Impela eyodwa yakho.
He spoke ill of her.	Wakhuluma kabi ngayo.
In the same way you did.	Ngendlela efanayo owenze ngayo.
Nothing up.	Akukho lutho phezulu.
I could not get out of this.	Angikwazanga ukuphuma kulokhu.
He knows he never really read.	Uyazi akakaze afunde ngempela.
He arrived hard this morning.	Ufike kanzima namhlanje ekuseni.
The whole family is coming.	Umndeni wonke uyeza.
I would like him to do nothing.	Ngingathanda ukuthi ayenze lutho.
Fast, fast, fast.	Ngokushesha, ngokushesha, ngokushesha.
Everyone was amazed.	Wonke umuntu wamangala kakhulu.
He wants the boy to have that.	Ufuna umfana abe nakho lokho.
But he found that he could not speak.	Kodwa wathola ukuthi akakwazi ukukhuluma.
As you are wrong about many other things.	Njengoba unephutha ngezinye izinto eziningi.
It will not happen though.	Ngeke kwenzeke kodwa.
I can't wait for this one.	Angikwazi ukulinda lena.
But that is the case for now.	Kodwa kunjalo okwamanje.
There you are.	Ukhona wena.
The question here, too, is why.	Umbuzo lapha, futhi, kungani.
He is, all right.	Nguye, kulungile.
It's very difficult, but it's okay.	Kunzima kakhulu, kodwa kulungile.
Up here.	Phezulu lapha.
He had to do that regularly.	Kwakudingeka akwenze njalo lokho.
Everyone can and should.	Wonke umuntu angakwazi futhi kufanele futhi kufanele.
I need my pain.	Ngidinga ubuhlungu bami.
I thought that was not a good idea.	Bengicabanga ukuthi akuwona umqondo omuhle lowo.
Yes, a mistake.	Yebo, iphutha.
He goes the way.	Uhamba ngendlela.
And, well.	Futhi, kuhle.
There is music of course.	Kukhona umculo Yebo.
Doing the right thing is difficult.	Ukwenza into enhle ngayo kunzima.
You can't tell anyone.	Awukwazi ukutshela muntu.
It should be a lot easier than that.	Kufanele kube lula kakhulu kunalokho.
Alone.	Wedwa.
What happened, happened.	Okwenzekile, kwenzeka.
I would, he thought.	Ngingathanda, wacabanga.
I don’t think today, thank you.	Angicabangi namuhla, ngiyabonga.
You will have to leave.	Kuzodingeka ukuhamba.
Here, at least.	Lapha, okungenani.
He wanted it to happen.	Wayefuna kwenzeke.
You will not go anywhere.	Ngeke uye ndawo.
I wish to fix this.	Ngifisa ukulungisa lokhu.
A child.	Ingane .
My mother knows.	Umama wami uyazi.
I can get into trouble if I have to.	Ngingakwazi ukungena enkingeni uma kudingeka.
I don't remember very well, anything.	Angisakhumbuli kahle, noma yini.
At the moment he wants nothing.	Okwamanje akafuni lutho.
Not so at that time.	Akunjalo ngaleso sikhathi.
Except maybe not so much.	Ngaphandle mhlawumbe hhayi kakhulu.
Three powers.	Amandla amathathu.
I thought you would like to go with me.	Bengicabanga ukuthi ungathanda ukuhamba nami.
That was me.	Kube yimina lowo.
He certainly said yes.	Impela wathi yebo.
That is why he has come.	Yingakho eze.
He did, but not for long.	Wakwenza, kodwa hhayi isikhathi eside.
He did more.	Wenza okwengeziwe.
At that moment, he took his own life.	Ngaleso sikhathi, wathatha ukuphila kwakhe.
But he thought of her more.	Kodwa wayecabanga ngaye kakhulu.
But this is good news.	Kodwa indaba enhle le.
A little at a time.	Kancane ngesikhathi.
I'm glad we did.	Ngiyajabula ngokuthi senze kanjalo.
Everyone can be better.	Wonke umuntu angaba ngcono.
Still, he agreed.	Noma kunjalo, wavuma.
I wish this had happened years ago.	Ngifisa sengathi ngabe lokhu kwenzeke eminyakeni edlule.
Nothing else needed to be done.	Akukho okunye okwakudingeka kwenziwe.
So, at first.	Ngakho, ekuqaleni.
But it was not necessary, at first.	Kodwa kwakungadingeki, ekuqaleni.
He can't do this.	Akakwazi ukwenza lokhu.
I'm trying to learn about you.	Ngizama ukufunda ngani.
Something big happened.	Kwenzeke into enkulu.
I am very happy to be with him there.	Ngijabule kakhulu ukungena naye lapho.
He did not want to talk to her at all.	Wayengafuni nhlobo ukukhuluma naye.
He has never seen anyone so beautiful.	Akakaze abone umuntu omuhle kangaka.
He wants to do it alone.	Ufuna ukukwenza yedwa.
He told me all about it.	Ungitshele konke ngakho.
It would be good to try.	Kungaba kuhle ukuzama.
But it can be very difficult.	Kodwa kungase kube nzima kakhulu.
That is not a problem.	Lokho akuyona inkinga.
That is not the time.	Lokho akusona isikhathi.
I'm talking about other things.	Ngikhuluma ngezinye izinto.
What do you think it is right now.	Ucabanga ukuthi yini okwamanje.
I'm happy for her too.	Nami ngijabule ngaye.
Or at least he was optimistic.	Noma okungenani wayenethemba.
Nothing too big.	Akukho okukhulu kakhulu.
So he had to leave.	Ngakho kwadingeka ahambe.
This looks really like me.	Lokhu kubukeka njengami ngempela.
It has to be about him.	Kufanele kube ngaye.
He just spoke and spoke.	Wakhuluma nje wakhuluma.
all day.	usuku lonke.
But it is better my picture this way.	Kodwa kungcono isithombe sami ngale ndlela.
Better yet.	Kungcono kube kuhle.
But today it is true.	Kodwa namuhla kuyiqiniso.
You can, however.	Ungakwazi, noma kunjalo.
That is why it all happened.	Yingakho konke kwenzeka.
But only me.	Kodwa mina kuphela.
That’s something, isn’t it ?.	Yilokho okuthile, akunjalo?.
He decided to do just that.	Wanquma ukwenza kanjalo.
Because the answer is no.	Ngoba impendulo ayikho.
But you have to say my name.	Kodwa kufanele usho igama lami.
He could not get there.	Akakwazanga ukufika lapho.
I don't want to work.	Angifuni ukusebenza.
No, actually.	Cha, empeleni.
Well, not really people, really.	Hhayi, hhayi abantu impela, impela.
His mind refused to go there.	Umqondo wakhe wenqaba ukuya lapho.
You want to leave immediately.	Ufuna ukuhamba ngokushesha.
Yes, it is true, yes.	Yebo, kuyiqiniso, yebo.
I want to finish my job in the right way.	Ngifuna ukuqeda umsebenzi wami ngendlela efanele.
At least, not together.	Okungenani, hhayi ndawonye.
This is not all new.	Lokhu akuyona yonke into entsha.
Obviously it will be hard to read.	Ngokusobala kuzoba nzima ukufunda.
It had to be human.	Kwakufanele kube umuntu.
For now at least.	Okwamanje okungenani.
Maybe a little too much, sometimes.	Mhlawumbe kancane kakhulu, ngezinye izikhathi.
Everyone better go.	Wonke umuntu kungcono ahambe.
More there.	Okuningi lapho.
I thought about that for a long time.	Ngangicabanga lokho ngempela isikhathi eside.
And maybe you just need a job.	Futhi mhlawumbe udinga umsebenzi nje.
He should not do it.	Akufanele akwenze.
He wishes to return home.	Ufisa ukubuyela ekhaya.
It should never have happened.	Kwakungafanele neze kwenzeke.
Nothing so good so far.	Ayikho into enhle kakhulu kuze kube manje.
Not a child.	Hhayi ingane.
What happened to me.	Kwenzekani kimi.
I wanted to know everything.	Ngangifuna ukwazi konke.
Large window.	Iwindi elikhulu.
And not just his house.	Futhi hhayi nje indlu yakhe.

She is more beautiful than you.	Muhle kunawe.
He can drive again.	Angaphinde ashayele.

All sound.	Wonke umsindo.
This is actually very good !.	Lokhu empeleni kuhle kakhulu!.
Sleep, for now.	Ukulala, okwamanje.

But, not in this case.	Kodwa, hhayi kulokhu.
He knew everything now.	Wayazi yonke into manje.
You have to stay with you.	Kufanele uhlale nawe.

You need to eat well.	Udinga ukudla kahle.
But he was not sure he could.	Kodwa wayengenaso isiqiniseko sokuthi angakwazi.
So nothing at all.	Ngakho akukho nhlobo.
I could not see in the middle.	Bengingeke ngikwazi ukubona phakathi.
That he used to play tennis with her.	Ukuthi wayevame ukudlala ithenisi naye.
But it is not wind.	Kodwa akuwona umoya.
And the advice did not do that.	Futhi iseluleko asizange senze kanjalo.
About three hours.	Cishe amahora amathathu.
But I think there is a problem.	Kodwa ngicabanga ukuthi kukhona inkinga.
But there is so much more here.	Kodwa kuningi kakhulu lapha.
So does he, too.	Kanjalo naye, naye.
He was not home enough.	Wayengekho ekhaya ngokwanele.
Does anyone know why? 	Ukhona owaziyo ukuthi kungani?
I can do it quickly on my own.	Ngingakwenza ngokushesha ngedwa.
It's hard to stay here.	Kunzima ukuhlala lapha.
But you probably will not.	Kodwa cishe ngeke ukwazi.
You are probably very happy.	Mhlawumbe ujabule kakhulu.
I was looking for a date.	Bengifuna usuku.
I hope you feel better.	Ngethemba ukuthi uzizwa engcono.
Not again.	Akukho futhi.
He never said anything here.	Akakaze akhulume lutho lapha.
He told me that many times.	Wangitshela lokho izikhathi eziningi.
There is noise.	Kukhona umsindo.
I would never do such a bad thing.	Angisoze ngenze into embi kangaka.
I did not hear his question.	Angizange ngizwe umbuzo wakhe.
I do not know where.	Angazi kuphi.
Maybe he doesn't want to.	Mhlawumbe akafuni.
All of this had to be good.	Konke lokhu kwakufanele kube kuhle.
You can't live with it.	Awukwazi ukuphila ngakho.
It could be hours.	Kungenzeka kube amahora.
This is not the father.	Akuyena ubaba lo.

You have done very well and still.	Wenze kahle kakhulu futhi namanje.
And you need to stay there.	Futhi udinga ukuhlala lapho.

I have waited too long.	Ngilinde isikhathi eside kakhulu.
Or a little later.	Noma kamuva kancane.
He did not look for anyone but himself.	Akazange afune muntu ngaphandle kwakhe.
Something or other.	Okuthile noma okunye.
Let's go a little further.	Ake sihambe kancane.
And he obviously wanted something.	Futhi ngokusobala wayefuna okuthile.
He sits at the top of the station.	Uhlala phezulu esiteshini.
You should have done so.	Bekufanele wenze njalo.

But, of course, it is not really so.	Kodwa, kunjalo, akunjalo ngempela.
But he thought he would probably do well.	Kodwa wayecabanga ukuthi cishe uzokwenza kahle.
I never talked about him to her.	Angikaze ngikhulume ngaye kuye.
I'm sure it isn't.	Ngiqinisekile ukuthi akunjalo.
The answer is not here and it is not.	Impendulo ayikho lapha futhi ayikho.
Money does not exist.	Imali ayikho.
You need to find out what's going on.	Udinga ukuthola ukuthi kwenzekani.

It would be nice thank you.	Kungaba kuhle ngiyabonga.
That's not the guy looking for the truth.	Akuyena umfana ofuna iqiniso lowo.
He asked for help.	Wacela ukusiza.
He does not like to go.	Akathandi ukuhamba.
You did not become my friend.	Awuzange ube umngane wami.
And he did it the same way.	Futhi wakwenza ngendlela efanayo.
This should be a really good thing.	Lokhu kufanele kube yinto enhle ngempela.

He says he just needs more time.	Uthi nje udinga isikhathi esiningi.
Yes, that sounds good.	Yebo, lokho kuzwakala kulungile.

See me there, hear that.	Ngibone lapho, ngizwe lokho.
There’s not much there, of course.	Akukho okuningi lapho, kusobala.
I tried to tell the police that.	Ngazama ukutshela amaphoyisa lokho.
He wouldn't do that to her, not now.	Wayengeke akwenze lokho kuye, hhayi manje.
But he cannot do it alone.	Kodwa akakwazi ukukwenza yedwa.
My father could do nothing.	Ubaba akakwazanga ukwenza lutho.
It may be better than you think.	Kungase kube ngcono kunalokho ocabanga ngakho.
Not just speculation.	Hhayi nje ukucabanga.
You will go with me tomorrow.	Uzohamba nami kusasa.
I just couldn’t stay with that.	Angikwazanga nje ukuhlala nalokho.
There will be plenty of time to do other things.	Kuzoba nesikhathi esiningi sokwenza ezinye izinto.
The sound works perfectly.	Umsindo usebenza ngokuphelele.
Money for convenience.	Imali ukuze kube lula.
But he did not know where it was.	Kodwa wayengazi ukuthi kuphi.
He does not know how to settle down.	Akazi ukuthi uzohlala kanjani endaweni.
I have to find a new job.	Kufanele ngithole umsebenzi omusha.
He found that he could not do it.	Wathola ukuthi wayengeke akwazi ukukwenza.
And thank you very much.	Futhi ngiyabonga kakhulu.
He can make a lot of money.	Angenza imali eningi.
Not this soon.	Hhayi lokhu maduze.

And it could be anyone.	Futhi kungase kube noma ubani.
Now we can't go back there.	Manje asikwazi ukubuyela lapho.

This is no small problem.	Lena akuyona inkinga encane.
Great cry.	Ukukhala okukhulu.
Even if it sounds like it.	Noma ngabe kuzwakala kunjalo.

I came close last night.	Ngize eduze izolo ebusuku.
You think you did.	Ucabanga ukuthi ukwenzile.

It soon became clear why.	Ngokushesha kwacaca ukuthi kungani.
Yes, but it's okay.	Yebo, kodwa kulungile.
Something could happen to him.	Kungenzeka okuthile kuye.

Everyone works very hard.	Wonke umuntu usebenza kanzima kakhulu.
And not just a little, but very much.	Futhi hhayi nje kancane, kodwa impela kakhulu.
Good a few times.	Kuhle izikhathi ezimbalwa.
How can that be.	Kungenzeka kanjani lokho.
He was very surprised that it did not happen.	Wamangala kakhulu ukuthi akuzange kwenzeke.
That should be good enough.	Lokho kufanele kube kuhle ngokwanele.
I did not want to get in there.	Ngangingafuni ukungena lapho.
But maybe not now.	Kodwa mhlawumbe hhayi manje.
He didn't, actually.	Akazange, empeleni.
I did it all.	Ngenze konke.
This is happening '.	Kwenzeka lokhu'.

But first, he had to do one thing.	Kodwa okokuqala, kwakudingeka enze into eyodwa.
In this case, you have found a good place.	Kulokhu, uthole indawo enhle.

In the morning he does not want anyone near him.	Ekuseni akafuni muntu eduze kwakhe.
Not that someone else did.	Hhayi ukuthi omunye wenza.
But he never did that.	Kodwa akakaze enze kanje.
You say one thing and do another.	Usho into eyodwa wenze enye.
You can't do much, you can't buy much.	Awukwazi ukwenza okuningi, awukwazi ukuthenga okuningi.
I can’t do without him anyway.	Angikwazi ukwenza ngaphandle kwakhe noma kanjani.
I think a lot about this.	Ngicabanga kakhulu ngalokhu.
Nothing great, just a few days.	Akukho okukhulu, izinsuku ezimbalwa nje.
We need to find another place.	Sidinga ukuthola enye indawo.
I feel very happy about that.	Ngizizwa ngijabule kakhulu ngalokho.
The biggest problem, you know.	Inkinga enkulu kakhulu, uyazi.
That would be a really bad thing.	Lokho kungaba yinto embi ngempela.
She never considered getting married.	Akakaze acabange ukushada.
I think of you all the time.	Ngicabanga ngawe njalo.
I do not believe much.	Angikholwa kakhulu.
Not a few years.	Hhayi iminyaka embalwa.
But there is no money.	Kodwa ayikho imali.

It is very difficult for me.	Kunzima kakhulu kimi.
In this case, a long time.	Kulokhu, isikhathi eside.
This person just would not do that.	Lo muntu ubengeke nje akwenze lokho.
But this is not a job.	Kodwa lokhu akuwona umsebenzi.
He really tried.	Wazama ngempela.
His mother sat in front.	Umama wakhe wahlala ngaphambili.
Not three days.	Hhayi izinsuku ezintathu.
Is it really.	Ingabe ngempela .
I have no place.	Anginayo indawo.
And you did it alone.	Futhi ukwenze wedwa.
It could be just living your life.	Kungaba ukuphila impilo yakho nje.

Same thing at work.	Into efanayo emsebenzini.
He said he wanted more.	Wathi ufuna okunye okwengeziwe.
The problem is not the system.	Inkinga akulona uhlelo.
You can't go anywhere.	Awukwazi ukuya ndawo.
You are my man.	Ungumuntu wami.
It just sounds like that.	Kuzwakala kanjalo nje .
He seems to be doing much better.	Ubonakala enza kangcono kakhulu.
A few weeks, maybe.	Amasonto ambalwa, mhlawumbe.
He never told me his name.	Akazange angitshele igama lakhe.
He needs to stop drinking.	Kudingeka ayeke ukuphuza.

Everything, everything at a time.	Konke, konke ngesikhathi.
And so it happened.	Futhi ngakho kwenzeka.

I know about you.	Ngiyazi ngawe.
He works hard everywhere.	Usebenza kanzima yonke indawo.
You ate very little over the weekend.	Udle kancane kakhulu ngempelasonto.
It had to be a boy, he thought.	Kwakufanele kube umfana, wacabanga.
He wanted to be alone for a long time.	Wayefuna ukuba yedwa isikhathi eside.
That is not true at all.	Lokho akulona iqiniso nhlobo.

Unless anyone else.	Ngaphandle uma kukhona omunye.

So now everyone thinks he can do it, too.	Ngakho manje wonke umuntu ucabanga ukuthi angakwenza, futhi.
Thinking about it now.	Ukucabanga ngakho manje.
At that time.	Ngaleso sikhathi .

It may not be necessary.	Kungase kungadingeki.
Right now, this time.	Njengamanje, lesi sikhathi.
I knew nothing about this until now.	Bengingazi lutho kulokhu kuze kube manje.
Home all morning.	Ekhaya ekuseni yonke.
None of us want to be here.	Akekho kithi ofuna ukuba lapha.
We have to go.	Kumele sihambe.
Slowly, but still.	Kancane, kodwa noma kunjalo.
There he sat, at the table.	Lapho wahlala, etafuleni.

Everyone knew why.	Wonke umuntu wayazi ukuthi kungani.
And great.	Futhi enkulu.
He has been with me all day long.	Ube nami usuku lonke.

Yes, just one.	Yebo, eyodwa nje.
So the question.	Ngakho umbuzo.
This will not be the case.	Lokhu ngeke kube njalo.
Let me see the book.	Ake ngibone incwadi.
But please come quickly.	Kodwa ngicela ufike ngokushesha.
And it is possible that.	Futhi kungenzeka ukuthi.

And maybe this is true today.	Futhi mhlawumbe lokhu kuyiqiniso namuhla.
But yes, this is good.	Kodwa yebo, lokhu kuhle.
Please make a mistake.	Ngicela ngenze iphutha.
No, you know that.	Cha, uyakwazi lokho.
I was thinking about sleeping.	Bengicabanga ukulala.

I'll have to talk to him about it.	Kuzofanele ngikhulume naye ngakho.
Looks like, well.	Kubukeka sengathi, kahle.
There is nothing wrong with this.	Akukho lutho ngale ndaba.
So he had to try again.	Ngakho kwadingeka azame futhi.
We want to be there.	Sifuna ukuba lapho.
Everyone knew about him.	Wonke umuntu wayazi ngaye.
And it's me.	Futhi yimina.
Almost all of that.	Cishe konke lokho.
He could not think at all.	Ubengeke akwazi nhlobo ukucabanga.
Once a week for a while.	Kanye ngesonto isikhashana.
He was.	Waba .
But as you like.	Kodwa njengoba uthanda.
Tom is not at all.	UTom akayena neze.
I know everyone is here.	Ngiyazi ukuthi wonke umuntu ukhona lapha.
I know you do not really want to do that.	Ngiyazi ukuthi awufuni ngempela ukwenza lokho.
Sounds great.	Kuzwakala kuhle kakhulu.
He said he had to leave.	Wathi kumele ahambe.
Or just knowing.	Noma ukwazi nje.

He does things the right way.	Wenza izinto ngendlela efanele.
How do you feel about it ?.	Uzizwa kanjani ngakho?.
I did not want anyone to know.	Ngangingafuni muntu azi.
It should not have happened here.	Akufanele ngabe kwenzeka lapha.

And it was definitely worth the wait.	Futhi bekufanele nakanjani ukulinda.
In fact, it should not be so.	Empeleni, akumele kube njalo.
Coming here.	Ukuza lapha.
He felt his clothes.	Wezwa izingubo zakhe.
I'm always scared.	Ngesaba njalo.
And that is what happened later.	Futhi yilokho okwenzeka kamuva.
Next week there is none.	Ngesonto elizayo akukho nhlobo.
Sometimes you will, sometimes you will not.	Ngezinye izikhathi uzokwenza, ngezinye izikhathi ngeke ukwenze.
Yes, I'm sorry about that.	Yebo, ngiyaxolisa ngalokho.
Yes, all the money.	Yebo, yonke imali.

Because you can't know.	Ngoba awukwazi ukwazi.
It's good to eat that '.	Kuhle ukudla lokho'.
This is nothing new, of course.	Lokhu akuyona into entsha, yebo.
We all need to be together in this.	Sonke sidinga ukuba ndawonye kulokhu.
That is not necessary at all.	Lokho akudingekile nakancane.
He is always just sitting.	Ngaso sonke isikhathi uhlezi nje.
It's hard to say.	Kunzima ukuthi ngisho.
Here, he knew he would be talking to himself.	Lapha, wayazi ukuthi uzobe ekhuluma yedwa.
And he never did.	Futhi akakaze.
Or at least you want to.	Noma okungenani ufuna.
And what is missing.	Futhi yini engekho.
He looked everywhere.	Wabheka yonke indawo.
I'll go if you like.	Ngizohamba uma uthanda.
And stop today.	Futhi yeka namuhla.
I want a big team.	Ngifuna iqembu elikhulu.
Please do not do it.	Ngicela ungakwenzi.
He did not return.	Akazange abuye.
He did something.	Wenza okuthile.
Not really a lie.	Hhayi amanga impela.
But he has never been with us.	Kodwa akakaze ahlale nathi.
He did not say or do anything.	Akazange asho lutho noma enze lutho.
I knew then.	Ngazi ngaleso sikhathi.
But this should not be the case.	Kodwa lokhu akufanele kube.
But, you have to eat.	Kodwa, kufanele udle.
You need to cry.	Udinga ukukhala.
I thought at home.	Ngacabanga ekhaya.
He does not want to leave home.	Akafuni ukuhamba ekhaya.
If you wish.	Uma ufisa.
So tell me.	Ngakho ungitshele .
And there is pain.	Futhi kukhona ubuhlungu.
And that is not a good thing at all.	Futhi lokho akuyona into enhle ngempela.
This is a permit.	Lena imvume.
Or this.	Noma lokhu.
I don’t really know what else I should do.	Angazi ngempela ukuthi yini enye okufanele ngiyenze.
You always think you are doing the right thing.	Uhlale ucabanga ukuthi wenza okufanele.
There is something here.	Kukhona into lapha.
I wanted to tell someone about this.	Bengifuna ukutshela othile ngalokhu.

She is scared to death today.	Uyesaba ukufa namuhla.
It always happens there.	Kwenzeka ngaso sonke isikhathi lapho.
Whatever happened yesterday.	Noma ngabe kwenzekeni izolo.
All right, he says.	Kulungile, usho kanje.
He didn't want to play with her.	Wayengafuni ukudlala naye.
I thought she was very beautiful.	Bengicabanga ukuthi muhle kakhulu.
One for now.	Eyodwa okwamanje.
I never thought about him.	Angikaze ngicabange ngaye.
Not yet, and probably not always.	Hhayi okwamanje, futhi mhlawumbe hhayi njalo.
Yes, you should eat.	Yebo, kufanele udle.
He says he may do his homework.	Uthi angase enze umsebenzi wakhe wesikole.
And you want to do just that.	Futhi ufuna ukwenza lokho kanye.
Or next weekend.	Noma ngempelasonto ezayo.
He wouldn't do that to her.	Ubengeke akwenze lokho kuye.
And, yes, a lot is happening to you.	Futhi, yebo, kuningi okwenzekayo kuwe.
If there are people outside.	Uma kukhona abantu ngaphandle.
And that can be a problem.	Futhi lokho kungaba inkinga.
Glad to hear that is possible.	Ngiyajabula ukuzwa ukuthi kungenzeka.
Later, he proposed marriage, and she accepted.	Kamuva, wacela umshado, wavuma.
What are you doing there.	Wenzani lapho .
It is true and it is not true.	Kuyiqiniso futhi akulona iqiniso.
This is also possible.	Lokhu futhi kungenzeka.
My mother seems to be asleep.	Umama ngathi ulele.
And he got permission very quickly.	Futhi wathola imvume ngokushesha okukhulu.
There must be something about him.	Kumelwe ukuba kukhona okuthile ngaye .
At first, he was too scared to do so.	Ekuqaleni, wayesaba kakhulu ukukwenza.
He knows everything about me.	Wazi konke ngami.
Your house, he says.	Indlu yakho, usho.
He will do it later.	Uzokwenza kamuva.
And as long as possible.	Futhi isikhathi eside ngangokunokwenzeka.
I just wonder about that.	Ngiyazibuza nje ngalokho.
Just a house.	Indlu nje.
That's just fine.	Kuhle lokho nje.
He wanted to go everywhere.	Wayefuna ukuhamba yonke indawo.
But you made a choice.	Kodwa wenze ukukhetha.
He doesn't know what to do about it.	Akazi ukuthi enzeni ngalokho.
Now, it's better.	Manje, kungcono.
Staying at home.	Ukuhlala ekhaya.
You want to buy.	Ufuna ukuthenga.
Hope is not a party.	Ithemba akulona iqembu.
Very good decision.	Isinqumo esihle kakhulu.
But, more on that later.	Kodwa, okuningi ngalokho kamuva.
You can too.	Ungakwazi futhi.
He went to prison.	Waya ejele.

That is not your problem.	Akuyona inkinga yakho leyo.
You may have to find a new one.	Kungase kudingeke ukuthi uthole entsha.

Later, he could not speak at all.	Kamuva, akakwazanga nhlobo ukukhuluma.
You will have it.	Uzoba nakho.
I just wanted to go.	Ngangifuna ukuhamba kuphela.
There is just a case.	Kukhona icala nje.
He refuses to join us.	Wenqaba nathi.
Obviously that did not happen.	Ngokusobala lokho akuzange kwenzeke.
He looks like a good boy.	Ubonakala ungumfana omuhle.
Being his friend, and everything.	Ukuba umngane wakhe, nakho konke.
I wonder what it could be.	Kazi kungaba yini.
Maybe not coffee.	Mhlawumbe hhayi ikhofi.

You will not do that here.	Ngeke ukwenze lokho lapha.
He probably could not finish one.	Cishe akazange akwazi ukuqeda eyodwa.
I hope so for you.	Ngethemba kanjalo ngenxa yakho.
So far, hopefully.	Kuze kube manje, ngethemba.
Maybe something else.	Mhlawumbe kukhona okunye.
Or music or work.	Noma umculo noma umsebenzi.
I don’t think every day about that yet.	Angicabangi nsuku zonke ngalokho okwamanje.
I will do whatever you want me to do.	Ngizokwenza noma yini ofuna ngiyenze.
But that's it.	Kodwa yilokho.
He must be with us.	Kufanele abe nathi.
You know what happens when you think.	Uyazi ukuthi kwenzekani uma ucabanga.
I got it all.	Ngithole konke.
Or not so much.	Noma hhayi kakhulu.
Let me say it this way.	Ake ngisho kanje.
I don't think that will happen easily in my age.	Angicabangi ukuthi lokho kuzokwenzeka kalula eminyakeni yami.
And there is another problem.	Futhi kukhona enye inkinga.
You do not need to go to school.	Awudingi ukufunda esikoleni.
It is available every year.	Kukhona njalo ngonyaka.
You will need to do that again soon.	Kuzodingeka ukwenze lokho futhi maduze nje.
You should be able to do this.	Kufanele ukwazi ukwenza lokhu.
He never did such a thing.	Akazange enze into enjalo.
I want someone.	Ngifuna umuntu.
But something might be wrong.	Kodwa kungenzeka ukuthi kukhona okuthile.
Let us help one another.	Asisize sodwa.
And there is another idea.	Futhi kukhona omunye umbono.
You never said anything to me.	Awukaze usho lutho kimi.
I think he lives with his family.	Ngicabanga ukuthi uhlala nomndeni wakhe.
I know that's not true.	Ngiyazi ukuthi lokho akulona iqiniso.
But it happened slowly.	Kodwa kwenzeka kancane kancane.
It is very difficult to do it the right way.	Kunzima kakhulu ukukwenza ngendlela efanele.
But he was nowhere to be seen.	Kodwa wayengabonakali ndawo.
He had to work hard.	Bekufanele akwenze kanzima.
So far, so good.	Kuze kube manje, ube ngcono ngakho.
I should have known.	Bekufanele ngikwazi.
Everyone loves something new.	Wonke umuntu uthanda into entsha.
Very good to read.	Kuhle kakhulu ukufunda.
This would be a huge undertaking, to say the least.	Lokhu kungaba umsebenzi omkhulu, ukusho okungenani.
I want to stay with him.	Ngifuna ukuhlala naye.
But it is not just my time.	Kodwa akusona isikhathi sami kuphela.
Not a boy.	Hhayi umfana.
Yes and yes and yes.	Yebo futhi yebo futhi yebo.
A few other things, not much.	Ezinye izinto ezimbalwa, hhayi okuningi.
The only book that stays on my desk.	Incwadi kuphela ehlala etafuleni lami.
Yes, you can, because you did.	Yebo, ungakwenza, ngoba ukwenzile.
He probably knew he wouldn't be.	Kungenzeka ukuthi wayazi ukuthi wayengeke abe.
He seems to be doing just that.	Ubonakala enza lokho kanye.
Every later.	Njalo kamuva.
But that is not a bad thing at all.	Kodwa akuyona into embi kakhulu leyo.
He tried the key.	Wazama ukhiye.
I only want my new one.	Ngifuna entsha yami kuphela.
That's exactly right.	Impela kunjalo .
And that is good and right.	Futhi lokho kuhle futhi kulungile.
He just heard.	Wavele wezwa.
You will not be able to sleep well at night.	Ngeke ukwazi ukulala kahle ebusuku.
No one should know that he is not a father.	Akekho okufanele azi ukuthi akayena ubaba.
He stayed that way for years.	Wahlala kanjalo iminyaka.
Maybe you got some air.	Mhlawumbe uthole umoya.
It's all my fault.	Iphutha lami lonke.
And maybe more thinking.	Futhi mhlawumbe ukucabanga okwengeziwe.
You can't live like that.	Awukwazi ukuphila kanjalo.
My whole family goes here.	Umndeni wami wonke uya lapha.
I didn't know what to do with it all.	Ngangingazi ukuthi ngenzeni ngakho konke.
He eventually retired and returned home.	Ekugcineni wathatha umhlalaphansi wabuyela ekhaya.
I wanted nothing to do with it.	Ngangingafuni lutho ngakho.
Now he could not control himself.	Manje akakwazanga ukuzibamba.
This can be very difficult at a party.	Lokhu kungase kube nzima kakhulu ephathini.
She is trying to stop.	Uzama ukuyeka.
That is why it happened.	Yingakho kwenzeka.
I could not get out of him.	Angikwazanga ukuphuma kuye.
It seems to be true.	Kubonakala kuyiqiniso.
No, my mother thought so.	Cha, umama wacabanga kanjalo.
He thought about that many times.	Wacabanga ngalokho izikhathi eziningi.
But if you don't, it's not a big deal.	Kodwa uma ungakwenzi, akuyona into enkulu.
I want you to be happy for as long as possible.	Ngifuna ujabule isikhathi eside ngangokunokwenzeka.
But you do not have to do that.	Kodwa awudingi ukwenza lokho.
It's done by a lot of people.	Kwenziwe abantu abaningi.
Just walking, or.	Ukuhamba nje, noma.
Because this is my home.	Ngoba umuzi wami lo.
In this case, no one knows.	Kulokhu, akekho umuntu owaziyo.
You know how it sounds.	Uyazi ukuthi kuzwakala kanjani.
So he could not see.	Ngakho akakwazanga ukubona.
We just do our thing.	Senza into yethu nje.
At that time probably.	Ngaleso sikhathi cishe.
But your baby is safe.	Kodwa ingane yakho ayikho engozini.
I'm not sure about that now.	Angiqiniseki ngalokho manje.
And it may.	Futhi kungase.
He saw his life for years to come.	Wabona ukuphila kwakhe iminyaka ezayo.
Maybe food.	Mhlawumbe ukudla.
Very few.	Ambalwa kakhulu.
At first, that's right.	Ekuqaleni, kunjalo.
But it will be soon.	Kodwa uzoba maduze.
Really down to earth.	Ngempela phansi emhlabeni.
And he is very talented.	Futhi unekhono kakhulu.
I want to know about him.	Ngifuna ukwazi ngaye.
So it seems yes.	Ngakho kubonakala yebo.
All by myself.	Konke ngedwa.
Trying to fix something.	Ukuzama ukulungisa okuthile.
Or your spirit.	Noma umoya wakho.
I know it's not, it's not.	Ngiyazi ukuthi akunjalo, akunjalo.
This is very likely.	Lokhu kungenzeka kakhulu.
He wanted to know everything about me.	Wayefuna ukwazi konke ngami.
He knew he had to win.	Wayazi ukuthi kufanele awine.
You should at least know what is going on.	Kufanele okungenani wazi ukuthi kwenzekani.
But he knew he had to do better than that.	Kodwa wayazi ukuthi kufanele enze kangcono kunalokho.
It's really hard to see how.	Kunzima ngempela ukubona ukuthi kanjani.
Later it is better.	Kamuva kungcono.
I did not want to get in.	Ngangingafuni ukungena.
This is your house.	Indlu yakho lena.
He did it, almost every day.	Wakwenza, cishe zonke izinsuku.
That is why he wants to talk to you.	Yingakho efuna ukukhuluma nawe.
He came to her.	Weza kuye.
He knew that he would not stay long there.	Wayazi ukuthi wayengeke ahlale isikhathi eside lapho.
And here at least we know he is coming.	Futhi lapha okungenani siyazi ukuthi uyeza.
Even just a little.	Ngisho encane nje.
Taking his time.	Ukuthatha isikhathi sakhe.
Getting everything.	Ukuthola konke.
Only way, only way.	Indlela kuphela, indlela kuphela.
That's fine, too.	Kuhle lokho, futhi.
He's busy, you know.	Umatasa, uyazi.
He talks about that.	Ukhuluma ngalokho.
He thought he was wasting time.	Wayecabanga ukuthi udlala isikhathi.
I see you should know.	Ngibone kufanele wazi.
Okay, so far very good.	Kulungile, kuze kube manje kuhle kakhulu.
I had to stay home all day.	Kwadingeka ngihlale ekhaya usuku lonke.
Some of you have to be like that.	Okunye kwakho kufanele kube njalo.
I could not say or do anything to fix it.	Angikwazanga ukusho noma ukwenza noma yini ukulungisa.
This should happen to you.	Lokhu kufanele kwenzeke kuwe.
But he knew that was not the case.	Kodwa wayazi ukuthi akunjalo.
This happened very quickly.	Lokhu kwenzeka ngokushesha.
It's true, really.	Kuyiqiniso, ngempela.
It should not be too hard to find.	Akufanele abe nzima kakhulu ukuthola.
I don't think you should.	Ngicabanga ukuthi akufanele.
It's hard to say again.	Kunzima ukusho futhi.
That's your new idea.	Lowo umbono wakho omusha.
He says this is the case.	Uthi lokhu kunjalo.
If only a few days.	Uma nje izinsuku ezimbalwa.
You know him.	Uyazi yena.
He was not sure he could do this.	Wayengenaso isiqiniseko sokuthi angakwenza lokhu.
Certainly not.	Impela ubungeke.
He decided to stay another week.	Wabona ukuthi uzohlala elinye isonto.
There is just something else.	Kukhona nje enye into.
I'm sure there is one.	Ngiqinisekile kukhona eyodwa.
Doing so would be a waste of time.	Ukwenza kanjalo kungaba ukuchitha isikhathi.
You are currently trying to access many items.	Okwamanje uzama ukuthola izinto eziningi.
Okay, one more.	Kulungile, okunye futhi.
I wouldn't do it now.	bengingeke ngikwenze manje.
That he was not at all.	Ukuthi wayengeyena neze.
The fact that he did.	Iqiniso ukuthi wakwenza.
For now, he wanted nothing more.	Okwamanje, wayengafuni lutho.
Or his mother.	Noma umama wakhe.
He said he would win.	Uthe uzowina.
Nothing just happens.	Akukho okwenzekayo nje.
I don't like to wait.	Angithandi ukulinda.
I think we should do this now.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kufanele sikwenze lokhu manje.
And in that.	Futhi kulokho.
I thought it looked bad.	Bengicabanga ukuthi kubukeka kabi.
I must not go.	Akumele ngihambe.
I will be with you all the time.	Ngizoba nawe sonke isikhathi.
He should know why he did what he did.	Kufanele azi ukuthi kungani enze lokhu akwenzile.
I got my whole team.	Ngithole lonke iqembu lami.
He did not.	Akazange .
He may say too much.	Angase asho kakhulu.
There is a long wait.	Kukhona ukulinda isikhathi eside.
I think you did a fool.	Ngicabanga ukuthi wenza isilima.
And there is enough time.	Futhi kukhona isikhathi esanele.
I do not believe so.	Angikholwa kanjalo mina.
I don't believe he can do that again.	Angikholwa ukuthi angaphinde akwenze lokho.
It should not be too hard to find.	Akufanele kube nzima kakhulu ukuthola.
Maybe he didn't think it was right.	Mhlawumbe wayengacabangi ukuthi kufanele.
But you know what.	Kodwa uyazi ukuthini.
Soon he came.	Ngokushesha weza.
This should not have happened, as before.	Lokhu bekungafanele kwenzeke, njengakuqala.
You know, to me.	Uyazi, kimi.
Eventually, he appeared.	Ekugcineni, wavele .
Obviously, the same thing.	Ngokusobala, into efanayo.
She is not in her bed.	Akekho embhedeni wakhe.
Obviously at my school.	Kusobala esikoleni sami.
He knew it would not happen.	Wayazi ukuthi ngeke kube njalo.
He knows that.	Wazi kanjalo.
It does not mean that you are a bad person.	Akusho ukuthi ungumuntu omubi.
He took the advice.	Wathatha iseluleko.
I need a car.	Ngidinga imoto.
Feeling anything new to me.	Ukuzwa noma yini entsha kimi.
It can be a big person or not.	Kungaba umuntu omkhulu noma cha.
He is a real man.	Uyindoda impela.
He can't have that.	Angeke abe nakho lokho.
Here, there is none.	Lapha, akukho.
But I can't go on.	Kodwa angikwazi ukuqhubeka.
And just be it.	Futhi kube nje.
It could be me.	Kungase kube yimina.
He desperately wanted to move on.	Wayefuna kabi ukuqhubeka.
I can't have a family.	Angikwazi ukuba nomndeni.
Finally one of us had to speak.	Ekugcineni omunye wethu kwadingeka akhulume.
I have to get it all right.	Kufanele ngithole konke ngendlela efanele.
But that should not be here or there.	Kodwa lokho akufanele kube lapha noma lapho.
You want an answer right away.	Ufuna impendulo ngaso leso sikhathi.
Not alone, though.	Hhayi ngedwa, noma kunjalo.
It should be done today.	Kufanele kwenziwe namuhla.
Or good enough.	Noma muhle ngokwanele.
He did not want to talk too much.	Wayengafuni ukukhuluma kakhulu.
This is a lot of money.	Imali eningi lena.
There is more going on here than that.	Kuningi okwenzeka lapha kunalokho.
But there is a problem there.	Kodwa kukhona inkinga lapho.
There is always another way.	Kukhona njalo enye indlela.
Not that we did it too much.	Hhayi ukuthi sikwenze kakhulu.
I can totally.	Ngingakwazi ngokuphelele.
I mean he can be, if he has to be.	Ngisho ukuthi angaba njalo, uma kufanele abe njalo.
He never stopped talking about it.	Akazange ayeke ukukhuluma ngakho.
Or to be a friend.	Noma ukuba umngane.
He is not here yet.	Akekho lapha okwamanje.
He will stay with us.	Uzohlala nathi .
I’ve never seen much in him myself.	Angikaze ngibone okuningi kuye mina.
Wherever you go, you must go.	Lapho uya khona, kumele aye.
Or the whole answer needs to come quickly.	Noma kudingeka yonke impendulo eze ngokushesha.
How to cook food.	Ukupheka kanjani ukudla.
This is definitely a great try.	Lokhu nakanjani ukuzama okukhulu.
He could not quit his job because of him.	Akakwazanga ukuyeka umsebenzi wakhe ngenxa yakhe.
To be honest, he doesn't have the time.	Ukukhuluma iqiniso, akanaso isikhathi.
A nice and very good dinner.	Isidlo sakusihlwa esihle futhi muhle kakhulu.
You will stay with me here in the house.	Uzohlala nami lapha endlini.
I mean, no, it isn't.	Ngisho, cha, akunjalo.
He does not want to talk or eat.	Akafuni ukukhuluma noma ukudla.
Sometimes a few times.	Ngezinye izikhathi izikhathi ezimbalwa.
However, all of this just happened.	Noma kunjalo, konke lokhu kwenzeka nje.
It will happen, too.	Kuzokwenzeka, futhi.
I want you to eat regularly.	Ngifuna udle njalo.
Great food.	Ukudla okukhulu.
I hope you feel better soon.	Ngethemba ukuthi uzizwa engcono maduze.
Not great, but beautiful anyway.	Akuyona enkulu, kodwa enhle noma kunjalo.
But, really, you are wrong.	Kodwa, ngempela, unephutha.
I really should have known.	Impela bekumele ngazi.
Good question though.	Umbuzo omuhle kodwa.
Still, he could not restrain himself.	Noma kunjalo, akakwazanga ukuzibamba.
I can't think this way.	Angikwazi ukucabanga ngale ndlela.
Or maybe outside.	Noma mhlawumbe ngaphandle.
But he is a boy.	Kodwa ungumfana.
You need your permission.	Ufuna imvume yakho.
Not then.	Hhayi ngaleso sikhathi.
I should not even say.	Akufanele ngisho ukusho.
He doesn't know when, but he knows it will happen.	Akazi ukuthi nini, kodwa uyazi ukuthi kuzokwenzeka.
This would be great to see.	Lokhu kungaba kuhle ukukubona.
Tomorrow night.	Kusasa ebusuku.
And, not so here.	Futhi, akunjalo lapha.
I felt an accident in the area.	Ngezwa ingozi endaweni.
Is that right ?.	Ingabe kulungile lokho?.
And none of us.	Futhi akekho kithi.
I want to do something for myself.	Ngifuna ukwenza okuthile ngami.
And he didn't want one, either.	Futhi wayengafuni eyodwa, futhi.
But it doesn't have to be you.	Kodwa akumele kube nawe.
But it is hard to say anything.	Kodwa kunzima ukusho okuthile.
He thought of telling the truth, too.	Wacabanga ukukhuluma iqiniso, futhi.
Here, he simply could not say.	Lapha, akakwazanga nje ukusho.
I wanted to hear.	Bengifuna ngizwe.
You talk to me about everything.	Ukhuluma nami yonke into.
We didn't have much time.	Asizange sibe nesikhathi esiningi kakhulu.
There is nothing he can do about it.	Akukho angakwenza ngakho.
That went very well.	Lowo uhambe kahle kakhulu.
Okay, maybe a little bit.	Kulungile, mhlawumbe kancane.
The friend did not come.	Umngane akazange afike.
We should have this.	Kufanele sibe nalokhu.
Not with him anymore.	Hhayi naye futhi.
That's exactly what we do.	Kunjalo njengoba senza.
Right now! 	Khona manje!
And I'm so glad to see you.	Futhi ngijabule kakhulu ukukubona.
But you know about that.	Kodwa uyazi ngalokho.
You will come back with him.	Uzobuya naye.
He did not want to hear this.	Wayengafuni ukuzwa lokhu.
No, not everywhere.	Hhayi, hhayi yonke indawo.
Just talking in the city.	Ukukhuluma nje edolobheni.
There is no one answer hours.	Ayikho impendulo eyodwa amahora.
That's all this.	Yilokho konke lokhu.
He made a shotgun outside.	Wenza isibhamu ngaphandle.
That doesn't mean you should not buy a house.	Lokho akusho ukuthi akufanele uthenge indlu.
Now he went up.	Manje waya phezulu.
You would like to see more about him.	Ungathanda ukubona okuningi ngaye.
Done here now.	Kwenziwe lapha manje.
Maybe you wish you were taller.	Mhlawumbe ufisa ukuba mude.
That person is really good.	Muhle impela lowo muntu.
You need to stay.	Udinga ukuhlala.
I think it will be easier.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kuzoba lula.
We make food.	Senza ukudla.
Very much.	Kakhulu .
He should have known by then.	Kumele ngabe wayazi ngaleso sikhathi.
No, it's better than that.	Cha, kungcono kunalokho.
But that is your problem.	Kodwa inkinga yakho leyo.
But that sounds good.	Kodwa lokho kuzwakala kulungile.
Now, that will not happen.	Manje, lokho ngeke kwenzeke.
And he walks very fast.	Futhi uhamba ngokushesha kakhulu.
But he did, and he did it.	Kodwa wakwenza, nawe wakwenza.
And not just to us, but to the world.	Futhi hhayi kithi kuphela, kodwa emhlabeni.
But he made the right choice.	Kodwa wenza ukukhetha okufanele.
You know, for a long time.	Uyazi, isikhathi eside.
You just need to see it.	Udinga nje ukukubona.
But obviously, no.	Kodwa ngokusobala, cha.
Yes for me.	Yebo ngami.
This is no small feat.	Lokhu akuyona into encane.
I can't believe it at all.	Angikholwa nhlobo.
I actually never went there.	Empeleni angikaze ngiye lapho.
I also leave immediately.	Ngiphinde ngihambe ngokushesha.
He said he couldn't say.	Wathi akakwazi ukusho.
Nothing now.	Akukho lutho manje.
There must be something to me.	Kufanele kube khona okuthile kimi.
No, not too many.	Cha, hhayi abaningi kakhulu.
It's so much better for you.	Kungcono kakhulu kuwe.
This is not life, you know.	Lokhu akuyona impilo, uyazi.
This should have been done by now.	Lokhu bekufanele kwenziwe okwamanje.
I wanted help.	Bengifuna usizo.
Without him, of course.	Ngaphandle kwakhe, kunjalo.
And it has been good about it.	Futhi kube kuhle ngakho.
I thought that was it.	Ngangicabanga ukuthi yilokho.
I would like to go back to my house.	Ngingathanda ukubuyela endlini yami.
And at the same time.	Futhi ngaso leso sikhathi.
It will not be easy to learn.	Ngeke kube lula ukufunda.
It may happen soon.	Kungase kwenzeke maduze.

Or you know.	Noma uyazi.
In all that has happened to me.	Kukho konke okwenzekile kimi.
I think about him a lot.	Ngicabanga ngaye kakhulu.
Not his job.	Hhayi umsebenzi wakhe.
But he doesn't think of me.	Kodwa akacabangi ngami.
We have to do.	Kufanele senze.
I want your friend.	Ngifuna umngane wakho.
He did not say so.	Akazange asho kanjalo.
Yes it is.	Yebo kunjalo .
I'm very here.	Ngilapha kakhulu.
That's what my mother did.	Wenza kanjalo umama.
It can also be a very small thing.	Kungase futhi kube yinto encane kakhulu.
But you really can't go anywhere.	Kodwa empeleni awukwazi ukuya ndawo.
That happened a few years ago now.	Lokho kwenzeka eminyakeni embalwa edlule manje.
It is not power.	Akuwona amandla.
Instead you want to talk to me.	Kunalokho ufuna ukukhuluma nami.
You want a new job, right?	Ufuna umsebenzi omusha, akunjalo?
Lots of stuff, actually.	Izinto eziningi, empeleni.

Still, you should have been there.	Noma kunjalo, kwakufanele ngabe ukhona.

You need to find another way.	Udinga ukuthola enye indlela.
He will be living here.	Uzobe ehlala lapha.
I know this is new.	Ngiyazi ukuthi mina lena entsha.
I feel confident.	Ngizizwa ngiqinisekile.
My father really wants me to go.	Ubaba ufuna ngihambe ngempela.
He does not want to go home.	Akafuni ukuya ekhaya.
You can't do it.	Ngeke ukwenze.
I think you should not go.	Ngicabanga ukuthi akufanele uhambe.
No redo, no fix, nothing.	Akukho ukwenza kabusha, akukho ukulungisa, akukho lutho.
You better go without me.	Kungcono uhambe ngaphandle kwami.
I mean you're a teacher.	Ngisho ukuthi unguthisha.
Let me tell you about it.	Ake ngikutshele ngakho.
She thought she was beautiful.	Wayecabanga ukuthi muhle.
But that is probably why.	Kodwa kungenzeka ukuthi kungani.
I know you are curious.	Ngiyazi ufisa ukwazi.
He couldn't stay here with her, he just couldn't.	Wayengeke ahlale lapha naye, wayengeke nje.
The problem.	Inkinga .
I don't see how that can happen.	Angiboni ukuthi lokho kungenzeka kanjani.
Or without him.	Noma ngaphandle kwakhe.
And we need to act fast.	Futhi kudingeka senze ngokushesha.
I easily panicked, too.	Ngesaba kalula, futhi.
And another name.	Futhi elinye igama.
You don't have to be better than me at all.	Awudingi ukuba ngcono kunami kukho konke.
Because that's our job.	Ngoba umsebenzi wethu lowo.
You do not need any more.	Awudingi enye futhi.
There is so much to learn.	Kuningi ukufunda okumele ukwenze.
If something sounds good, maybe it is.	Uma okuthile kuzwakala kulungile, mhlawumbe kunjalo.
You should never think that.	Akumele neze ucabange lokho.
If so, you probably knew everything.	Uma kunjalo, cishe wayazi konke.
Yesterday he did just that.	Izolo wenze lokho kanye.
Probably had to.	Cishe kwadingeka.
Let another go.	Ahambe omunye.
I should not have done that.	Bekungafanele ngenze lokho.
He is also a student.	Naye ungumfundi.
Maybe not much is happening there.	Mhlawumbe akukho okuningi okwenzekayo lapho.
Probably wind.	Mhlawumbe umoya.
The best thing in the world.	Into enhle kakhulu emhlabeni.
My mother sat down.	Umama wahlala phansi.
He should not see such a thing.	Akumele abone into enjalo.
Do you really think there.	Ingabe ucabanga ngempela lapho.
Will you be at all.	Ingabe uzoba nhlobo.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbe akufanele kube khona.
I found the door.	Ngithole umnyango.
That is not always a good thing.	Akuyona into enhle njalo leyo.
I know you have to do this.	Ngiyazi ukuthi kufanele ukwenze lokhu.
It is best to take only one at a time.	Kungcono ukuthatha eyodwa kuphela ngesikhathi.
I think that is possible.	Ngicabanga ukuthi lokho kungenzeka.
Sometimes, you can't sleep.	Ngezinye izikhathi, awukwazi ukulala.
Certainly not everything.	Impela akuyona yonke into.
So in high school.	Ngakho esikoleni esiphakeme.
But it is true, yes.	Kodwa kuyiqiniso, yebo.
Not because of him, but me.	Hhayi ngenxa yakhe, kodwa mina.
You have to do it.	Kufanele wenze njalo.
It could be anything else.	Kungaba yini futhi.
You have to tell me everything.	Kumele ungitshele konke .
And he is not at home.	Futhi akekho ekhaya.
But almost everyone learns to talk.	Kodwa cishe wonke umuntu ufunda ukukhuluma.
The meeting could not have gone smoothly.	Umhlangano ubungeke uhambe kahle.
Yes, yes, that would be much better.	Yebo, yebo, lokho kuzoba ngcono kakhulu.
But this will not be done.	Kodwa lokhu ngeke kwenziwe.
She had to stay there and be beautiful.	Kwakufanele ahlale lapho futhi abe muhle.
I think tomorrow is the same.	Ngicabanga kusasa kunjalo.

Well done.	Ukwenze kahle.
Thinking about everything.	Ukucabanga ngakho konke.
Really nice place.	Indawo enhle ngempela.
In the meantime, we need another room.	Okwamanje, sifuna elinye igumbi.
It's not our marriage.	Akuwona umshado wethu.
I always stay in my place.	Ngihlala ngihlala endaweni yami.
Just him.	Yena nje .
You did not always try to find people.	Awuzange uhlale uzama ukuthola abantu.
He knew he could have it.	Wayazi ukuthi angaba nakho.
All presence.	Ukuba khona konke.
Maybe you go slowly.	Mhlawumbe uhamba kancane kancane.
So is his view.	Ngakho umbono wakhe.
Tell me exactly what happened.	Ngitshele kahle ukuthi kwenzakalani.
I need to know what you want.	Ngidinga ukwazi ukuthi uyafuna.
That is not my opinion.	Akuwona umbono wami.
I want you to have it.	Ngifuna ube nakho.
Maybe I'm a little happy.	Mhlawumbe ngijabule kancane.
So, you know.	Ngakho, uyazi.
I want another baby.	Ngifuna enye ingane.
Our home has done well.	Umuzi wethu wenze kahle.
And still nothing happens.	Futhi namanje akukho okwenzekayo.
You will not have to do it alone.	Ngeke kudingeke ukwenze wedwa.
And maybe nothing up there at all.	Futhi mhlawumbe akukho lutho phezulu lapho nhlobo.
I like being alone.	Ngithanda ukuba yedwa.
He did not always do this, he realized.	Akazange akwenze lokhu njalo, waqaphela.
I need to stop this.	Ngidinga ukuyeka lokhu.
Lo, lo.	Lowo, lowo.
He can't just think.	Akakwazi ukucabanga nje.
It's hard to see that this is not my fault.	Kunzima ukubona ukuthi akulona iphutha lami.
Tell me all about him.	Ngitshele konke ngaye.
Always have it at the restaurant.	Njalo ube nakho endaweni yokudlela.
Maybe this, of course.	Mhlawumbe lokhu, impela.
He looked up in amazement.	Wabheka phezulu emangele.
Still, I have to go to school.	Noma kunjalo, kufanele ngiye esikoleni.
I couldn't get out of it.	Angikwazanga ukuphuma kukho.
That time should have been now.	Leso sikhathi bekufanele kube manje.
Trying to get in.	Ezama ukungena.
Unless he obviously did.	Ngaphandle kokuthi kusobala wakwenza.
So yes, a few more days.	Ngakho yebo, ezinye izinsuku ezimbalwa.
I did this on my own.	Lokhu ngikwenze ngedwa.
If it happens, that's fine.	Uma kwenzeka, kuhle.
But only in the end.	Kodwa kuphela ekugcineni.
I know he can do that.	Ngiyazi ukuthi angakwenza lokho.
That is not all there is to it.	Akukhona konke lapho.
But this is actually the case.	Kodwa lokhu empeleni kunjalo.
He knew he wouldn't say anything.	Wayazi ukuthi ngeke asho lutho.
You have been saying this for a long time.	Kade usho lokhu.
I probably shouldn’t have been talking about it.	Cishe akufanele ngabe ngikhuluma ngakho.
But he knew he had to eat.	Kodwa wayazi ukuthi kufanele adle.
He did nothing in the house.	Akazange enze lutho endlini.
But it is possible for them to build that way.	Kodwa kungenzeka ukuba bakhe kanjalo.
It may be longer.	Kungase kube khona isikhathi eside.
You wouldn't say.	Ubungeke ukusho.
He cannot walk or sit.	Akakwazi ukuhamba noma ukuhlala.
Are you coming ???.	Uyeza???.
Really, she is beautiful.	Ngempela, muhle.
I do the same thing, the same way, all the time.	Ngenza into efanayo, ngendlela efanayo, ngaso sonke isikhathi.
But that is my opinion.	Kodwa lowo umbono wami.
But he too.	Kodwa naye futhi.
But it had to be.	Kodwa kwakufanele kube njalo.
He asked for another.	Wacela enye.
I really like talking to you.	Ngithanda ngempela ukukhuluma nawe.
So let me be clear about this.	Ngakho ake ngikhulume kahle ngalokhu.
Let me talk about it a little bit.	Ake ngikhulume ngakho kancane.
For me, that's fine.	Kimi, kuhle.
I have never spent time in prison.	Angikaze ngenze isikhathi ejele.
No, he did not.	Hhayi naye wavuma.
It can be a dress too.	Kungaba ingubo futhi.
It's hard some days.	Kunzima ngezinye izinsuku.
Now there is one more thing.	Manje kunento eyodwa futhi.
Trying to leave early.	Ezama ukuhamba kusenesikhathi.
He really wanted to get out, he really got out.	Wayefuna ngempela ukuphuma, ngempela waphuma.
Next year, yes.	Ngonyaka ozayo, yebo.
We know that to be true.	Siyazi ukuthi lokho kuyiqiniso.
He could not think so.	Akakwazanga ukucabanga kanjalo.
And he wanted to be.	Futhi wayefuna ukuba.
He did not say what happened.	Akazange asho ukuthi kwenzekeni.
I got a lot of you.	Ngithole okuningi kwakho.
You are not really.	Awuyena ngempela.
And, after all, he did well.	Futhi, ngemva kwakho konke, wenza kahle.
You better get going.	Kungcono uthole ukuqhubeka.
That it is.	Ukuthi kunjalo.
And you have a good time.	Futhi unesikhathi esihle.
I don't think he got many.	Angicabangi ukuthi wathola abaningi.
You should be able to get there.	Kufanele ukwazi ukufika lapho.
I want to talk about it now.	Ngifuna ukukhuluma ngakho manje.
The food is good, too.	Ukudla kuhle, futhi.
One more thing, too.	Enye into, futhi.
However he did not appear at night.	Noma kunjalo akazange abonakale ebusuku.
I know we know.	Mina ukuthi siyazi.
Not always, but not always.	Hhayi njalo, kodwa hhayi njalo.
This is best for you.	Lokhu kungcono kakhulu kuwe.
I did not hear anything.	Angizange ngizwe lutho.
I really want to know.	Ngifuna ukwazi ngempela.
But that is a fact.	Kodwa lokho kuyiqiniso.
You must have heard enough.	Kumele ngabe wezwa ngokwanele.
I think that is not true.	Ngicabanga ukuthi lokho akulona iqiniso.
He knows he has to have it.	Uyazi ukuthi kufanele abe nakho.
I think everyone should do that now.	Ngicabanga ukuthi wonke umuntu kuzofanele akwenze lokho manje.
We want to know about you.	Sifuna ukwazi ngawe.
Of course not!	Yebo, ngeke.
Very good for you.	Kuhle impela kuwe.
I know, you might like something more.	Ngiyazi, ungathanda okuthile okwengeziwe.
He really got into it.	Wangena ngempela.
And you really can't.	Futhi ngempela awukwazi.
I would like to think about it.	Ngingathanda ukucabanga ngakho.
My word is not true.	Izwi lami akulona iqiniso.
And that's not even the whole picture.	Futhi lokho akusona ngisho isithombe sonke.
I thought of him.	Ngacabanga yena.
It will take more.	Kuzothatha okwengeziwe.
It would be a good thing to do.	Kungaba into enhle ukuyenza.
Not one house at a time.	Hhayi indlu eyodwa ngesikhathi.
He decided it was her.	Wanquma ukuthi nguye.
In fact, we know.	Empeleni, siyazi.
He should have had enough time, of course.	Bekufanele abe nesikhathi esanele, impela.
But she hoped he would be her friend.	Kodwa wayenethemba lokuthi uzoba umngane wakhe.
Not a girl.	Hhayi intombi.
I wanted to get out of it.	Ngangifuna ukuphuma kukho.
My mind wants to play with me.	Umqondo wami ufuna ukudlala ngami.
Maybe something else.	Mhlawumbe okunye .
This is not just a party.	Lena akuyona nje iphathi.
We have to find a way.	Kuzofanele sithole indlela.
I feel it once.	Ngizwa kanye.
He talked to me.	Wakhuluma nami.
He wants me to do it regularly.	Ufuna ngikwenze njalo.
I said, good job.	Ngathi, muhle umsebenzi.
How good, but not.	Kuhle kangakanani, kodwa cha.
Every day, even.	Nsuku zonke, ngisho.
But there is more now.	Kodwa kukhona okwengeziwe manje.
It seems like sometimes.	Kubonakala sengathi ngezinye izikhathi.
He came home and went into his room.	Wafika ekhaya wangena ekamelweni lakhe.
That sounds hard.	Lokho kuzwakala kunzima.
I just do the work in your house.	Ngenza umsebenzi nje endlini yakho.
To him or to me.	Kuye noma kimi.
Maybe someone should go.	Mhlawumbe othile kufanele ahambe.
Lots of travel.	Ukuhamba okuningi.
This way there is nothing.	Ngale ndlela akukho lutho.
Because it hurts.	Ngoba ubuhlungu.
Maybe that's right.	Mhlawumbe lokho kulungile.
This function is fully functional.	Lo msebenzi usebenza ngokuphelele.
Not so, either.	Akunjalo, futhi.
When something happens something.	Uma kwenzeka kwenzeka okuthile.
Still, it can be helpful.	Noma kunjalo, kungaba usizo.
And in the morning.	Futhi ekuseni .
My mother died and my father stayed.	Umama washona futhi ubaba wahlala.
Everything has to be done right.	Konke kufanele kwenziwe ngendlela efanele.
He did not say, but he did not have to.	Akazange akusho, kodwa kwakungadingeki ukuba akwenze.
But so.	Kodwa ngakho.
This can only happen, now.	Lokhu kungenzeka nje, manje.
He said nothing about it.	Akazange asho lutho ngakho.
I know you are right.	Ngiyazi ukuthi usho kahle.
To even go there.	Ukuya ngisho khona.
How much work.	Kazi malini.
No one else did that.	Akekho omunye owenza lokho.
And, let's go to the beginning.	Futhi, ake siye ekuqaleni.
You try to get more sleep.	Uzama ukulala okwengeziwe.
Probably a lifetime.	Mhlawumbe impilo yonke.
At least it seems so.	Okungenani kubonakala kunjalo.
And if you want me to talk to you.	Futhi uma ufuna ngikhulume nawe.
This could be something else.	Lokhu kungaba okunye.
You know what you want to do and why.	Uyazi ukuthi ufuna ukwenzani nokuthi kungani.
He has been here many times.	Uhlale lapha izikhathi eziningi.
He often reads when he speaks.	Uvame ukufunda lapho ekhuluma.
Maybe even family.	Mhlawumbe ngisho nomndeni.
School teacher.	Uthisha wesikole.
We cannot speak here.	Asikwazi ukukhuluma lapha.
I am always happy to help people.	Ngihlale ngijabule ukusiza abantu.
And your work here is very good.	Futhi umsebenzi wakho lapha muhle kakhulu.
My family is John now.	Umndeni wami uJohn manje.
Also, I'm not sure why.	Futhi, angiqiniseki ukuthi kungani.
There is no other way or another.	Ayikho enye indlela noma enye.
He wanted to talk about it.	Wayefuna ukukhuluma ngakho.
He just wanted a little something.	Wayefuna into encane nje.
It may be easier to work with.	Kungase kube lula ukusebenza ngakho.
We found his coffee.	Sithole ikhofi lakhe.
You just need to work a few hours.	Udinga nje ukusebenza amahora ambalwa.
It looks real.	Kubukeka kuyiqiniso.
No, there is no one at the door.	Cha, akukho muntu emnyango.
I wanted something else.	Bengifuna okunye.
Really, this is okay.	Ngempela, lokhu kulungile.
Same house.	Indlu efanayo.
We do that over and over again.	Senza lokho kaningi.
It was difficult to fix the problem.	Kube nzima ukulungisa inkinga.
He looked like that.	Wayebonakala enjalo.
Or maybe me.	Noma mhlawumbe mina.
i want these.	ngifuna lezi.
You do that and you will stay here for the rest of your life.	Wenza kanjalo futhi uzohlala lapha impilo yakho yonke.
Just seeing everything.	Ukubona konke nje.
It is not a city.	Akuwona umuzi.
But this is the thing.	Kodwa lena into.
But, this is very good.	Kodwa, lokhu kuhle kakhulu.
He did it again.	Ukwenzile futhi.
I never found out how.	Angizange ngithole ukuthi kanjani.
I would like to.	Ngingathanda .
Indeed, many times that is true.	Ngempela, izikhathi eziningi lokho kuyiqiniso.
You would not know when.	Ubungeke wazi ukuthi nini.
She can't eat breakfast.	Akakwazi ukudla isidlo sasekuseni.
I think you do too.	Ngicabanga ukuthi nawe wenza kanjalo.
He took his time and did a good job.	Wathatha isikhathi sakhe futhi wenza umsebenzi omuhle.
Do your homework.	Wenze umsebenzi wakho wesikole.
You can't get out of the house.	Awukwazi ukuphuma endlini.
Everything is very good in your own way.	Konke kuhle kakhulu ngendlela yakho.
I mean something big.	Ngisho into enkulu.
It happens, sometimes.	Kwenzeka, ngezinye izikhathi.
Tomorrow will be better.	Kusasa kuzoba ngcono.
That's your business.	Indaba yakho leyo.
Very good.	Kuhle kakhulu .
It should not be long now.	Akumele kube isikhathi eside manje.
I would not be without him now.	Bengingeke ngibe ngaphandle kwakhe manje.
There is no answer.	Akukho lapho impendulo.
Another answer is that we want to get into it.	Enye impendulo ukuthi sifuna ukungena.
Now he just agreed.	Manje wavele wavuma.
But there is one.	Kodwa kukhona eyodwa.
I think you are the best person in the world.	Ngicabanga ukuthi ungumuntu omuhle kakhulu emhlabeni.
It’s even harder to think about it.	Kuze kube nzima ukucabanga ngakho.
Again, this is a choice.	Futhi, lokhu ukukhetha.
First, he could not live.	Okokuqala, wayengeke akwazi ukuphila.
You can know.	Ungakwazi ukwazi.
There is, however.	Kukhona kodwa.
My father also did not.	Ubaba naye akazange.
Nothing, but everything is there.	Akukho lutho, kodwa konke kukhona.
He could not continue.	Akakwazanga ukuqhubeka.
Not always, but it happens.	Hhayi ngaso sonke isikhathi, kodwa kwenzeka.
He wanted her to know.	Wayefuna ukuthi azi.
You really need to learn to be alone with yourself.	Udinga ngempela ukufunda ukuba wedwa nawe.
I'm not sure what it is, exactly.	Angiqiniseki ukuthi yini, impela.
Anyone I don’t know why not do it.	Noma ubani angazi ukuthi kungani ungakwenzi.
Yes, it is safe to say that.	Yebo, kulungile ukusho lokho.
I really didn't know anything.	Impela ngangingazi lutho.
And if so, that's fine with you.	Futhi uma kunjalo, kuhle kuwe.
You will not tell anyone this.	Ngeke utshele muntu lokhu.
You, at least.	Wena, okungenani.
And never dad.	Futhi neze ubaba.
My opinion.	Umbono wami.
Let me tell you what happened to me.	Ake ngikutshele ukuthi kwenzekani kimi.
Completely done.	Kwenziwe ngokuphelele.
Or you, obviously.	Noma wena, ngokusobala.
He did not know anyone.	Wayengazi muntu.
But he can't drive.	Kodwa akakwazi ukushayela.
He is the one who does so.	Nguye owenza njalo.
He said he was afraid to come home.	Wathi uyesaba ukuza ekhaya.
Now is the time.	Manje isikhathi.
I should have known.	Bekufanele ngabe ngazi.
I know it has to happen.	Ngiyazi ukuthi kufanele kwenzeke.
He can know that.	Angakwazi lokho.
I don't know what we should be.	Angazi ukuthi kufanele sibe njalo.
Did that happen a few times.	Ngabe lokho kwenzeka izikhathi ezimbalwa.
Not too fast, and not too long.	Hhayi ngokushesha, futhi hhayi isikhathi eside kakhulu.
I want to know the best way to do this.	Ngifuna ukwazi indlela engcono kakhulu yokwenza lokhu.
That’s all good and good.	Lokho konke kuhle futhi kuhle.
That, that, that one didn't know.	Lokho, lokho, lowo wayengazi.
Here, let me.	Lapha, ngivumele .
He spent weeks in the hospital.	Wahlala amasonto esibhedlela.
At home, not a bit.	Ekhaya, hhayi kancane.
How? 	Kanjani?
You're very nice.	Ungumuntu okahle kakhulu.
I did not wait to receive.	Angizange ngilinde ukuthola.
That is not a long time.	Akusona isikhathi eside leso.
He wanted a lie.	Wayefuna amanga.
He came out alone.	Waphuma yedwa.
Just a new person.	Umuntu omusha nje.
But not in the same way.	Kodwa hhayi ngendlela efanayo.
Really nice.	Impela ube muhle.
This is not a question.	Akuwona umbuzo lo.
As you did to him.	Njengoba wenze kuye.
We all know what he means.	Sonke siyazi ukuthi usho ukuthini.
Not fast enough.	Akunjalo ngokushesha ngokwanele.

Probably so.	Mhlawumbe kunjalo ngokuphelele.
This had to happen.	Lokhu bekufanele kwenzeke.
Maybe you should reconsider.	Mhlawumbe kufanele ucabange kabusha.
I couldn’t stop fast enough.	Angikwazanga ukuyeka ngokushesha ngokwanele.
Yes, you down.	Yebo, wena phansi.
You are awaiting a decision.	Ulindele isinqumo.
I need a picture.	Ngidinga isithombe.
He wanted me to come.	Wayefuna ngize.
At least you will have that.	Okungenani uzoba nakho lokho.
He came every night.	Wafika njalo ebusuku.
I don't want you to go either.	Nami angifuni uhambe.
There you will come.	Lapho uzofika.
I'm just telling my truth.	Ngikhuluma iqiniso lami nje.
But here you have to be.	Kodwa lapha kufanele ube.
This is not a good picture.	Akusona isithombe esihle lesi.
Thus, a problem may arise.	Ngakho, kungase kwenzeke inkinga.
I didn't even know that.	Ngangingazi nokuthi.
He said he was coming.	Wathi uyeza.
He said it was good for you.	Wathi kuhle kuwe.

It is best to do a little.	Kungcono kakhulu ukwenza kancane.
I'm so glad to have you today.	Ngijabule kakhulu ukuba nawe namuhla.
He and you, I'm sure.	Yena kanye nawe, ngiqinisekile.
That happened three years ago and still is.	Lokho kwenzeka eminyakeni emithathu edlule namanje.
It is by no means a new problem.	Akuyona neze inkinga entsha.
He never came to me.	Akazange eze kimi.
I like being alone.	Ngithanda ukuba wedwa.
Her father died a few years ago.	Ubaba wakhe washona eminyakeni embalwa edlule.
Or, maybe, a little better.	Noma, mhlawumbe, kahle kancane.
Please stay with us.	Ngicela ahlale nathi.
He’s just a good player.	Ungumdlali omuhle nje.
That is all that is happening right now.	Yilokho kuphela okwenzekayo njengamanje.

You will also need to know how it sounds too.	Uzodinga futhi ukwazi ukuthi kuzwakala kanjani futhi.
He does this for all of us.	Wenza lokhu kithi sonke.
One always wants more.	Umuntu uhlale efuna okwengeziwe.
But that is a choice.	Kodwa lokho ukukhetha.
I want you to be happy.	Ngifuna uhlale ujabule.
I wish everyone could do it.	Ngifisa sengathi wonke umuntu ungakwenza.
I'm sure it won't happen.	Ngiyaqiniseka ukuthi ngeke kwenzeke.
That's a lot.	Kube kuningi lokho.
He really wanted to get into work.	Wayefuna ngempela ukungena emsebenzini.
Slowly, now.	Kancane kancane, manje.
It should not have been done.	Kwakungafanele kwenziwe.
I do not like this at all.	Angikuthandi nhlobo lokhu.
I really want to have this in my school.	Ngifuna ngempela ukuba nalokhu esikoleni sami.
And, not least, his music.	Futhi, hhayi okungenani, umculo wakhe.
And well.	Futhi kahle.

He knows he has to do it.	Uyazi ukuthi kuzofanele enze njalo.
Now everyone is here.	Manje wonke umuntu ulapha.
I need to get my gun.	Ngidinga ukuthola isibhamu sami.
He probably never saw it happen that way.	Mhlawumbe akazange abone ukuthi kwenzeka ngale ndlela.
He said he was not alone.	Wathi kwakungeyena yedwa.
But you just want to see your gift worse.	Kodwa ufuna nje ukubona isipho sakho kabi.
You do not really know.	Awazi ngempela.
But, he made a decision.	Kodwa, wathatha isinqumo.
Big dog, little dog, whatever.	Inja enkulu, inja encane, noma yini.
Hours, maybe.	Amahora, mhlawumbe.
Maybe a doctor.	Mhlawumbe udokotela.
Now he knows what to do.	Manje uyazi ukuthi yini okufanele ayenze.
We all do well here at home.	Sonke senza kahle lapha ekhaya.
I mean, if he wants to.	Ngisho, uma efuna.
He did not want to leave his room.	Wayengafuni ukuphuma ekamelweni lakhe.
Yes, indeed.	Yebo, impela.
No, no, he says.	Cha, cha, uthi.
And you made too many mistakes.	Futhi wenze amaphutha amaningi kakhulu.
I just want to sing.	Ngifuna nje ukucula.
I wanted you to know before you left.	Bengifuna wazi ngaphambi kokuthi uhambe.
No tests.	Akukho ukuhlolwa.
I can do it.	Ngingakwenza .
Children.	Izingane .
Or dad, or.	Noma ubaba, noma.
The more you read, the more you know.	Lapho ufunda kakhulu, wazi okwengeziwe.
It happened really fast for me.	Kwenzeka ngokushesha ngempela kimi.
You told me that too.	Nawe ungitshele lokho.
That's fine with me.	Kulungile kimi lokho.
You can go to a bigger place later.	Ungakwazi ukuya endaweni enkulu kamuva.
You probably know him.	Cishe uyazi yena.
Right now, we just need to get the job done.	Njengamanje, sidinga nje ukwenza umsebenzi.
He lives in my house.	Uhlala endlini yami.
There is power.	Kukhona amandla.
Yes, not just in bed.	Yebo, hhayi embhedeni kuphela.
He just agreed.	Wavele wavuma.
Whether you know it or not.	Ukuthi uyazi noma cha.
So that's not the way to do it.	Ngakho akuyona indlela yokwenza kanjalo.
But there is one thing you need to know.	Kodwa kunento eyodwa okudingeka uyazi.
You do not really want to know.	Awufuni ngempela ukwazi.
How do you know.	Wazi kanjani.
But that seems to be the case.	Kodwa kubukeka sengathi kunjalo.
He always wants me for him.	Uhlala engifuna ngaye.
He looked like that.	Wabheka kanjalo.
Finally he said no.	Ekugcineni wathi cha.
There's just you, here and now.	Kukhona wena nje, lapha futhi manje.
I wanted to smoke.	Ngangifuna ukubhema.
But we will not do this.	Kodwa ngeke sikwenze lokhu.
But not everyone.	Kodwa akuwona wonke umuntu.
He wanted to help people.	Wayefuna ukusiza abantu.
You do not have to do this work.	Asikho isidingo sokuthi wenze lo msebenzi.
And it means nothing to us, not really.	Futhi akusho lutho kithi, hhayi ngempela.
All of that will happen.	Konke lokho kuzokwenzeka.
I want a friend, a friend,.	Ngifuna umngane, umngane, .
I have to tell.	Kufanele ngitshele.
I would not allow anyone to do that.	Bengingeke ngivumele muntu ukuthi enze lokho.
I just want to be friends.	Ngifuna ukuba abangane kuphela.
But what a good thing.	Kodwa yini enhle.
And, of course, the books.	Futhi, kunjalo, izincwadi.
This is not a problem but a gift.	Lena akuyona inkinga kodwa isipho.
You will know that you exist.	Uzokwazi ukuthi ukhona.

You should know about me, by this time, enough.	Kufanele wazi ngami, ngalesi sikhathi, ngokwanele.
I know you're here, somewhere.	Ngiyazi ulapha, ndawo ndawo.
That too is not true.	Nalokho akulona iqiniso.
If you can, that's fine.	Uma ukwazi, kuhle lokho.

But, I got another one.	Kodwa, ngithole enye futhi.
Very little by little.	Kakhulu kancane kancane.
It's really hard to say.	Kunzima ngempela ukusho.
At least not yet, before he knew anything.	Okungenani hhayi okwamanje, ngaphambi kokuthi azi lutho.
It will take energy.	Kuzothatha amandla.
And not in a bad way.	Futhi hhayi ngendlela embi.
No phone rides.	Akukho ukugibela ucingo.

At least for now.	Okungenani okwamanje .

He wanted to go, badly.	Wayefuna ukuhamba, kabi.
But it was not to be.	Kodwa kwakungafanele kwenzeke.
We did it slowly.	Senze kancane kancane.
Later, he said that he probably knew.	Kamuva, wathi mhlawumbe uyazi.
Probably possible.	Mhlawumbe kungenzeka.
I mean, nothing at all.	Ngisho ngempela, lutho nhlobo.
No one wants to make a decision.	Akekho ofuna ukwenza isinqumo.
You want to say yes.	Ufuna ukuthi yebo.
I will do it when we get home.	Ngizokwenza uma sifika ekhaya.
This should be easy to spot.	Lokhu kufanele kube lula ukukubona.

He did not want to be alone again.	Wayengafuni ukuba yedwa futhi.
And a big question.	Futhi umbuzo omkhulu.
Right now it could be better.	Njengamanje kungaba ngcono.
Maybe he's asleep.	Mhlawumbe ulele.
Depending on the job.	Kuye ngomsebenzi.
Me? 	Mina?
I know there is nothing there.	Ngiyazi akukho lutho lapho.

Your father too.	Ubaba wakho futhi.
It may be so but not always.	Kungaba njalo kodwa hhayi njalo.
All of this is not true.	Konke lokhu akulona iqiniso.
He watched the program.	Wabuka uhlelo.
I can't go on without your help.	Angikwazi ukuqhubeka ngaphandle kosizo lwakho.
This is probably not the case, though.	Lokhu cishe akunjalo, noma kunjalo.
Walking all day.	Ukuhamba usuku lonke.
First time.	Okokuqala isikhathi.
He is not my father.	Akuyena ubaba wami.
Only everything is not visible.	Kuphela konke akuyona into ebonakala.

I really wish I was.	Ngifisa ngempela ukuba.
Everyone knew and no one did anything.	Wonke umuntu wayazi futhi akekho owenza lutho.
So he decided to do something about it.	Ngakho wanquma ukwenza okuthile ngakho.
All three times.	Zonke izikhathi ezintathu.

It seems that this should not be so difficult.	Kubonakala sengathi lokhu akufanele kube nzima kangako.
It will not be good for him.	Ngeke kube kuhle kuye.
But you do not have to be a doctor.	Kodwa akudingekile ukuba udokotela.

Finally, but not yet.	Ekugcineni, kodwa hhayi okwamanje.
It must be a mistake.	Kufanele kube iphutha.
He thought he was going to do a great job.	Wayecabanga ukuthi uzokwenza umsebenzi omkhulu.
But he would not say that.	Kodwa wayengeke akhulume kanjalo.
Just really fast.	Ngokushesha nje ngempela.
It happened for a long time.	Kwenzeka isikhathi eside.
But, that is not here and it is not there.	Kodwa, lokho akukho lapha futhi akukho lapho.
That would only be a good thing.	Lokho kungaba yinto enhle kuphela.

I wouldn't be around him now.	Bengingeke ngibe eduze kwakhe manje.
Not here, not now, not like this.	Hhayi lapha, hhayi manje, hhayi kanje.
He didn't really think about it.	Wayengacabangi ngempela ngakho.

I do not want anyone to think so.	Angifuni kube khona ocabanga kanjalo ngami.
Now at least he talked to her.	Manje okungenani wakhuluma naye.
But he would not stop now.	Kodwa ubengeke ayeke manje.
I'm glad this is what happened.	Ngiyajabula ukuthi lokhu okwenzekile.
Not that he thought he should.	Hhayi ukuthi wayecabanga ukuthi kufanele.
I think you are the best in the world.	Ngicabanga ukuthi ungcono kakhulu emhlabeni.
Because my mother did it every night.	Ngoba umama wenza njalo ebusuku.
He may be.	Angase abe.
And it's you.	Futhi nguwe.
You will not be able to hold it in the least.	Ngeke ukwazi ukuzibamba ngisho kancane.
He also asked why.	Naye wabuza ukuthi kungani.
Something bad, something bad.	Okuthile okubi, into embi.
The police did so.	Amaphoyisa enze njalo.
Drinking regularly.	Ukuphuza ngaso sonke isikhathi.
Not only that, but you can do it very quickly.	Akukhona lokho kuphela, kodwa ungakwenza ngokushesha okukhulu.
Today and every day from now on.	Namuhla futhi zonke izinsuku kusukela manje.
He can do it.	Uyakwazi ukukwenza.
She feels good.	Uzizwa kahle.
And there is at least one other big case.	Futhi kukhona okungenani elinye icala elikhulu.
There is a cat, too.	Kukhona ikati, futhi.
Is it? 	Ingabe?
No house at all.	Ayikho indlu nhlobo.
It's better to go.	Kungcono ukuhamba.
I will do anything to be with you.	ngizokwenza noma yini ukuze ngibe nawe.
He got there.	Wafika lapho.
She is beautiful to him.	Muhle kuye.
It is never the same thing.	Akuyona neze into efanayo.
Please let me do this.	Ngicela ngenze lokhu.
He won’t look too much, or go too far.	Angeke abonakale kakhulu, noma ahambe kakhulu.
I would like you to think about that.	Ngingathanda ukuthi ucabange ngalokho.
I say to him.	Ngisho kuye.
Or, this morning.	Noma, namhlanje ekuseni.
We went the same way.	Sihambe ngendlela efanayo.
And he may.	Futhi angase.
Yes, this would be nice.	Yebo, lokhu kungaba kuhle.
To see you.	Ukukubona.
Being you is something new now.	Ukuba nguwe yinto entsha manje.
I think it's power.	Ngicabanga ukuthi amandla.
That is not what you want to do.	Lokho akukhona ofuna ukukwenza.
To be him again.	Ukuze abe nguye futhi.
But you did well.	Kodwa wenze kahle.
But not your mother.	Kodwa hhayi umama wakho.
But he says.	Kodwa uthi.
But you need to go now.	Kodwa udinga ukuhamba manje.
What a response.	Yeka impendulo.
I make good money.	Ngenza imali enhle.
But you will do the best you can.	Kodwa uzokwenza into engcono kakhulu.
I'll have to think about it.	Kuzofanele ngicabange ngakho.
And when we get to the end.	Futhi lapho sifika ekugcineni.
Not many things, but some things.	Hhayi izinto eziningi, kodwa ezinye izinto.
We can't do it here.	Asikwazi ukuzenza lapha.
And he wanted the truth.	Futhi wayefuna iqiniso.
Another story everyone knows.	Enye indaba wonke umuntu owaziyo.
Mom doesn't have time.	Umama akanaso isikhathi.
I think you want the truth.	Ngicabanga ukuthi ufuna iqiniso.
And yes.	Futhi yebo.
He stayed for three days.	Wahlala izinsuku ezintathu.
So this is the story.	Ngakho lena indaba.
Most of the time the answer is no.	Isikhathi esiningi impendulo ayikho.
But no one wants that.	Kodwa akekho ofuna lokho.
Too bad you can't see that.	Okubi kakhulu ukuthi awukwazi ukukubona lokho.
I should have done this right.	Bekufanele ngiyenze kahle le nto.
He wants to help you.	Ufuna ukukusiza.
The boy will know in a few years.	Umfana uzokwazi eminyakeni embalwa.
I need to be alone.	Ngidinga ukuba ngedwa.
This is a very new approach.	Lena indlela entsha kakhulu.
You need to see a doctor.	Udinga ukubona udokotela.
You will not do it here.	Ngeke ukwenze lapha.
I just don’t know how I did this.	Angazi nje ukuthi ngikwenze kanjani lokhu.
You are completely wrong about that.	Unephutha ngokuphelele kulokho.
Anything can happen out here.	Kungenzeka noma yini lapha ngaphandle.
But in the end anything is possible.	Kodwa ekugcineni kungenzeka noma yini.
We need to find strength.	Kudingeka sithole amandla.
How so.	Yeka ukuthi kunjalo.
You want to be that way, all right.	Ufuna ukuba njalo, kulungile.
But that will happen.	Kodwa lokho kuzokwenzeka.
You can't find what's in there.	Awukwazi ukuthola ukuthi yini lapho.
He could not enter.	Akakwazanga ukungena.
And now, with this.	Futhi manje, nalokhu.
What does that, in order.	Yini eyenza lokho, ukuze.
He was not sure how.	Wayengazi kahle ukuthi kanjani.
But that's just dinner.	Kodwa lokho nje isidlo sakusihlwa.
I actually thought about this all the time.	Empeleni bengicabanga lokhu ngaso sonke isikhathi.
Only not as before.	Kuphela hhayi njengakuqala.
At least he's talking to me.	Okungenani ukhuluma nami.
A few days or a week up.	Izinsuku ezimbalwa noma isonto phezulu.
This is your decision, of course.	Lesi isinqumo sakho, kunjalo.
You need to stop doing this.	Udinga ukuyeka ukwenza lokhu.
Your family is beautiful.	Umndeni wakho muhle.
That can be anyone.	Lokho kungaba noma ubani.
But we will not go there.	Kodwa ngeke siye lapho.
I think he is not.	Ngicabanga ukuthi akekho.
There is a possibility that it is not true.	Kukhona ithuba lokuthi akulona iqiniso.
He returned to the house.	Wabuyela endlini.
But churches work.	Kodwa amasonto umsebenzi.
If you say so to me.	Uma uthi nami.
I didn't have to be there.	Kwakungadingeki ngibe lapho.
Or it should be, at least.	Noma kufanele kube njalo, okungenani.
Not at night, though.	Hhayi ebusuku, noma kunjalo.
He once did that, once.	Wake wakwenza lokho, kanye.
Everything looks the right way.	Konke kubukeka ngendlela efanele.
He was a little surprised.	Wamangala kancane.
Too big, actually.	Okukhulu kakhulu, empeleni.
It definitely should be.	Kufanele nakanjani kube.
Or it may be for now.	Noma kungenzeka okwamanje.
Maybe he will, he thought.	Mhlawumbe uzokwenza njalo, wacabanga.
No big deal.	Ayikho indaba enkulu.
I think that's all.	Ngicabanga ukuthi yilokho konke.
He wanted to see the city.	Wayefuna ukubona umuzi.
So today is the day.	Ngakho namuhla usuku.
I would not do that now.	Bengingeke ngikwenze lokho manje.
Maybe you are happy.	Mhlawumbe ujabule.
But I am very happy to learn that you are better.	Kodwa ngijabule kakhulu ukufunda ukuthi ungcono.
You must make your decision now.	Kufanele wenze isinqumo sakho manje.
I know, there aren’t many tests.	Ngiyazi, akukho ukuhlolwa okuningi.
This is not always true.	Akulona iqiniso ngaso sonke isikhathi.
But my friend all this.	Kodwa umngane wami konke lokhu.
He finally did.	Ekugcineni ukwenzile.
I like that though.	Ngithanda kanjalo kodwa.
She saw a doctor.	Wabona udokotela.
But in doing so he got.	Kodwa ngokwenza lokho wathola.
This happens once a week.	Kwenzeka kanjalo kanye ngesonto.
Maybe not because of you, but me.	Mhlawumbe hhayi ngenxa yakho, kodwa mina.
Do you know .	Ingabe uyazi .
You would not be there.	Ubungeke ube khona.
My mother could not.	Umama wayengeke akwazi.
He will not talk about her.	Ngeke akhulume ngaye.
You need food.	Udinga ukudla.
You do not need a key to get this one going.	Awudingi ukhiye ukuze lo ahambe.
A little bit of it all really.	Kancane kancane kwakho konke ngempela.
I know he has to think that everyone is asleep.	Ngiyazi ukuthi kumele acabange ukuthi wonke umuntu ulele.
It can't be done, though.	Ngeke kwenziwe, noma kunjalo.
He is sleeping today.	Ulele namuhla.
We have made it clear.	Sikwenze kwacaca.
Obviously, this can be difficult.	Ngokusobala, lokhu kungase kube nzima.
He did not want to say anything.	Wayengafuni ukukhuluma lutho.
If he wants money, he has to come back.	Uma efuna imali, kuzomele abuye.
I know now that he is not thinking at all.	Ngiyazi manje ukuthi akacabangi nhlobo.
It happens a few days a week.	Kwenzeka izinsuku ezimbalwa ngesonto.
And that, of course, is right for me.	Futhi lokho, kunjalo, kulungile kimi.
And not always with me.	Futhi hhayi njalo nami.
It is possible to do this anyway.	Kungenzeka ukwenza lokhu noma kunjalo.
It's not like you live alone.	Hhayi sengathi uhlala yedwa.
No, definitely not too soon.	Cha, nakanjani maduze kakhulu.
He started at home.	Waqala ekhaya.
We did not go to the party last night.	Asizange siye emcimbini izolo ebusuku.
I wanted to work with him.	Ngangifuna ukusebenza naye.
Or he could do anything.	Noma angenza noma yini.
Slowly here in my house.	Kancane kancane lapha endlini yami.
She thought to herself.	Wacabanga yena.
My flesh.	Inyama yami.
Finally he said he would do it.	Ekugcineni wathi uzokwenza.
But we know that is not true.	Kodwa siyazi ukuthi lokho akulona iqiniso.
But he likes to play.	Kodwa uthanda ukudlala.
He also stays a few days.	Naye uhlala izinsuku ezimbalwa.
But he had to do it his way.	Kodwa kwakudingeka enze ngendlela yakhe.
Kube.	Kube .
What else and one thing.	Yini enye futhi into eyodwa.
Great group.	Iqembu elikhulu.
Tomorrow may be yesterday.	Kusasa kungase kube izolo.
But my life.	Kodwa impilo yami.
I wish it could happen more often.	Ngifisa sengathi kungenzeka kaningi.
You can't do anything you want to do here.	Awukwazi ukwenza noma yini ofuna ukuyenza lapha.
Now we know that this is also true.	Manje siyazi ukuthi nalokhu kuyiqiniso.
My life.	Impilo yami.
You eat a lot, which is why.	Udla kakhulu, yingakho.
Thank you, but not me.	Ngiyabonga, kodwa hhayi kimi.
But you need to talk to me.	Kodwa udinga ukukhuluma nami.
I always thought it was him, or about him.	Ngihlale ngicabanga ukuthi nguye, noma ngaye.
Still you are wrong.	Noma kunjalo unephutha.
Now because.	Manje ngoba.
He does not want any food, alone.	Akafuni ukudla okuthile, yedwa.
Not much money.	Ayikho imali eningi.
He decided to go home.	Wanquma ukuya ekhaya.
I need someone else.	Ngidinga omunye umuntu.
Hopefully hopefully !.	Ngethemba ngethemba!.
And, he probably did.	Futhi, mhlawumbe wakwenza.
I'm not sure if anyone but you know.	Angiqiniseki ukuthi kukhona kodwa owaziyo.
The meeting started without him.	Umhlangano waqala ngaphandle kwakhe.
It was supposed to be today.	Bekumele namuhla.
It is something you should know.	Yinto okufanele uyazi.
I'm glad you're gone.	Ngiyajabula ngokuthi uhambe.
It is true here on earth.	Kuyiqiniso lapha emhlabeni.
This is not the case here.	Lapha akunjalo.
And he couldn't do it.	Futhi akakwazanga ukukwenza.
He will have to try another one.	Kuzofanele azame enye.
Slowly and confidently.	Kancane futhi uqinisekile.
Sit down.	Ahlale.
i go to that.	ngiya kulokho.
That could be you.	Lokho kungaba kuwe.
At that moment, she realized something.	Ngaleso sikhathi, waqaphela okuthile.
Every so often that happens.	Njalo lokho kwenzeka.
There are many books.	Kukhona izincwadi eziningi.
And a little small.	Futhi encane encane.
In this case you cannot do that.	Kulokhu awukwazi ukwenza kanjalo.
Not from yesterday.	Akukho kusukela izolo.
I would love to do that again soon.	Ngingathanda ukwenza lokho futhi maduze.
He will do what needs to be done.	Uzokwenza okufanele kwenziwe.
I thought he was going to leave now.	Bengicabanga ukuthi uzohamba manje.
He will come alone.	Uzofika yedwa.
Isn't that right.	Akunjalo yini.
It could happen again, too.	Kungenzeka futhi, futhi.
We are all in the same school.	Sonke esikoleni esisodwa.
So, buy time.	Ngakho, uthenge isikhathi.
But you know one thing.	Kodwa wazi into eyodwa.
Either going to school or getting a job.	Noma ukuya esikoleni noma ukuthola umsebenzi.
He immediately made a decision.	Ngokushesha wathatha isinqumo.
At the moment he did not have time.	Njengamanje wayengenaso isikhathi.
It's been a real ride.	Kube ukugibela impela.
This is a book.	Lena incwadi.
He saw the door.	Wabona umnyango.
Not often, though.	Akunjalo kaningi, kunjalo.
I am everything so far.	Yimi konke kuze kube manje.
So much for getting a gun.	Kakhulu ukuthola isibhamu.
There will be no going home anytime soon.	Ngeke kube khona ukuya ekhaya maduze.
But it can be anything.	Kodwa kungaba noma yini.
I want us to be together always.	Ngifuna sibe ndawonye njalo.
He received a few books.	Wathola izincwadi ezimbalwa.
He opened one, and began to read.	Wavula eyodwa, waqala ukufunda.
Going right now.	Ukuhamba njengamanje.
No, that's not me.	Cha, akumina lowo.
And very soon, actually.	Futhi ngokushesha impela, empeleni.
I want me and him all.	Ngifuna mina naye wonke.
It's better without him.	Kungcono ngaphandle kwakhe.
She's really good, you know.	Muhle ngempela, uyazi.
This really happens a lot.	Lokhu kwenzeka kakhulu empeleni.
Because again that is possible.	Ngoba futhi lokho kungenzeka.
I don't know any other way.	Angazi enye indlela.
He said he would know.	Wathi uzokwazi.
And indeed, it is.	Futhi ngempela, kunjalo.
Just like that.	Njengoba enjalo nje.
You are so wrong about me.	Unephutha kakhulu ngami.
Yes it is true.	Yebo kuyiqiniso.
You read early and often.	Ufunda kusenesikhathi futhi kaningi.
We all know how you feel about yourself.	Sonke siyazi ukuthi uzizwa kanjani ngawe.
That's exactly wrong.	Iphutha impela lelo.
You thought so too.	Nawe wacabanga kanjalo.
Very good in the summer.	Kahle kakhulu ehlobo.
He got something.	Wathola okuthile.
Stop trying to do something.	Yeka ukuzama ukuyenza into.
I can go on for a long time.	Ngingakwazi ukuqhubeka isikhathi eside.
I wanted to be that way.	Bengifuna ukuba njalo.
We have done a very good job.	Senze umsebenzi omuhle kakhulu.
He was not sure what exactly.	Wayengenaso isiqiniseko sokuthi yini ngempela.
Because his mother saw no.	Ngoba umama wakhe abone ukuthi cha.
She was wearing only a few clothes.	Wayegqoke izingubo ezimbalwa kuphela.
Maybe next week.	Mhlawumbe ngesonto elizayo.
Stop this now.	Yeka lokhu manje.
But there are questions.	Kodwa kukhona imibuzo.
But he heard someone.	Kodwa wezwa umuntu.
In my place! 	Endaweni yami!
I'm not sure.	angiqiniseki.
But again, he did not want to.	Kodwa futhi, wayengafuni.
I know it will not happen.	Ngiyazi ngeke kwenzeke.
He was afraid to tell you the truth at that moment.	Wayesaba ukukutshela iqiniso ngaleso sikhathi.
But the other is probably true.	Kodwa okunye cishe kuyiqiniso.
It happens, that's all.	Kwenzeka, yilokho kuphela.
He should think so.	Kufanele acabange kanjalo.
She decided to talk about him.	Wanquma ukukhuluma ngaye.
It could be your job.	Kungase kube umsebenzi wakho.
Getting married in a park.	Ukushada epaki.
With that too.	Ngalokho futhi.
Because you can move on.	Ngoba ungakwazi ukuqhubeka.
You did very well with this.	Wenze kahle kakhulu ngalokhu.
Looks like it now too.	Kubukeka sengathi manje futhi.
And he was very scared.	Futhi wayesaba kakhulu.
I mean, you might be wrong.	Ngisho, kungenzeka ukuthi unephutha.
I will not go there.	Ngeke ngiye lapho.
I need him to do something.	Ngidinga ukuthi enze okuthile.
No answer at all.	Ayikho impendulo nhlobo.
Yesterday, you told me I had made time.	Izolo, ungitshele ukuthi ngenze isikhathi.
It's very difficult now.	Kunzima kakhulu manje.
He doesn't want you to think about it.	Akafuni ukuthi ucabange ngakho.
He wasn't sure he wanted to stay.	Wayengenaso isiqiniseko sokuthi ufuna ahlale.
Tom might be able to.	UTom angase akwazi.
He wants you to do that, too.	Ufuna wenze lokho, nawe.
It did not last long.	Akuzange kube isikhathi eside kangako.
He is coming our way.	Uyeza ehamba indlela yethu.
I knew it was possible.	Ngangazi ukuthi kungenzeka.
I too would have been very happy.	Nami ngabe ngijabule kakhulu.
No, that sounds good.	Cha, kuzwakala kulungile.
After all.	Ngaphandle kwakho konke.
We do a lot of things.	Senza izinto eziningi.
Obviously this is too much.	Ngokusobala lokhu kuningi kakhulu.
Maybe both.	Mhlawumbe bobabili.
No matter how often he tries.	Noma ezama kaningi kangakanani.
It's going to be a terrible thing.	Kuzoba yinto embi kabi.
I want to die.	Ngifuna ukufa.
I wonder what happened to him.	Kazi kwenzakalani kuye.
But death did occur.	Kodwa ukufa kwenzeka.
He did not eat but one.	Akazange adle kodwa eyodwa.
He should not have been there.	Bekungafanele abe lapho.
He is always there.	Uhlala njalo lapho.
He went back there and did it.	Wabuyela lapho futhi wakwenza.
Good, good man.	Umuntu omuhle, omuhle.
So you can't go with me.	Ngakho awukwazi ukuhamba nami.
That would be great.	Lokho kungaba kuhle kakhulu .
I think we all have a lot to do.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kuningi okufanele sikwenze sonke.
Eventually that happened.	Ekugcineni kwenzeka lokho.
Police are everywhere.	Amaphoyisa yonke indawo.
This will be very difficult to do.	Lokhu kuzoba nzima kakhulu ukukwenza.
I need a better way to do this.	Ngidinga indlela engcono yokwenza lokhu.
But you are better.	Kodwa wena ungcono.
Obviously, it did not.	Ngokusobala, akuzange.
He could not go without her.	Wayengeke ahambe ngaphandle kwakhe.
And maybe everyone in the world.	Futhi mhlawumbe wonke umuntu emhlabeni.
He has never spoken to me in this way.	Akakaze akhulume nami ngale ndlela.
We did it again tonight.	Sikwenze futhi namuhla ebusuku.
But you say you are not.	Kodwa uthi awuyena.
And that's it for now.	Futhi yilokho okwamanje.
There is no exit to this.	Akukho ukuphuma kulokhu.
But that's all for now.	Kodwa lokho kuphela okwamanje.
He could not think of problems.	Wayengeke acabange izinkinga.
Thank you, well.	Ngiyabonga, kahle.
I have never done this before.	Angizange ngikwenze lokhu ngaphambili.
This should be done once.	Lokhu kufanele kwenziwe kanye.
Nailed it.	Ngikwenze kahle.
It will have to be done regularly.	Kuzodingeka kwenziwe njalo.
So it has to be another way.	Ngakho kufanele kube enye indlela.
That was all he needed to know.	Yilokho kuphela okwakudingeka akwazi.
She is always beautiful.	Muhle njalo.
And very quickly.	Futhi ngokushesha okukhulu.
Or maybe just kids.	Noma mhlawumbe izingane nje.
Maybe not tomorrow, but soon.	Mhlawumbe hhayi kusasa, kodwa maduze.
There is plenty of life too, but death is everywhere.	Kuningi ukuphila futhi, kodwa ukufa kukhona yonke indawo.
And now it seems that this is okay.	Futhi manje kubonakala sengathi lokhu kulungile.
But let me say one thing.	Kodwa ake ngisho into eyodwa.
I wanted more from him.	Ngangifuna okwengeziwe kuye.
Not just this time, but earlier.	Hhayi nje lesi sikhathi, kodwa ngaphambili.
You can do that later.	Ungakwenza lokho kamuva.
I do not really want to get into trouble.	Angifuni ngempela ukungena enkingeni.
Have it for a week, enough.	Ube nakho ngesonto, ngokwanele.
If you want to go to a party in the evening, that's fine.	Uma ufuna ukuya emcimbini kusihlwa, kuhle.
You will.	Uzoba .
Thank you, but no thank you.	Ngiyabonga, kodwa cha ngiyabonga.
That's his thing.	Into yakhe leyo.
Also, this is something you probably never want to do.	Futhi, lena into cishe awufuni neze ukuyenza.
That is not our job.	Lokho akuwona umsebenzi wethu.
I never talked to him, either.	Angizange ngikhulume naye, futhi.
Almost still.	Cishe namanje.
He is trying another approach.	Uzama enye indlela.
I wanted my book.	Bengifuna incwadi yami.
It's not just a crime, either.	Akulona nje icala, futhi.
Yes you should.	Yebo kufanele ube.
Just everything.	Konke nje.
He wants to know.	Ufisa ukwazi.

That's a long time.	Isikhathi eside leso.
Either way at all.	Noma iyiphi indlela nhlobo.
You know this one is coming.	Wazi ukuthi uyeza lo.
No one does it this way.	Akekho owenza ngale ndlela.
Things will happen.	Kuzokwenzeka izinto.
He looks, to me, a little curious.	Ubukeka, kimi, efuna ukwazi kancane.
That is very clear to us.	Lokho kusobala ngokuphelele kithi.
I would very much like to quit.	Ngingathanda kakhulu ukuyeka.
Books books.	Izincwadi izincwadi.
All right, here.	Konke kulungile, lapha.
But he had to leave.	Kodwa kwadingeka ahambe.
Such a small house.	Indlu encane kangaka.

I always thought that.	Ngihlale ngicabanga lokho.
There is no one way to do it.	Ayikho indlela eyodwa yokwenza.
Almost none of us do that.	Cishe akekho kithi owenza kanjalo.
Until the day there.	Kuze kube usuku lapho .
That is especially true today.	Lokho kuyiqiniso kakhulu namuhla.
Sometimes he was not.	Ngezinye izikhathi wayengekho.
It looks bad on the outside.	Kubukeka kabi ngaphandle.
At school the same story.	Esikoleni indaba efanayo.
It could happen fast all over the world.	Kungase kwenzeke ngokushesha emhlabeni wonke.
Playing the piano.	Ukudlala upiyano.
John is very talented.	UJohn unekhono kakhulu.
Without you.	Ngaphandle nawe.
The mother should know that.	Umama kufanele akwazi lokho.
We could not get an answer.	Asikwazi ukuthola impendulo.
I never went to his room at night.	Angikaze ngiye ekamelweni lakhe ebusuku.
He wanted to spend more time at home.	Wayefuna ukuchitha isikhathi esengeziwe ekhaya.
She is beautiful and beautiful.	Muhle futhi muhle.
Looking for a new job.	Ufuna umsebenzi omusha.

But be nice to her.	Kodwa ube muhle kuye.
You will not know that.	Ngeke ukwazi lokho.
And he does not want to.	Futhi akafuni.
This can only be good.	Lokhu kungaba kuhle kuphela.
I have never heard of this.	Angikaze ngizwe ngalokhu.
I wanted to hear his voice again.	Ngangifuna ukuzwa izwi lakhe futhi.
I do not always know why.	Angazi njalo ukuthi kungani.
He saw an opportunity through us.	Wabona ithuba ngathi.
How can that be.	Kungaba kanjani lokho.
He started spending all his time there.	Waqala ukuchitha sonke isikhathi sakhe lapho.
That happened a lot.	Lokho kwenzeka kakhulu.
I just couldn't do it.	Angikwazanga nje ukwenza.
Eyes slightly.	Amehlo kancane.
We also know what he looked like.	Siyazi nokuthi wayebukeka kanjani.
You should already know all of this already.	Kufanele ukwazi konke lokhu kakade.
But perhaps he would not do that.	Kodwa mhlawumbe wayengeke akwenze lokho.
It is not a complete lie.	Akuwona amanga ngokuphelele.
He did not consider taking anyone.	Akazange acabange ukuthatha muntu.

It shouldn't have happened, of course.	Bekungafanele kwenzeke, kunjalo.
You want to do very well.	Ufuna ukwenza kahle kakhulu.
We want to play a good side.	Sifuna ukudlala icala elihle.
So, apparently, he did not know how to drive my car.	Ngakho, ngokusobala, wayengazi ukushayela imoto yami.
We all want the same thing.	Sonke sifuna into efanayo.
I will not be !.	Ngeke ngibe!.
He said this was possible.	Wathi lokhu kungenzeka.
I don't know what you really want to do.	Angazi ukuthi ufuna ukwenzani ngempela.
Not up.	Hhayi phezulu.
But he told the truth.	Kodwa wakhuluma iqiniso.
My mother never said.	Umama akakaze asho.
I asked who.	Ngabuza bani.
But he could not find out how.	Kodwa akakwazanga ukuthola ukuthi kanjani.
He knew there was.	Wayazi ukuthi kukhona.
We did things the right way.	Senze izinto ngendlela efanele.
Good, of course, but difficult.	Kuhle, kunjalo, kodwa kunzima.
You've never been there.	Awukaze ube lapho.
Or in the evening.	Noma kusihlwa.
He is determined to be just that.	Uzimisele ukuba yilokho.
You just have to do it really well.	Kufanele nje ukwenze kahle ngempela.
It will take work.	Kuzothatha umsebenzi.
He just did it.	Ukwenze nje.
But these.	Kodwa lezi .
I am going to town tomorrow.	Ngiya edolobheni kusasa.
But there is more.	Kodwa futhi okunye.
The doctor is there.	Udokotela ukhona.
You talk to him.	Ukhuluma naye.
Not a big meeting.	Hhayi umhlangano omkhulu.
Lying down.	Ukulala phansi.
The City also agreed.	Wavuma futhi uMuzi.
Still no sound.	Namanje akuwona umsindo.
You did well all this time.	Wenze kahle sonke lesi sikhathi.
He certainly did.	Impela ukwenzile.
You need to stay in this for a long time.	Udinga ukuhlala kulokhu isikhathi eside.
He may know something, that's all.	Angase azi okuthile, yilokho kuphela.
Many of me.	Abaningi bami.
You know, that's not at all.	Uyazi, akuyena nhlobo lowo.
But, it's hard to just get out of town.	Kodwa, kunzima ukuphuma nje edolobheni.
And you really mean that.	Futhi ngempela usho lokho.
Maybe a long shot.	Mhlawumbe isibhamu eside.
I found a picture of her and her family.	Ngithole isithombe sakhe nomndeni wakhe.
If you don't do it, don't do it for us.	Uma ungakwenzi, ungakwenzi ngenxa yethu.
She is not in the room.	Akekho ekamelweni.
Time is my biggest problem though.	Isikhathi inkinga yami enkulu kodwa.
Error taking this function.	Iphutha ukuthatha lo msebenzi.
But not yet for me.	Kodwa hhayi okwamanje kimi.
It is not a bad health.	Akuyona impilo embi.
I don't think you should be.	Angicabangi ukuthi kufanele ube.
I need to do this often.	Ngidinga ukwenza lokhu kaningi.
You can't even.	Awukwazi ngisho.
It's better if you go.	Kungcono uma uhamba.
This is not a big deal.	Lena akuyona into enkulu kangaka.
Someone wants to do that.	Umuntu ufuna ukwenza lokho.
Good idea, right ?.	Umbono omuhle, akunjalo?.
He knew enough about it already.	Wayazi ngokwanele ngakho kakade.
Thirty years is not that long.	Iminyaka engamashumi amathathu akusona isikhathi eside kangako.
There is almost no more.	Cishe akukho okuningi.
Not true, nothing happens.	Akulona iqiniso, akukho okwenzekayo.
I should not stay long.	Akufanele ngihlale isikhathi eside.
His spirit improved.	Umoya wakhe waba ngcono.
We both know that this is not true.	Sobabili siyazi ukuthi lokhu akulona iqiniso.
It did not have to happen this way.	Kwakungadingeki ukuba kwenzeke ngale ndlela.
I love all power.	Ngithanda wonke amandla.
Really, he knew nothing.	Kanjani ngempela, wayengazi lutho.
I like working alone.	Ngithanda ukusebenza ngedwa.
At least in the morning.	Okungenani ekuseni.
Maybe he shouldn’t have said that.	Mhlawumbe bekungafanele akusho lokho.
That he can buy.	Ukuthi akwazi ukuthenga.
And so it is.	Futhi kunjalo .
Yes, that's the problem.	Yebo, inkinga leyo.
I feel like he can't stop.	Ngizwa sengathi akakwazi ukuyeka.
For the better, though.	Ukuze kube ngcono, noma kunjalo.
I found great though.	Ngithole okukhulu kunjalo.
Everyone needs to be alone sometimes.	Wonke umuntu udinga ukuba yedwa ngezinye izikhathi.
She is really scared.	Wesaba ngempela.
I wanted time with my family.	Ngangifuna isikhathi nomndeni wami.
I wonder why.	Ngiyazibuza ukuthi kungani.
You have to go.	Kuzomele uhambe .
No one else out there.	Akekho omunye ngaphandle lapho.
Yes, that's really good.	Yebo, lokho kuhle ngempela.
How it all happened in the end.	Indlela okwenzeka ngayo konke ekugcineni.
So thank you very, very much.	Ngakho ngiyabonga kakhulu, kakhulu.
How long does he not work?	Kuze kube nini akazi.
I will do well.	Ngizokwenza kahle.
Not a good name.	Akulona igama elihle.
He saw something else at the time, too.	Wabona enye into ngaleso sikhathi, futhi.
I think you know that too.	Ngicabanga ukuthi uyakwazi lokho nathi.
I did not know how long it would take.	Ngangingazi ukuthi kuzothatha isikhathi esingakanani.
The door, he thought.	Umnyango, wacabanga.
I can't say for sure.	Angikwazi ukusho kahle.
If so, it is.	Uma kunjalo, kunjalo.
No hearing at all.	Akukho ukuzwa nhlobo.
That can happen if you live in your own home.	Lokho kungenzeka uma uhlala endlini yakho.
I never thought it was possible.	Angikaze ngicabange ukuthi kungenzeka.
He does not know how to say this.	Akazi ukuthi akusho kanjani lokhu.
Well, that's his opinion.	Kulungile, lowo umbono wakhe.
She is so beautiful to me.	Muhle kimi kanjalo.
Someone who makes this happen.	Umuntu owenza lokhu kwenzeke.
I asked for money.	Ngacela imali.
But this seems to be all or nothing.	Kodwa lokhu kubonakala sengathi konke noma lutho.
Hopefully so.	Ngethemba kunjalo.
I know this very well.	Ngikwazi lokhu kakhulu.
You may have heard someone else.	Mhlawumbe uke wezwa omunye umuntu.
I doubt you trust anyone.	Ngiyangabaza ukuthi uthemba noma ubani.
I really don't know anything.	Impela angazi lutho.
Nothing happens at all.	Akukho nhlobo okwenzekayo.
How he felt.	Wazizwa kanjani.
She's afraid she knows too much.	Uyesaba ukuthi wazi kakhulu.
Or, instead, we did.	Noma, kunalokho, senze.
But this is not the case and it should not be.	Kodwa lokhu akunjalo futhi akufanele kube njalo.
No one does this.	Akekho owenza lokhu.
You need to be your best friend.	Kufanele ube umngane wakho omkhulu.
You know you did too.	Uyazi nawe ukwenzile.
So he should not still be here.	Ngakho akufanele namanje abe lapha.
He decided to do something about it.	Wanquma ukwenza okuthile ngakho.
She is beautiful, both of them.	Muhle, bobabili.
What a help, he did not know.	Usizo yini, wayengazi.
The best place.	Indawo engcono kakhulu.
That is not the case, of course.	Lokho akulona icala, yebo.
I thought you might like to see it.	Bengicabanga ukuthi ungathanda ukukubona.
If you need to get out there money.	Uma udinga ukuphuma lapho imali.
Not yet, and not yet.	Hhayi okwamanje, futhi hhayi okwamanje.
I'm not so sure why.	Angiqiniseki kakhulu ukuthi kungani kunjalo.
That happened obviously here.	Lokho kwenzeke ngokusobala lapha.
But there is something to think about.	Kodwa kukhona okumele ucabange ngakho.
I need to know what happened.	Ngidinga ukwazi ukuthi kwenzekeni.
He loves making music.	Uthanda ukwenza umculo.
He left because he wanted to be there.	Waphuma lapho ngoba efuna ukuba khona.
But maybe you can.	Kodwa mhlawumbe ungakwazi.
No, the whole universe.	Cha, indawo yonke.
He knew now.	Wayazi manje.
Sometimes a year.	Ngezinye izikhathi ngonyaka.
I never thought about it at all.	Angizange ngicabange ngakho nhlobo.
What is happening now.	Kwenzekani manje.
You know, here, too.	Uyazi, lapha, nami.
There is a group.	Kukhona iqembu.
This, in fact, is exactly what he did.	Lokhu, empeleni, yilokho kanye akwenza.
Home help or something like that.	Usizo endlini noma into enjalo.
And that sounds good.	Futhi kuzwakala kulungile.
I don't know what time you should get there.	Angazi ukuthi kufanele ufike ngasiphi isikhathi lapho.
You expect something from him.	Ulindele okuthile kuye.
Hard to fix.	Kunzima ukulungisa.
He has not returned home since yesterday.	Akakaze abuye ekhaya kusukela izolo.
Getting more does not mean getting everything.	Ukuthola okwengeziwe akusho ukuthola yonke into.
Everyone knows about it.	Wonke umuntu uyazi ngakho.
Nobody wants to work there.	Akekho ofuna ukusebenza lapho.
He did not go to work.	Akazange aye emsebenzini.
So we had to do something.	Ngakho kwakufanele senze okuthile.
There is no reason why you should be.	Asikho isizathu sokuthi kungani kufanele ube.
Too many.	Eziningi kakhulu.
He is very serious about it.	Uzimisele kakhulu ngakho.
I do not know.	Okunye angikwazi.
You are one of us.	Wena omunye wethu.
I can't do without you.	Angikwazi ukwenza ngaphandle kwakho.
Even if you just want to know about it.	Noma ngabe ufuna ukwazi ngayo kuphela.
And he tries to move on.	Futhi uzama ukuqhubeka.
He did not want to continue alone.	Wayengafuni ukuqhubeka yedwa.
You do not want friends.	Awufuni abangani.
It's not right, anyway.	Akuyona efanele, noma kanjani.
I'm convinced of that.	Ngiyaqiniseka ngakho.
We know that happens a lot.	Siyazi ukuthi lokho kwenzeka kaningi.
It would be death for me.	Kungaba ukufa kimi.
I think it should absolutely.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kufanele ngokuphelele.
You feel this way.	Uzizwa kanje.
He can't make noise.	Akakwazi ukwenza umsindo.
There is always something going on.	Kukhona njalo okwenzekayo.
But this sounds very difficult.	Kodwa lokhu kuzwakala kunzima kakhulu.
He didn't know it wasn't me.	Wayengazi ukuthi akumina.
So far, nothing is happening.	Kuze kube manje, akukho okwenzekayo.
I just want to be with you.	Ngifuna nje ukuba nawe.
He never came to my door.	Akazange eze emnyango wami.
He readily agreed.	Wavele wavuma ngokushesha.
I don't want it to happen.	Angifuni kwenzeke.
She looks really happy.	Ubonakala ejabule ngempela.
A few days, maybe.	Izinsuku ezimbalwa, mhlawumbe.
Stop getting into trouble.	Yeka ukungena enkingeni.
When this happens, no one knows what to do.	Uma lokhu kwenzeka, akekho owaziyo ukuthi enzeni.
But he did not want to do that.	Kodwa wayengafuni ukwenza lokho.
You know from the beginning.	Wazi kusukela ekuqaleni.
Or he tried.	Noma wazama .
I feel like you.	Ngizizwa njengawe.
No one thinks about this.	Akekho ocabanga ngalokhu.
I wish to do the same.	Nami ngifisa ukwenza.
Everyone agreed.	Wonke umuntu wavuma.
Mary paused.	Ahlale kancane uMary.
It is very difficult to say however.	Kunzima kakhulu ukusho noma kunjalo.
It should also be so.	Kufanele kube njalo nokuthi.
This is our house.	Indlu yethu lena.
You need one.	Udinga eyodwa.
Instead, he took a moment.	Kunalokho, wathatha kancane.
I wish someone could do something about it.	Ngifisa sengathi kukhona angenza okuthile ngaye.
Effective and slow to feel pain.	Ukusebenza kahle futhi kancane ukuzwa ubuhlungu.
He started at the top, and so did he.	Waqala phezulu, kanjalo naye.
So for me, this is not the case.	Ngakho kimi, lokhu akunjalo.
He always knew.	Ngaso sonke isikhathi wayazi.
It's all too much.	Konke kuningi kakhulu.
Is it so hard ?.	Ngabe kunzima kangaka?.
And he seems very happy about it.	Futhi ubonakala ejabule kakhulu ngakho.
I like his stuff so much.	Ngithanda izinto zakhe kakhulu.
But he would really like to try.	Kodwa angathanda ngempela ukuzama.
I'm not really sure how I can do this.	Angiqiniseki ngempela ukuthi ngingakwenza kanjani lokhu.
You made very good money, too.	Wenze imali enhle kakhulu, futhi.
He did, he took.	Wenza, wathatha.
What an opportunity for all of us.	Yeka ithuba lethu sonke.
So he says it's okay.	Ngakho uthi kulungile.
Girlfriend even.	Intombi ngisho.
I'm totally happy there, too.	Ngijabule ngokuphelele lapho, futhi.
No one does much.	Akekho owenza okuningi.
Our job is to make it happen first.	Umsebenzi wethu ukwenza ukuthi kwenzeke kuqala.
Yesterday afternoon he was asleep.	Izolo ntambama ulele.
You know that's right, too.	Uyazi ukuthi kunjalo, futhi.
I just can’t do it all myself.	Angikwazi nje ukukwenza konke mina.
Getting to that.	Ukufika kulokho.
He did not have to do anything.	Kwakungadingeki enze lutho.
We needed to find out more quickly.	Kwakudingeka sithole okuningi ngokushesha.
I'm sure he did.	Ngiqinisekile ukuthi wakwenza.
There is plenty of time.	Ukhona isikhathi esiningi.
This is not a guarantee, however, and it should not be.	Lokhu akusona isiqiniseko, noma kunjalo, futhi akufanele kube.
Me now.	Mina manje.
I can't get there.	Angikwazi ukufika lapho.
He did it then.	Wenza ngaleso sikhathi.
Sometimes it will happen and sometimes it will not.	Ngezinye izikhathi kuzokwenzeka futhi ngezinye izikhathi ngeke.
And that's exactly it.	Futhi lokho ngempela.
I have seen almost everyone here.	Ngibone cishe wonke umuntu lapha.
Tell your friend how you feel.	Tshela umngane wakho ukuthi uzizwa kanjani.
I think that sounds right.	Ngicabanga ukuthi lokho kuzwakala kulungile.
You can't imagine why.	Awukwazi ukucabanga ukuthi kungani.
He said you know about it too.	Wathi nawe uyazi ngakho.
This will take a long time.	Lokhu kuzothatha isikhathi eside.
It could be him.	Kungase kube naye.
Only when more money is needed immediately.	Kuphela lapho kudingeka imali eningi ngokushesha.
He said he would not do that.	Wathi angeke akwenze lokho.
If you don't, you won't.	Uma ungakwenzi, ngeke.
Not much.	Akukho okuningi.
And very, very much so.	Futhi kakhulu, kakhulu.
He stayed with her every day.	Wahlala naye nsuku zonke.
To tell you the truth.	Ukukutshela kahle.
I do not want you to be alone.	Angifuni ube wedwa.
What my parents said.	Okushiwo abazali bami.
If he is not, he is not.	Uma engekho, akayena.
Not that many people around.	Hhayi ukuthi abantu abaningi eduze.
It shouldn’t, at least not right now.	Akufanele, okungenani hhayi njengamanje.
I want to hear why you did this.	Ngifuna ukuzwa ukuthi kungani wenze lokhu.
But that is sometimes the case.	Kodwa kunjalo ngezinye izikhathi.
You need a lot of my time.	Udinga isikhathi sami esiningi.
Maybe that's true now.	Mhlawumbe lokho kuyiqiniso manje.
I didn’t want to think about him right now.	Ngangingafuni ukucabanga ngaye njengamanje.
But my friend did.	Kodwa umngane wami wenza.
Really hard.	Impela kunzima.
He cannot live long.	Akakwazi ukuphila isikhathi eside.
I would, but it would be a lie.	Ngingathanda, kodwa kungaba amanga.
Too bad for me.	Okubi kakhulu kimi.
He really knew.	Wayazi ngempela.
And he can do it.	Futhi angakwenza.
I doubt he can.	Ngiyangabaza ukuthi angakwazi.
You can't do it without him.	Awukwazi ukwenza ngaphandle kwakhe.
He did not come alone.	Akazange eze yedwa.
You are not thinking right now.	Awucabangi kahle njengamanje.
I think that will happen.	Ngicabanga ukuthi lokho kuzokwenzeka.
Let it happen.	Ngivumele kwenzeke.
Now it will be time.	Manje kuzoba isikhathi.
He wanted to get married.	Wayefuna ukushada.
Not much of you.	Akukho okuningi kwakho.
His voice is now speaking to him.	Kuzwakala izwi lakhe manje ekhuluma naye.
Not a bad person.	Hhayi umuntu omubi.
It is not a program at all.	Akulona uhlelo nhlobo.
A great friend to say so.	Umngane omkhulu ukukhuluma kanjalo.
So much for everything.	Kuningi kakhulu kwakho konke.
Unless there is more.	Ngaphandle kokuthi kukhona okwengeziwe.
That's just your thing.	Into yakho nje leyo.
Something else happened when he was very young.	Kukhona okunye okwenzeka esemncane.
And I need help.	Futhi ngidinga usizo.
You did as you were supposed to do.	Wenze njengoba bekufanele ukwenze.
Like me, once.	Njengami, kanye.
This is my life, my decision.	Lena impilo yami, isinqumo sami.
He did a great job too.	Wenza umsebenzi omuhle futhi.
I had no idea about that.	Ngangingacabangi lutho ngalokho.
Me, I have never.	Mina, angikaze.
Maybe dinner once in a while.	Mhlawumbe isidlo sakusihlwa kanye ngesikhathi.
And that never happened, let me tell you.	Futhi lokho akuzange kwenzeke, ake ngikutshele.
I will do anything, everything for you.	Ngizokwenza noma yini, yonke into ngawe.
But also that is not the whole story.	Kodwa futhi akuyona yonke indaba.
I'll go slow at first.	Ngizohamba kancane ekuqaleni.
That's right here hopefully.	Kunjalo lapha ngethemba.
And apparently, he said really fast.	Futhi ngokusobala, asho ngokushesha ngempela.
Everyone talked to him.	Wonke umuntu akhulume naye.
When that happens, it is.	Uma lokho kwenzeka, kunjalo.
He really was not sure about this.	Ngempela wayengenaso isiqiniseko ngalokhu.
He does everything and does it very well.	Wenza konke futhi ukwenza kahle kakhulu.
You need to think.	Kudingeka ucabange.
He returned to work immediately.	Wabuyela emsebenzini ngaso leso sikhathi.
He used to do this.	Wayevame ukwenza lokhu.
It is very difficult to say.	Kunzima kakhulu ukusho.
I try to adjust my volume.	Ngizama ukulungisa umsindo wami.
Doing a lot of things there.	Ukwenza izinto eziningi lapho.
And something happened.	Futhi kukhona okwenzekile.
He just wants to take a picture and go.	Ufuna nje ukuthatha isithombe ahambe.
It's hard, for me, to see how it happens.	Kunzima, kimi, ukubona ukuthi kwenzeka kanjani.
Or maybe.	Noma mhlawumbe .
You speak your mind, just like me.	Ukhuluma umqondo wakho, njengami nje.
So it will be a few years later.	Ngakho kuzoba iminyaka embalwa kamuva.
But he was thinking about it.	Kodwa wayecabanga ngakho.
You know my people well.	Wazi kahle abantu bami.
I'll be here all the time.	Ngizoba lapha sonke isikhathi.
I know how hard that is.	Ngiyazi ukuthi kunzima kangakanani lokho.
That doesn't mean much.	Lokho akusho okuningi.
He should have been on top.	Bekufanele abe phezulu.
I think all of that is obvious.	Ngicabanga ukuthi konke lokho kusobala.
Sounds like that.	Kuzwakala kunjalo.
We can't wait for anything.	Asikwazi ukulinda lutho.
He had better be alone.	Kungcono abe yedwa.
Maybe he just wanted to be alone.	Mhlawumbe wayefuna nje ukuba yedwa.
I think from the beginning it could be better.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kusukela ekuqaleni kungaba ngcono.
You better go home.	Kungcono uye ekhaya.
But the name.	Kodwa igama.
I feel good.	Ngizwa kahle .
Coming soon.	Uzofika maduze.
And you did a very good job.	Futhi wenze umsebenzi omuhle kakhulu.
No Exit.	Akukho ukuphuma.
I think of him.	Ngicabanga ngaye.
If this happens, stop doing our job.	Uma lokhu kwenzeka, yeka ukwenza umsebenzi wethu.
A lot has happened since yesterday.	Kuningi okwenzekile kusukela izolo.
I sat down.	Ngihlale phansi.
That is my question.	Umbuzo wami lowo.
Not yesterday, for a long time.	Hhayi izolo, isikhathi eside.
Or at least three.	Noma okungenani ezintathu.
You always want problems.	Njalo ufuna izinkinga.
And my family.	Kanye nomndeni wami.
If you do, it will be easier.	Uma wenza njalo, kuzoba lula.
So what's the big deal.	Ngakho yini into enkulu.
Yes, this is really possible.	Yebo, lokhu kungenzeka ngempela.
She may want to go with him.	Angase afune ukuhamba naye.
So at night at home and sleep.	Ngakho ebusuku ekhaya futhi ukulala.
I don't think anything about it.	Angicabangi lutho ngakho.
Who really knows, except him.	Ubani ngempela owaziyo, ngaphandle kwakhe.
He too would not know.	Naye ubengeke akwazi.
And she feels happy about it.	Futhi uzizwa ejabule ngakho.
He knew he had to do something quickly.	Wayazi ukuthi kufanele enze okuthile ngokushesha.
From all over the world.	Kusukela emhlabeni wonke.
Yes, no.	Yebo, hhayi.
You do not know how hard it is to walk.	Awazi ukuthi kunzima kangakanani ukuhamba.
Not that there should be.	Hhayi ukuthi kufanele kube khona.
Not so in the world.	Akunjalo lapha emhlabeni.
Whoever you want to be.	Noma ngabe ubani ofuna ukuba nguye.
For you.	Ukuze wena.
But it is also not necessary.	Kodwa futhi akudingekile.
He sat slowly.	Wahlala kancane kancane.
I wish to see you here.	Ngifisa ukukubona lapha.
You have to be there too.	Kufanele ube lapho nawe.
He's just talking his mind.	Ukhuluma nje umqondo wakhe.
That's not my thing.	Akuyona into yami leyo.
Only pain.	Ukuzwa ubuhlungu kuphela.
Very much all.	Kakhulu konke.
But this should not be the case with us.	Kodwa lokhu akufanele kube njalo kithi.
You want confirmation.	Ufuna isiqiniseko.
This should be done easily and simply.	Lokhu kufanele kwenziwe kalula futhi kalula.
I've been here a long time.	Ngilapha isikhathi eside.
In fact, there is.	Empeleni, kukhona.
I thought you might know.	Bengithi kungenzeka uyazi.
He really wants me to stay.	Impela ufuna ngihlale.
Not power, just years.	Hhayi amandla, iminyaka nje.
I wanted to go home.	Bengifuna ukuya ekhaya.
That can be very helpful.	Lokho kungaba usizo kakhulu.
And you can go out for a day.	Futhi ungakwazi ukuphuma usuku.
At this everyone came out.	Kulokhu wonke umuntu waphuma.
Or you are busy doing other things.	Noma umatasa wenza ezinye izinto.
Back to me.	Ukubuyela kimi.
I'm absolutely sure.	Ngiqinisekile ngokuphelele.
We know the big story.	Siyazi indaba enkulu.
That all is possible.	Lokho konke kungenzeka.
You have to be really serious.	Kufanele uzimisele ngempela.
I'll go with you a little bit.	Ngizohamba nawe kancane.
No, not at all.	Cha, neze.
Obviously he would not be helpful.	Ngokusobala wayengeke abe usizo.
I try to be very selective.	Ngizama ukukhetha kakhulu.
She says she is worried.	Uthi ukhathazekile.
Soon or something like that.	Ngokushesha noma into enjalo.
How I knew, yes.	Ngangazi kanjani, yebo.
You would not stay that long.	Ubungeke uhlale isikhathi eside kangaka.
But only you.	Kodwa wena kuphela.
All you have to do is be yourself.	Okufanele ukwenze ukuthi ube nguwe.
It is not necessary here.	Akudingekile lapha.
You read books all the time.	Ufunda izincwadi ngaso sonke isikhathi.
We did not have to.	Asizange kudingeke.
I found many errors.	Ngithole amaphutha amaningi.
I had to go home.	Bekufanele ngiye ekhaya.
Not years.	Hhayi iminyaka.
He could not stay there.	Akakwazanga ukuhlala lapho.
I don't want to hear another word about this.	Angifuni ukuzwa elinye igama ngale nto.
I have not heard anything since.	Angikaze ngizwe lutho kusukela ngaleso sikhathi.
And maybe one weekend.	Futhi mhlawumbe eyodwa ngempelasonto.
But he wanted to get in again.	Kodwa wayefuna ukungena futhi.
I wanted to make it my home.	Ngangifuna ukuyenza indlu yami.
But a little over a year.	Kodwa kancane ngonyaka.
Good now too.	Kuhle manje futhi.
One is not.	Enye ayikho.
I don’t think it could be better, not sooner.	Angicabangi ukuthi kungaba ngcono, hhayi ngokushesha.
He is lying on top.	Ulele phezulu.
I mean you know all this.	Ngisho ukuthi uyakwazi konke lokhu.
But it is true for us.	Kodwa kuyiqiniso kithi.
He exists, and he has a long time.	Ukhona, futhi unesikhathi eside.
Another one nearby.	Omunye futhi eduze.
All in the same universe.	Konke endaweni yonke efanayo.
Not bad health.	Hhayi impilo embi.
We make money, once and for all.	Senza imali, kube kanye.
Everyone was very happy last year.	Wonke umuntu ujabule kakhulu ngonyaka odlule.
I don't want to know anything about it.	Angifuni ukwazi lutho ngakho.
We both want to get married together.	Sobabili sifuna ukushada sobabili.
You would not be alone.	Ubungeke ube wedwa.
And well, if you want to go on like that.	Futhi kuhle, uma ufuna ukuqhubeka kanjalo.
And that's just what he is not.	Futhi yilokho nje ayikho.
Definitely food to think about.	Nakanjani ukudla ukucabanga.
It's got to be.	Kuzofanele abe njalo.
To expect and do.	Ukuze ulindele futhi wenze.
Slightly so.	Kancane kunjalo.
You just need to go.	Udinga ukuhamba nje.
You can only do that for a long time.	Ungakwenza lokho kuphela isikhathi eside.
I'm very happy in town this week.	Ngijabule kakhulu edolobheni kuleli sonto.
Surely everyone will do things about that.	Impela wonke umuntu uzokwenza izinto ngalokho.
He immediately left.	Ngokushesha wahamba.
And maybe he can come back.	Futhi mhlawumbe angase abuye.
I think he will stay home.	Ngicabanga ukuthi uzohlala ekhaya.
Why, she wondered.	Ngani, wazibuza.
Because maybe you're worried.	Ngoba mhlawumbe ukhathazekile.
I would not think that would be difficult for you.	Bengingeke ngicabange ukuthi lokho kungaba nzima kuwe.
That's my baby.	Ingane yami leyo.
Now it sounds like a wait.	Manje kuzwakala sengathi ukulinda.
But he had to do something.	Kodwa kwakufanele enze okuthile.
Really! 	Ngempela!
He wasn't sure what to do about it.	Wayengenaso isiqiniseko sokuthi enzeni ngakho.
Another boy asked me a question.	Omunye umfana wangibuza umbuzo.
I will go again.	Ngizohamba futhi.
He likes to go out and walk.	Uthanda ukuphuma ahambe.
I have known my whole life.	Ngiyazi impilo yami yonke.
And work.	Futhi umsebenzi.
You have to go tonight.	Kuzomele uhambe namhlanje ebusuku.
But you can't think of that now.	Kodwa awukwazi ukucabanga ngalokho manje.
Not that he wanted to.	Hhayi ukuthi wayefuna.
Now he is lying on the ground.	Manje ulele phansi.
If you did, you know.	Uma ukwenzile, uyazi.
But it is obvious that it would be a decision for both of us.	Kodwa kusobala ukuthi kungaba isinqumo sobabili.
I will do that tomorrow.	Ngizokwenza lokho kusasa.
I don't like to think about it.	Angithandi ukucabanga ngakho.
He just did it again.	Wavele wakwenza futhi.
He works very well on his own.	Usebenza kahle kakhulu eyedwa.
My family is happy for me.	Umndeni wami ujabule ngami.
A picture is not just a picture.	Isithombe akusona nje isithombe.
I wish there was something else.	Ngifisa sengathi ngabe kukhona okunye.
But I did not.	Kodwa angizange.
No waiting, just singing.	Akukho ukulinda, ukucula nje.
Well anyone.	Kahle noma ubani.
Now, whether I do it or not, I'm not sure.	Manje, ngingakwenza noma cha, anginaso isiqiniseko.
I have known this for some time.	Sekunesikhathi ngikwazi lokhu.
Maybe something will happen.	Mhlawumbe okunye kuzokwenzeka.
I was so scared.	Ngesaba kanjalo.
Not a little, but a lot.	Hhayi kancane, kodwa kakhulu.
So, it means nothing.	Ngakho, akusho lutho.
But we have to be.	Kodwa kufanele sibe njalo.
Let me go to him.	Ake ngiye kuye.
Or so.	Noma ngakho.
I would not really think.	Bengingeke ngicabange ngempela.
This is how it happened.	Lena indlela okwenzeka ngayo.
I want this to be my job.	Ngifuna lokhu kube umsebenzi wami.
I do not want to buy now.	Angifuni ukuthenga manje.
It really should.	Ngempela kufanele.
That's his father.	Ubaba wakhe lowo.
You really mean that now.	Impela usho lokho manje.
And it will not be so difficult for us.	Futhi ngeke kube nzima kangako kithi.
Just for fun.	Ukuze nje ujabule.
And my friend.	Futhi umngane wami.
I had to find a doctor.	Kwadingeka ngithole udokotela.
But no one thinks about it.	Kodwa akukho muntu ocabanga ngakho.
There is no need to pretend that it does not.	Asikho isidingo sokwenza sengathi ayikho.
She loves to work.	Uthanda ukusebenza.
You really can't say.	Ngempela awukwazi ukusho.
I didn't really know.	Ngangingazi ngempela.
I don't like him.	Angithandi kuye.
No restraint, now.	Akukho ukuzibamba, manje.
I wanted to keep going.	Ngangifuna ukuqhubeka nakho.
He certainly would not.	Ngempela wayengeke.
I like everything about this.	Ngithanda yonke into ngalokhu.
People time.	Abantu isikhathi.
Now that.	Manje ukuthi.
This is not a lie.	Lokhu akuwona amanga.
It’s not about thinking about you, or about him.	Akukhona ukucabanga ngawe, noma kuye.
The boy thought he knew it all.	Umfana wayecabanga ukuthi wazi konke.
He must go as he is.	Kumele ahambe njengoba enjalo.
Still the same problem.	Namanje inkinga efanayo.
I want to take a dog.	Ngifuna ukuthatha inja.
He never did.	Akakaze enze.
You look busy.	Ubukeka umatasa.
We have to be someone else.	Kufanele sibe omunye umuntu.
I'm thinking of getting back there.	Ngicabanga ukubuyela lapho.
It just can't be done openly.	Ngeke nje kwenziwe ngokusobala.
But he probably will not.	Kodwa cishe ngeke akwazi.
Not to work, not to sleep.	Hhayi ukusebenza, hhayi ukulala.
Who are you? 	Ubani wena?
Because it is difficult.	Ngoba kunzima.
And wait.	Futhi ukulinda .
Anything he can't do.	Noma yini angeke ayenze.
That is not my opinion.	Akuwona umbono wami lowo.
Maybe that's what he is.	Mhlawumbe yilokho ayikho.
You can't say who he is.	Angeke usho ukuthi ubani.
That is not my way.	Akuyona indlela yami leyo.
He is definitely coming.	Impela uyeza.
Obviously yes.	Kusobala ukuthi yebo.
Rather a long time.	Kunalokho isikhathi eside.
What and where you live.	Yini futhi uhlala kuphi.
He wanted to get things right as soon as possible.	Wayefuna ukulungisa izinto ngokushesha ngangokunokwenzeka.
I think you do not know.	Ngicabanga ukuthi awazi.
It should not be now.	Akufanele manje.
He did not want to see it.	Wayengafuni ukubona.
Nobody wants to be here.	Akekho ofuna ukuba lapha.
There is no other place.	Ayikho enye indawo.
All is well.	Konke kulungile impela.
I need to cry.	Ngidinga ukukhala.
To be that.	Ukuze kube lokho.
Working with it still.	Ukusebenza ngakho namanje.
And no food, either.	Futhi akukho ukudla, noma.
He went home.	Ahambe aye ekhaya.
It's his thing.	Yinto yakhe.
It should be great !.	Kufanele kube kuhle!.
He would not know what was happening to him.	Wayengeke azi ukuthi kwenzekani kuye.
He can't be.	Angeke abe njalo.
Probably not now.	Mhlawumbe akunjalo manje.
We need to do better.	Sidinga ukwenza kangcono.
I wonder what you think of me.	Kazi ucabanga ngami.
I thought this would be great.	Bengicabanga ukuthi lokhu kuzoba kuhle.
Really, you are the reason.	Ngempela, nguwe isizathu.
That means nothing to us.	Lokho akusho lutho kithi.
And not just now, but always.	Futhi hhayi nje manje, kodwa njalo.
You and your family.	Wena kanye nomndeni wakho.
But he is your person.	Kodwa ungumuntu wakho.
This should not be too necessary.	Lokhu kufanele kungadingeki kakhulu.
For some work.	Ngomsebenzi othile.
You are better here with us.	Ungcono lapha nathi.
This is not really about him.	Lokhu akukhona ngempela ngaye.
I think you know.	Ngicabanga uyazi.
He could not make a mistake.	Wayengeke enze iphutha.
Either driving to work or riding your bike.	Noma ukushayela ukuya emsebenzini noma ukugibela ibhayisikili lakho.
And yes, that is true.	Futhi yebo, lokho kuyiqiniso.
Definitely very soon.	Nakanjani ngokushesha kakhulu.
Of course he will not be able to stay.	Yebo ngeke akwazi ukuhlala.
All of this is good and good.	Konke lokhu kuhle futhi kuhle.
And no, by the way.	Futhi cha, ngendlela.
But only if her mother is not there.	Kodwa kuphela uma umama wakhe engekho.
This is your father.	Ubaba wakho lo.
No, not him.	Cha, hhayi yena.
More on that later.	Okuningi kulokho kamuva.
I say that in the best way.	Ngisho lokho ngendlela engcono kakhulu.
But he did not know what it was.	Kodwa wayengazi ukuthi yini.
If you want to go, you have to do it.	Uma ufuna ukuhamba, kufanele wenze njalo.
Ikati.	Ikati .
You know, you just say things.	Uyazi, ukhuluma nje izinto.
Really because of doing so.	Ngempela ngenxa yokwenza kanjalo.
Still, he wanted to know more.	Noma kunjalo, wayefuna ukwazi okwengeziwe.
This is done by you.	Lokhu kwenziwe nguwe.
And maybe even.	Futhi mhlawumbe ngisho .
Probably a problem.	Cishe leyo nkinga.
He stayed in the house.	Wahlala endlini.
Looks like you did too.	Kubukeka sengathi nawe wenza njalo.
I do not want to go back to the city.	Angifuni ukubuyela edolobheni.
He has no way.	Akanayo indlela.
He probably couldn't.	Cishe akakwazanga.
Stupid, he thought.	Isilima, wacabanga.
I would love your help, too.	Ngingathanda usizo lwakho, nami.
But this is not entirely true.	Kodwa lokhu akulona iqiniso ngokuphelele.
Yes, this is happening.	Yebo, lokhu kwenzeka.
He did not really want to leave.	Wayengafuni ngempela ukuhamba.
It can be very dangerous !.	Kungaba ingozi enkulu!.
That he could be with me.	Ukuthi angaba nami.
I thought about it almost every day.	Ngangicabanga ngakho cishe nsuku zonke.
To know.	Ukuze ukwazi.
He did not know why he had come here.	Wayengazi ukuthi kungani eze lapha.
But this is it.	Kodwa lena .
And this is my problem now.	Futhi lena inkinga yami manje.
She can be really beautiful.	Angaba muhle ngempela.
I could not come.	angikwazanga ukuza.
He did that to me.	Wenza lokho kimi.
And he says that.	Futhi usho lokho.
So, you.	Ngakho, nawe.
Or, at least, a very nice place.	Noma, okungenani, indawo enhle kakhulu.
You may also eat something.	Kungenzeka futhi udle okuthile.
I will be with him soon.	Ngizoba naye maduze.
He made a great point.	Wenza umqondo omkhulu.
You will do well here.	Uzokwenza kahle lapha.
I thought a lot about it.	Ngicabange kakhulu ngakho.
I don't see how I can do that.	Angiboni ukuthi ngingakwenza kanjani lokho.
I don't understand why that would happen.	Angiqondi ukuthi kungani lokho kuzokwenzeka.
But in your house.	Kodwa endlini yakho.
Nothing about us.	Akukho ngathi.
I know better.	Ngiyazi kahle.
He was amazed at who she was.	Wamangala impela ukuthi ubani.
It does not mean a good idea.	Akusho ukuthi umqondo omuhle.
No, she is beautiful.	Cha, muhle.
He wanted to say no, you know.	Wayefuna ukuthi cha, uyazi.
It will be a little difficult this weekend.	Kuzoba nzima kancane ngempelasonto.
He wanted to know everything about us.	Wayefuna ukwazi yonke into ngathi.
Sounds like it will happen.	Kuzwakala kuzokwenzeka.
And not the wind.	Futhi hhayi umoya.
He just wanted to get some sleep.	Wayefuna nje ukulala kancane.
Tell me everything.	Ngitshele ngakho konke.
Not really, but it should be.	Hhayi ngempela, kodwa kufanele kube.
And again, no.	Futhi futhi, cha.
I thought she was really beautiful.	Bengicabanga ukuthi muhle ngempela.
I want you to say.	Ngifuna usho.
His voice.	Izwi lakhe .
This sounds a little off.	Lokhu kuzwakala kancane.
Yes, my father would not be here.	Yebo ubaba ngabe akekho.
Now, nothing happens.	Manje, akukho okwenzekayo.
But I actually know that is not the case.	Kodwa empeleni ngiyazi ukuthi akunjalo.
But you seem to want to take more.	Kodwa ubonakala sengathi ufuna ukuthatha okwengeziwe.
The way to go is just to do.	Indlela eya kukho ukwenza nje.
Maybe not my way.	Mhlawumbe ayikho indlela yami.
First to me.	Okokuqala kimi.
I need you not to be here right now.	Ngidinga ukuthi ungabi lapha njengamanje.
I would love to do this with you.	Ngithanda ukwenza lokhu nawe.
He could have really been her.	Ngabe nguye ngempela .
He knew how it happened.	Wayazi ukuthi kwenzeke kanjani.
So stop.	Ngakho yeka.
I'm sorry you're here with me.	Ngiyaxolisa ulapha nami.
It's hard and you know.	Kunzima futhi uyazi.
But he just couldn't do it.	Kodwa akakwazanga nje ukukwenza.
I knew it wasn't my fault.	Bengazi ukuthi akulona iphutha lami.
Not really, of course.	Cha ngempela, kunjalo.
You really feel about this story.	Uzizwa ngempela ngale ndaba.
You will not find anything.	Ngeke uthole lutho.
That is not a marriage.	Akuwona umshado lowo.
I need to stay.	Ngidinga ukuhlala.
Unless something bad happens, it is.	Ngaphandle uma kwenzeka into embi, kunjalo.
There, at the door.	Lapho, emnyango.
Someone came to my school.	Omunye weza esikoleni sami.
Or always.	Noma ngaso sonke isikhathi.
First, this is not true.	Okokuqala, lokhu akulona iqiniso.
We need water.	Sidinga amanzi.
I’m sure you know what you think.	Nginesiqiniseko sokuthi uyazi ukuthi ucabanga kanjani.
And it really isn't necessary.	Futhi empeleni akudingekile.
Maybe not right now, maybe you never did.	Mhlawumbe hhayi njengamanje, mhlawumbe awukaze ukwenze.
I am not someone else.	Angiyena omunye umuntu.
I just didn’t know it at the time.	Ngangingazi nje ngaleso sikhathi.
That’s why we need to go.	Yingakho sidinga ukuhamba.
Not a big cat or dog.	Akulona ikati elikhulu noma inja.
And he can.	Futhi angakwazi.
I need your car.	Ngidinga imoto yakho.
That is likely to happen.	Lokho cishe kuzokwenzeka.
Alone alone.	Eyedwa yedwa.
Later, much later, in the car.	Kamuva, kamuva kakhulu, emotweni.
Maybe later in the car.	Mhlawumbe kamuva emotweni.
And it's not the same thing.	Futhi akuyona into efanayo.
I will not go to him.	Ngeke ngiye kuye.
It just happened there.	Kwenzeka nje lapho.
He was able to help my children get out.	Wakwazi ukusiza izingane zami ukuphuma.
But we can't sleep at all.	Kodwa asikwazi nhlobo ukulala.
There is probably a better way to do it.	Cishe kukhona indlela engcono yokwenza.
But he could not move.	Kodwa akakwazanga ukuhamba.
Thanks for what happened.	Ngiyabonga okwenzekile.
Everyone at work.	Wonke umuntu emsebenzini.
How cute.	Kuhle kangakanani.
But he often did.	Kodwa wayevame ukuba njalo.
But he could not continue.	Kodwa akakwazanga ukuqhubeka.
Not a very good job, but good enough.	Akuwona umsebenzi omuhle kakhulu, kodwa omuhle ngokwanele.
Here, for you.	Lapha, ngawe.
It all happened perfectly.	Konke kwenzeke ngokuphelele.
This he could not do.	Lokhu wayengeke akwazi ukukwenza.
So it will take a while.	Ngakho kuzothatha isikhashana.
We found out that it is not.	Sithole ukuthi akunjalo.
This is just one thing.	Yinto eyodwa nje lena.
For a moment he looked up.	Isikhashana wabheka phezulu.
What a day.	Yeka usuku.
I thought it was going to be the way.	Bengicabanga ukuthi kuzoba indlela.
It will be really you.	Uzoba nguwe ngempela.
This, it seems, is hard to do.	Lokhu, kubonakala, kunzima ukukwenza.
And people, too, are right.	Futhi abantu, futhi, kunjalo.
I need to know if it is possible.	Ngidinga ukwazi ukuthi kungenzeka yini.
I would never know that.	Bengingeke ngikwazi lokho.
I will not speak.	Ngeke ngize ngikhulume.
I thought, there is a place to go.	Ngacabanga, kukhona indawo eya endaweni.
No one else wants this.	Akekho omunye ofuna lokhu.
Not time.	Hhayi isikhathi.
Where you live.	Uhlala kuphi.
The view is excellent.	Umbono muhle kakhulu.
I really want to hear this.	Ngifuna ngempela ukuzwa lokhu.
He is not really a person.	Akayena ngempela umuntu.
Feeling the pain.	Ukuzwa ubuhlungu.
Next to me.	Eduze kwami.
Maybe not for you.	Mhlawumbe hhayi kuwe.
I can't say when that will happen.	Angikwazi ukusho ukuthi kuzokwenzeka nini lokho.
Because you are not.	Ngoba akekho wena.
He became difficult.	Waba nzima.
I could not get his advice.	Angikwazanga ukuthola iseluleko sakhe.
It will not, of course.	Ngeke, kunjalo.
You really can't.	Ngempela awukwazi.
You can't find your answer there.	Awukwazi ukuthola impendulo yakho lapho.
Almost everything, it seems.	Cishe konke, kubonakala.
He also did not think.	Naye akazange acabange.
Or really trying to do something here.	Noma ngempela uzama ukwenzani lapha.
I'm happy with the way it happened.	Ngijabule ngendlela okwenzeka ngayo.
I'd better talk to her myself.	Kungcono ngikhulume naye mina.
In this case, very efficient.	Kulokhu, ukusebenza kahle kakhulu.
Now it is possible.	Manje kungenzeka.
I can't wait any longer.	Angisakwazi ukulinda kodwa.
I go there myself.	Ngiya lapho mina.
It is not just food.	Akukhona nje ukudla.
I never told people about it.	Angikaze ngitshele abantu ngakho.
I should have talked to you about it.	Bekufanele ngikhulume nawe ngakho.
At home all day.	Ekhaya usuku lonke.
I like traveling.	Ngithanda ukuhamba.
No one else does this.	Akekho omunye owenza lokhu.
Health risk.	Ingozi impilo.
He did not want to do that.	Wayengafuni enze lokho.
One a few weeks.	Omunye amasonto ambalwa.
But, you are also human.	Kodwa, nawe ungumuntu.
He said he didn't have it.	Wathi akanayo.
Almost everyone in the world knows that now.	Cishe wonke umuntu emhlabeni uyakwazi lokho manje.
He wanted me to be able to quit.	Wayefuna ngikwazi ukuyeka.
And not before.	Futhi hhayi ngaphambili.
He couldn't really control himself.	Akakwazanga ngempela ukuzibamba.
He did three years ago and he does now.	Wenza eminyakeni emithathu edlule futhi wenza manje.
Great danger.	Ingozi enkulu.
He doesn't even know what it is.	Akazi nokuthi yini.
Looks like that.	Kubukeka sengathi kunjalo.
So maybe he would be there too.	Ngakho mhlawumbe wayezoba lapho futhi.
He too seemed a little out of place.	Naye wayebonakala kancane kancane.
My whole life.	Impilo yami yonke .
I don't understand how anyone could do that.	Angiqondi ukuthi umuntu angakwenza kanjani lokho.
I don't want to sing in the house.	Angifuni ukucula endlini.
That's a lot of stay.	Lokho ukuhlala okuningi.
But still he came.	Kodwa noma kunjalo wafika.
Thank you for that.	Ngiyabonga yilokho kuphela.
I do not want to eat anything.	Angifuni ukudla lutho.
And there is no right place.	Futhi akukho ndawo efanele.
Now the only problem is logging in.	Manje inkinga nje ukungena.
He will not, never will.	Angeke, akasoze.
He looked his age.	Wayebukeka iminyaka yakhe.
I want nothing from you.	Angifuni lutho kuwe.
I think you should buy one too.	Ngicabanga ukuthi nawe kufanele uthenge eyodwa.
I will not stay here again.	Ngeke futhi ngihlale lapha.
His name alone.	Igama lakhe kuphela.
I didn’t think much about it at first.	Angizange ngicabange okuningi ngakho ekuqaleni.
I wanted to be up there.	Ngangifuna ukuba lapho phezulu.
Yes, everyone knows that.	Yebo, wonke umuntu uyakwazi lokho.
That is my hope.	Ithemba lami lelo.
It is not that we want to fix everything.	Akukhona ukuthi sifuna ukulungisa yonke into.
That sounds a little off.	Lokho kuzwakala kancane.
He was absent for months.	Wahlala izinyanga engekho.
I will not see anyone.	Ngeke ngibone muntu.
I do some work once.	Ngenza umsebenzi othile kanye.
But little by little over time.	Kodwa kancane kancane ngesikhathi.
Needless to say, it would be great.	Akudingeki ukusho, kungaba okukhulu.
She is just happy and determined now.	Ujabule nje futhi uzimisele manje.
Not a bad idea at all.	Akuwona umqondo omubi ngokuphelele.
He could not decide what to do with it.	Akakwazanga ukwenza isinqumo ngakho.
It has to happen now.	Kumele kwenzeke manje.
be that still.	kube lokho namanje.
That is not a little true today.	Lokho akulona iqiniso kancane namuhla.
No, not even that.	Cha, ngisho nalokho.
And you will need dinner too.	Futhi uzodinga isidlo sakusihlwa futhi.
It will happen many times.	Kuzokwenzeka izikhathi eziningi.
He did everything else.	Wenze konke okunye.
But he finally agreed.	Kodwa ekugcineni wavuma.
And you will not know.	Futhi ngeke ukwazi.
You do not need to know the way.	Awudingi ukwazi indlela.
Because everyone is beautiful.	Ngoba wonke umuntu muhle.
Everyone here wants me to do well.	Wonke umuntu lapha ufuna ngenze kahle.
He will have to think of something else.	Kuzofanele acabange okunye.
Such a beautiful room.	Igumbi elihle kangaka.
He could not speak a sound.	Akakwazanga ukukhuluma umsindo.
Also, a lot of money.	Futhi, imali eningi.
But also a little.	Kodwa futhi kancane.
That's my place.	Indawo yami leyo.
My father did not do that.	Ubaba akakwenzanga lokho.
The boy needs his father close by.	Umfana udinga ubaba wakhe eduze.
I can no longer do anything, I do not want to do anything else.	angisakwazi ukwenza okunye, angifuni ukwenza okunye.
You should at least do what you need to do.	Kufanele okungenani wenze lokho okudingeka ukwenze.
Not just any dog.	Hhayi nje noma iyiphi inja.
So many say.	Ngakho abaningi bathi.
Slowly, though.	Kancane, noma kunjalo.
You once did something well.	Wake wenza okuthile kahle.
Good if you need advice.	Muhle uma udinga iseluleko.
I can't find the key yet.	Angikwazi ukuthola ukhiye okwamanje.
So bad !.	Okubi kangaka!.
Or good, really.	Noma kuhle, ngempela.
Months, actually.	Izinyanga, empeleni.
So he sat down and thought.	Ngakho wahlala phansi wacabanga.
It all starts immediately.	Konke kuqala ngokushesha.
Maybe a few times.	Mhlawumbe izikhathi ezimbalwa.
That can be a big problem.	Lokho kungase kube inkinga enkulu.
This is not the first time this has happened.	Akukhona okokuqala lokhu kwenzeka.
I probably know as much about you as you know.	Cishe ngazi okuningi ngawe njengoba wazi.
Stop doing it all.	Yeka ukwenza konke.
Maybe then.	Mhlawumbe ngaleso sikhathi.
He may do well.	Angase enze kahle.
Time to make a decision.	Isikhathi sokwenza isinqumo.
He walked slowly.	Uhambe kancane.
Most of the time we do well with it.	Isikhathi esiningi senza kahle ngakho.
From the answer yes you too.	Kusukela impendulo yebo nawe.
Everyone looked at him.	Wonke umuntu wabheka kuye.
He tried to do things on his own.	Wazama ukwenza izinto eyedwa.
And yes all of this really happened.	Futhi yebo konke lokhu kwenzeka ngempela.
Hard, but not overly so.	Kunzima, kodwa hhayi ngokweqile.
He said he really needed to talk to me.	Wathi udinga ngempela ukukhuluma nami.
He would like to be the only dog.	Angathanda ukuba yedwa inja.
It just had to.	Kwakufanele nje.
He knew he wouldn't be in your midst.	Wayazi ukuthi wayengeke abe phakathi kwakho.
This should not be the case.	Lokhu akumele kube njalo.
Everyone thinks she is beautiful.	Wonke umuntu ucabanga ukuthi muhle.
All the time, nothing.	Ngaso sonke isikhathi, akukho lutho.
He tried to hear nothing.	Wazama ukuzwa lutho.
Tom also looked better obviously.	UTom naye wayebukeka engcono ngokusobala.
But you will need a name.	Kodwa uzodinga igama.
There is something to be done, of course.	Kukhona okumele kwenziwe, kunjalo.
No child is missing.	Ayikho ingane engekho.
No one has to tell me.	Akekho okumele angitshele.
The rest did not happen.	Okunye akuzange kwenzeke.
I thought it should.	Bengicabanga ukuthi kufanele.
Not just once.	Hhayi kanye nje.
The only problem is how.	Inkinga kuphela ukuthi kanjani.
They say you should buy one.	Bathi kufanele uthenge eyodwa.
He will be back again soon.	Uzobuya futhi maduze.
The boy is very talented.	Umfana unekhono kakhulu.
He could not walk easily.	Wayengeke ahambe kalula.
Thank you thank you !!!.	Ngiyabonga ngiyabonga!!!.
We have to do that again.	Kufanele sikwenze lokho futhi.
Not a gun.	Hhayi isibhamu.
I have to know that.	Kumele ngikwazi lokho.
But it is not easy.	Kodwa akukho lula.
It should not be so difficult.	Akumele kube nzima kangako.
But he came with me.	Kodwa weza nami.
I could not get here fast enough.	Angikwazanga ukufika lapha ngokushesha ngokwanele.
And yes, he did as he went.	Futhi yebo, wakwenza njengoba ehamba.
And she is beautiful too.	Futhi muhle futhi.
I thought about it a lot.	Ngacabanga ngakho kakhulu.
You can feel the wind, you will do it again tomorrow.	Uyakwazi ukuzwa umoya, uzokwenza futhi kusasa.
I think he is not that bad.	Ngicabanga ukuthi akayena umuntu omubi kangako.
That is not the whole story.	Akuyona indaba yonke.
Stop your job.	Yeka umsebenzi wakho.
He soon found something.	Ngokushesha wathola okuthile.
I just can't sit still.	Angikwazi ukuhlala nje.
It is always difficult.	Kunzima njalo.
Yes you will.	Yebo uzofika.
It could happen at any time.	Kungenzeka noma nini.
And what it looks like is not up to you.	Futhi ukuthi kubonakala kanjani akukho kuwe.
Very bad news.	Indaba embi kakhulu.
But that was not necessary.	Kodwa lokho kwakungadingeki.
No problem at all.	Ayikho inkinga nhlobo.
He will always return.	Uzobuya njalo.
He agreed to that.	Wavuma lokho.
I'm happy about it, really.	Ngiyajabula ngakho, ngempela.
I want to be a friend.	Ngifuna ukuba umngane.
I think it's always good.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kuhle ngaso sonke isikhathi.
It's the right thing to do.	Yinto efanele impela ukuyenza.
Not sleep, really.	Hhayi ukulala, ngempela.
You should find strength in this.	Kufanele uthole amandla kulokhu.
And it is not his fault.	Futhi akulona iphutha lakhe.
He tried some.	Wazama ezinye.
It had to be a car.	Kwakufanele kube imoto.
We must do that immediately.	Kufanele sikwenze ngokushesha lokho.
If anything is too bad.	Uma kukhona okubi kakhulu.
You just can't do such a thing on top.	Awukwazi nje ukwenza into enjalo phezulu.
He really is like us.	Ufana nathi ngempela.
I know that.	Ngiyazi lokho.
I need you here.	Ngidinga wena lapha.
Now we both know why.	Manje sobabili siyazi ukuthi kungani.
This he will not try.	Lokhu angeke azame.
You can't imagine.	Awukwazi ukucabanga .
It could be a few weeks.	Kungenzeka kube amasonto ambalwa.
Very bad place.	Indawo embi kakhulu.
Glad to see it finally happen.	Ngiyajabula ukukubona ekugcineni kwenzeka.
Finally the door gave up.	Ekugcineni umnyango wanikeza.
But not just that.	Kodwa hhayi lokho nje.
But this is not a problem for us.	Kodwa lokhu akuyona inkinga kithi.
I heard about him just once.	Ngezwa ngaye kanye nje.
He will be really alone.	Uzobe eyedwa ngempela.
But even this is not really true.	Kodwa ngisho nalokhu akulona iqiniso ngempela.
This could be high.	Lokhu kungaba phezulu.
I have not waited yet.	Angikaze ngilinde okwamanje.
At least he said his name.	Okungenani wathi igama lakhe.
We need to be much better.	Kudingeka sibe ngcono kakhulu.
Now it will take years.	Manje kuzothatha iminyaka.
He just loves to find his way.	Uthanda nje ukuthola indlela yakhe.
I know what it looks like.	Ngiyazi ukuthi kubukeka kanjani.
All but you, of course.	Konke ngaphandle kwakho, kunjalo.
He saw everything.	Wabona konke.
I don’t think he can take a bad picture.	Angicabangi ukuthi angakwazi ukuthatha isithombe esibi.
I would love to be a teacher in your classroom.	Ngingathanda ukuba uthisha ekilasini lakho.
Party every night.	Iphathi njalo ebusuku.
Probably a bad idea.	Mhlawumbe umqondo omubi.
I know, everybody says that.	Ngiyazi, wonke umuntu usho lokho.
My mother knows nothing about it.	Umama akazi lutho ngakho.
I have to tell you.	Kufanele ngikutshele.
I think you are much better.	Ngicabanga ukuthi ungcono kakhulu.
I never told anyone or talked about it.	Angizange ngitshele muntu noma ngikhulume ngakho.
Getting into trouble.	Ukungena enkingeni.
I'm not, now.	Angiyena, manje.
Even if you are here.	Noma ngabe ulapha.
I want to choose from everything.	Ngifuna ukukhetha kukho konke.
Anyway, go.	Noma kunjalo, uhambe.
I do not know the reason why.	Angikwazi isizathu sokuthi kungani.
But we know he is not.	Kodwa siyazi ukuthi akayena.
But about him.	Kodwa ngaye.
He was just too scared.	Wavele wesaba kakhulu.
This he probably did.	Lokhu kungenzeka ukuthi wakwenza.
That would be his opinion.	Lokho kungaba umbono wakhe.
Tell me, do you.	Ngitshele, ingabe .
But we have to do something.	Kodwa kufanele senze okuthile.
I have seen it many times.	Ngibone kaningi.
Or I just can't.	Noma angikwazi nje.
Everyone is happy except you.	Wonke umuntu ujabule ngaphandle kwakho.
But there is more there, too.	Kodwa kukhona okunye lapho, futhi.
No, not a word.	Cha, hhayi izwi.
He got into bed with her.	Wangena naye embhedeni.
I did nothing.	Angizange ngenze lutho.
But you have to do something.	Kodwa kufanele wenze okuthile.
Maybe he's not here.	Mhlawumbe akekho lapha.
I do it alone.	Ngenza ngedwa.
Maybe he took one.	Mhlawumbe wathatha eyodwa.
Not everyone, you know.	Akuwona wonke umuntu, uyazi.
You never really thought about me.	Awukaze ucabange ngami ngempela.
You talk about it.	Ukhuluma ngakho.
He would like to.	Angathanda.
Not always a bad thing.	Akuyona into embi njalo.
He didn't know what it was, and he didn't know why.	Wayengazi ukuthi yini, futhi wayengazi ukuthi kungani.
He said nothing at all.	Akazange asho lutho nakancane.
You have to be on top.	Kufanele ube phezulu.
Just here for convenience.	Lapha nje ukuze kube lula.
It should, obviously.	Kufanele, ngokusobala.
I just want to talk to him.	Ngifuna nje ukukhuluma naye.
Help me find the truth.	Ngisize ngithole iqiniso.
He agreed to go with me.	Wavuma ukuhamba nami.
Life can be better.	Ukuphila kungaba ngcono.
A lot, obviously.	Kuningi, ngokusobala.
Everything is fine there.	Konke kuhle lapho.
Everything can be very simple.	Konke kungaba lula kakhulu.
This may be better for you, however.	Lokhu kungaba ngcono kuwe, noma kunjalo.
I could not wait to leave.	Angikwazanga ukulinda ukuhamba.
I want to be with him.	Ngifuna ukuba naye.
Now, tell me this.	Manje, ngitshele lokhu.
From then on, the marriage declined.	Kusukela lapho, umshado wenqaba.
And death.	Futhi ukufa.
But good about that.	Kodwa kuhle ngalokho.
You must stay in hospital all day.	Kumele uhlale usuku lonke esibhedlela.
Everything is bad.	Yonke into embi.
If you don't, you really should.	Uma ungakwenzi, kufanele ngempela.
You know nothing '.	Awazi lutho'.
And sometimes his friends.	Futhi ngezinye izikhathi abangane bakhe.
He wants to go with you when you go to school.	Ufuna ukuhamba nawe uma uya esikoleni.
It will not be easy.	Ngeke kwenzeke kalula.
But, it can also be difficult.	Kodwa, kungase futhi kube nzima.
Slow movement.	Ukuhamba kancane kancane.
And so that's what happened.	Futhi ngakho yilokho okwenzekayo.
I mean, who else.	Ngisho, ubani omunye.
Not really, he says.	Akunjalo ngempela, uthi.
How all of this happened.	Yeka indlela okwenzeka ngayo konke lokhu.
I can no longer wait for him to read.	Angisakwazi ukulinda ukuthi afunde.
It will be difficult and will take time.	Kuzoba nzima futhi kuzothatha isikhathi.
I know you will do a good job with it.	Ngiyazi ukuthi uzokwenza umsebenzi omuhle ngayo.
No, time.	Akunjalo, isikhathi.
And he does not know why.	Futhi akazi ukuthi kungani.
I suspect it is not.	Ngisola ukuthi akunjalo.
But not me, thank you.	Kodwa hhayi mina, ngiyabonga.
Thirty years ago, almost to this day.	Eminyakeni engamashumi amathathu edlule, cishe kuze kube namuhla.
Maybe this will be much better.	Mhlawumbe lokhu kuzoba ngcono kakhulu.
Living by it.	Ukuphila ngakho.
We do that in everything.	Senza lokho kukho konke.
And he never did that.	Futhi akazange akwenze lokho.
That happened.	Lokho kwenzeka.
Because he said.	Ngoba wathi .
My mother knew, too.	Umama wayazi, naye.
And most of the time that's perfectly fine.	Futhi isikhathi esiningi lokho kuhle ngokuphelele.
He did it, very good.	Wakwenza, kuhle kakhulu.
Are you ?.	Ingabe nawe?.
The question is.	Umbuzo uthini.
It happened so fast.	Kwenzeke ngokushesha.
Nothing.	Ayikho into.
He took it, quickly.	Wathatha kukho, ngokushesha.
I hope that is right for you.	Ngethemba ukuthi lokho kulungile kuwe.
And it will not.	Futhi ngeke neze.
He suffered pain at an early age.	Wezwa ubuhlungu esemncane.
But he could not do that alone.	Kodwa wayengeke akwazi ukwenza lokhu eyedwa.
Someone is here.	Omunye ulapha.
Only the father.	Ubaba kuphela.
Months now.	Izinyanga manje.
I know he can do it.	Ngiyazi angakwenza.
You should have expected.	Bekufanele ngabe ulindele.
For us, one.	Kithi, omunye.
But no down.	Kodwa akukho phansi.
Sometimes it can be very high.	Ngezinye izikhathi kungaba phezulu kakhulu.
Only when you speak.	Kuphela uma ukhuluma.
It had to be hard.	Kwakufanele kube nzima.
That is not a job.	Lokho akuwona umsebenzi.
And thank you '.	Futhi ngiyabonga'.
That anyone else can be.	Ukuthi noma ubani omunye angaba.
Not a good question.	Hhayi kahle umbuzo.
He decided to go with her.	Wanquma ukuhamba naye.
So it can be your story.	Ngakho kungaba indaba yakho.
And you can see when someone does that.	Futhi uyakwazi ukubona lapho umuntu enza lokho.
This is so for me.	Lokhu kunjalo kimi.
We need that down.	Sidinga lokho phansi.
There is nothing wrong with that but not with me.	Akukho okubi ngakho kodwa hhayi kimi.
They are dead.	Washona.
I couldn’t, not for long.	Angikwazanga, hhayi isikhathi eside.
Done from the beginning.	Kwenziwe kusukela ekuqaleni.
It’s hard to find fault with it, really.	Kunzima ukuthola iphutha kukho, ngempela.
Hopefully, it will not be necessary.	Ngethemba, ngeke kudingeke.
I saw fit.	Ngabona kufanele.
He sat in his car.	Wahlala emotweni yakhe.
He did not say this out loud.	Akazange akhulume lokhu phezulu.
Probably not.	Mhlawumbe ngeke kube khona.
This does not have to be long.	Lokhu akudingekile ukuba kube isikhathi eside.
The mother does not know.	Umama akazi.
Absolutely, no.	Nakanjani, akekho.
He may do as he pleases.	Angase enze lokho angathanda ngakho.
He will have to know in the end.	Kuzofanele azi ekugcineni.
Anyone at all.	Noma ubani nhlobo.
I won't even go there.	Ngeke ngisho ngiye lapho.
My father never did.	Ubaba akakaze.
He is coming with us.	Uyeza nathi.
Not a very good team.	Akulona iqembu elihle kakhulu.
He's trying to see you.	Uzama ukukubona.
And again, there is no right answer.	Futhi futhi, ayikho impendulo efanele.
Actually not at home.	Empeleni hhayi ekhaya.
Just fast enough.	Ngokushesha nje ngokwanele.
About my age.	Cishe iminyaka yami.
Very, very bad.	Kakhulu, kabi kakhulu.
At least nowhere near.	Okungenani akukho ndawo eduze.
Sounds hard, but it will get better.	Kuzwakala kunzima, kodwa kuzoba ngcono.
We never had that.	Asizange sibe nakho lokho.
I had to be happy again.	Kwadingeka ngijabule futhi.
And sometimes, yes, that's right.	Futhi ngezinye izikhathi, yebo, kunjalo.
I need to go to the hospital.	Ngidinga ukuya esibhedlela.
Tell me yes.	Ngitshele yebo.
I can't wait for that.	Angikwazi ukulinda leyo.
He will do it my way.	Uzokwenza ngendlela yami.
And this is not what it really means.	Futhi lokhu akukhona okushiwo lokho empeleni.
Me, his mother.	Mina, umama wakhe.
I would love to work with you.	Ngingathanda ukusebenza nawe.
You never came and you never left.	Awukaze ufike futhi awuzange uhambe.
Or, at least, you feel this later.	Noma, okungenani, uzizwa lokhu kamuva.
I have to go to work.	Kufanele ngiye emsebenzini.
Please, just once.	Ngicela, kube kanye nje.
If you do, you will not be alone.	Uma wenza kanjalo, ngeke ube wedwa.
This is a serious problem.	Lena inkinga embi.
He didn't have to say anything else.	Kwakungadingeki akhulume okunye.
It can't be done right.	Ngeke kwenziwe kahle.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Ngicela ungitshele ukuthi ngenze kanjani.
I feel very bad.	Ngizizwa kabi kakhulu.
I have to do it.	Kufanele ngenze.
He says he doesn't know, so he doesn't know.	Uthi akazi, ngakho akazi.
Not such a bad life.	Hhayi impilo embi kanje.
Not to me or anyone else.	Hhayi kimi noma omunye umuntu.
And the truth.	Futhi iqiniso.
I know it is possible.	Ngiyazi kungenzeka.
And that's really hard to get out of here.	Futhi lokho kunzima ngempela ukuphuma lapha.
Someone came to me.	Omunye weza kimi.
You should stay and eat with me.	Kufanele uhlale futhi udle nami.
I didn’t want to get in anyway.	Ngangingafuni ukungena noma kunjalo.
And once again.	Futhi kanye futhi.
He goes down.	Uya phansi.
He could not really get into trouble.	Akakwazanga ngempela ukungena enkingeni.
But that did not happen.	Kodwa lokho akuzange kwenzeke.
Sit on the bed.	Ahlale embhedeni.
I think we can't do it.	Ngicabanga ukuthi ngeke sikwenze.
You say so too.	Nawe usho njalo.
Me and you, as you say.	Mina nawe, njengoba usho.
Unless it is, it does not exist.	Ngaphandle uma kunjalo, ayikho.
It will not help.	Ngeke kube usizo.
A book? 	Incwadi?
You need to get married.	Udinga ukushada.
She walked away happy.	Wahamba ejabule.
I can't afford that at all.	Angikwazi nhlobo ukuthenga lokho.
Thank you for such a wonderful job.	Ngiyabonga ngomsebenzi omuhle kangaka.
Now let me talk to her.	Manje ake ngikhulume naye.
Much more needs to be done.	Kuningi okwengeziwe okudingeka kwenziwe.
Good job, everyone !.	Umsebenzi omuhle, wonke umuntu!.
I should not have come here.	Bekungafanele ngize lapha.
We should too.	Nathi kufanele futhi.
You should tell.	Kufanele utshele.
Because you should be happy now.	Ngoba kufanele ujabule manje.
There is no way out.	Ayikho indlela engekho.
This place, even.	Le ndawo, ngisho.
I need a job.	Ngidinga umsebenzi.
Very good idea too.	Umbono omuhle kakhulu futhi.
We already know that.	Siyazi kakade lokho.
You can't be here.	Awukwazi ukuba lapha.
Anyone who knows.	Noma ubani owaziyo.
I thought there was.	Bengicabanga ukuthi kukhona.
I couldn't make up your mind.	Angikwazanga ukwenza umqondo wakho.
It is not necessary, but it is.	Akudingekile, kodwa kunjalo.
But how is this possible.	Kodwa kungenzeka kanjani lokhu.
Too bad he doesn't know what to do.	Okubi kakhulu akazi ukuthi enzeni.
I can't go to work.	Angikwazi ukuya emsebenzini.
It seems rather.	Kubonakala kunalokho.
But what.	Kodwa yini .
I know it isn't.	Ngiyazi ukuthi akuyena.
He took it and took it.	Wathatha wathatha wathatha.
Good on you !.	Kuhle kuwe!.
He heard some things too.	Wezwa ezinye izinto futhi.
You cannot help one child at a time.	Awukwazi ukusiza ingane eyodwa ngesikhathi.
But you also need to do other things.	Kodwa futhi udinga ukwenza ezinye izinto.
I am not a teacher and I have never been.	Angiyena uthisha futhi angikaze ngibe.
I wanted to tell you.	Bengifuna ukukutshela.
I know what you mean at night.	Ngiyazi ukuthi usho ukuthini ebusuku.
Maybe he didn't really know anything.	Mhlawumbe wayengazi lutho ngempela.
I can't say how long.	Angikwazi ukusho ukuthi kuze kube nini.
It is not a person, or people.	Akuyena umuntu, noma abantu.
In the classroom now.	Ekilasini manje.
It all happened.	Kwenzeka konke.
Really, he should not think this way.	Ngempela, akufanele acabange lokhu.
He knew he was there.	Wayazi ukuthi ukhona.
There is no pretending to be someone else.	Akukho ukuzenza omunye umuntu.
And he got much better.	Futhi waba ngcono kakhulu.
Don't be silly, don't do it outside.	Ungabi isilima, ungakwenzi ngaphandle.
But so far it is good.	Kodwa kuze kube manje kuhle.
I love everything he has done.	Ngithanda konke akwenzile.
I would love to do it again.	Ngingathanda ukukwenza futhi.
He could be.	Angaba .
Music is available.	Umculo ukhona.
All there, he saw.	Konke lapho, wabona.
But there is no need to do that.	Kodwa asikho isidingo sokwenza kanjalo.
It is very clear why.	Kusobala impela ukuthi kungani.
I live alone.	Ngihlala ngedwa.
The boy opened the door.	Umfana wavula umnyango.
We know we should not do that.	Siyazi ukuthi akufanele sikwenze lokho.
Or it could be.	Noma kungaba .
I only do my job.	Ngenza umsebenzi wami kuphela.
Something is happening up there.	Kukhona okwenzekayo phezulu lapho.
But it is something you should know.	Kodwa yinto okufanele uyazi.
Or almost like that.	Noma cishe kanjalo.
We both know that this is not the case.	Sobabili siyazi ukuthi akunjalo.
Your dad wants you to get a job.	Ubaba wakho ufuna uthole umsebenzi.
Or you know someone.	Noma wazi othile.
One book here, another there.	Incwadi eyodwa lapha, enye lapho.
My biggest job.	Umsebenzi wami omkhulu.
There is no other answer.	Ayikho enye impendulo.
I'm not entirely sure how to do this.	Angiqiniseki ngokuphelele ukuthi ngingakwenza kanjani lokhu.
I wish it were tomorrow.	Ngifisa sengathi ngabe kusasa.
You cannot take your money with you.	Awukwazi ukuthatha imali yakho nawe.
Thank you for doing this.	Ngiyabonga ngokwenza lokhu.
And very quickly.	Futhi ngokushesha kakhulu.
And not a waste of money.	Futhi hhayi ukuchitha imali.
You should know about that.	Kufanele wazi ngalokho.
That, right there.	Lowo, khona lapho.
But why? 	Kodwa kungani?
When one left, another took his place.	Lapho omunye ehamba, omunye wathatha indawo yakhe.
I thought it was time.	Bengicabanga ukuthi sekuyisikhathi.
It will be easy for you.	Kuzoba lula kuwe.
Only me, alone.	Mina kuphela, ngedwa.
Now you will know.	Manje uzokwazi.
But that's not me.	Kodwa akumina lowo.
He first came to me.	Waqala weza kimi.
I want to tell you his story.	Ngifuna ukukutshela indaba yakhe.
This time, if you like.	Lesi sikhathi, uma uthanda.
He later returned to work.	Kamuva wabuyela emsebenzini.
He would like to talk.	Angathanda ukukhuluma.
He left just yesterday.	Uhambe izolo nje.
But that will not happen right now.	Kodwa lokho ngeke kwenzeke njengamanje.
That's football.	Ibhola lelo.
And money, of course.	Futhi imali, kunjalo.
We did not find a gun.	Asizange sithole isibhamu.
This is not our fault.	Lokhu akulona icala lethu.
But he came here looking for you.	Kodwa ufike lapha efuna wena.
I can no longer take.	Angisakwazi ukuthatha.
Or at least it should have been.	Noma okungenani bekufanele kube khona.
I apologize early.	Ngiyaxolisa kusenesikhathi.
That's a good idea.	Muhle umbono lowo.
No, not just death.	Cha, hhayi nje ukufa.
Or in danger.	Noma engozini.
So far, there is no answer.	Kuze kube manje, ayikho impendulo.
Up to him.	Kuze kuye .
Very good !!!.	Kuhle kakhulu !!!.
I said nothing about him.	Angizange ngisho lutho ngaye.
I need to tell the truth.	Ngidinga ukukhuluma iqiniso.
Now is the time !.	Manje isikhathi!.
By doing the right thing.	Ngokwenza into efanele.
He had to try harder.	Kwadingeka azame kakhulu.
That's a lot of money.	Imali enkulu leyo.
He knew he had to say something.	Wayazi ukuthi kufanele asho okuthile.
That's his vision.	Lowo umbono wakhe.
He can make it happen.	Angakwenza kwenzeke.
I want to hear this.	Ngifuna ukuzwa lokhu.
It will not be here.	Ngeke kube njalo lapha.
I do not know how this happened.	Angazi ukuthi kwenzeke kanjani lokhu.
All of us here.	Nathi sonke lapha.
He says he would like to go.	Uthi angathanda ukuhamba.
You can also buy books.	Ungakwazi futhi ukuthenga izincwadi.
That would be much easier.	Kungaba lula kakhulu lokho.
But, he did not do this.	Kodwa, akakwenzanga lokhu.
She's so beautiful, really.	Muhle kakhulu, impela.
No one really knows why.	Akekho owaziyo ngempela ukuthi kungani.
It should.	Bekufanele .
He came, but he did not know what to do.	Weza, kodwa wayengazi ukuthi enzeni.
And friend, of course.	Futhi umngane, kunjalo.
I made a big mistake.	Ngenze iphutha elikhulu.
Not always, of course.	Hhayi njalo, kunjalo.
We have made a good plan.	Senze icebo elihle.
Sure, you know that.	Impela, uyakwazi lokho.
He had to be her friend.	Kwadingeka abe umngane wakhe.
It had to be a lie.	Kwakufanele kube amanga.
Yes it should be.	Yebo kufanele kube yilokho.
But that's perfectly fine.	Kodwa lokho kulungile ngokuphelele.
Mom can't help you.	Umama akakwazi ukukusiza.
At least, that.	Okungenani, ngalokho.
That's it, and that's all.	Yilokho, futhi yilokho kuphela.
What a child.	Yeka ingane.
My question is how hard it is to find one.	Umbuzo wami uthi kunzima kanjani ukuthola omunye.
He just went in and took it.	Wangena nje wathatha.
No one else in the car.	Akekho omunye emotweni.
You will need to hear more.	Uzodinga ukuzwa okuningi.
Not if you know what you are doing.	Hhayi uma wazi ukuthi wenzani.
He has been there a long time.	Ukhona isikhathi eside.
We know.	Siyazi .
He wants to know everything that happened.	Ufuna ukwazi konke okwenzekile.
But he did not want to do that with her.	Kodwa wayengafuni ukwenza lokho naye.
That for now.	Lokho okwamanje.
You mean the same thing.	Usho into efanayo nawe.
Still nothing is happening.	Noma kunjalo akukho okwenzekayo.
You can’t think your way there.	Awukwazi ukucabanga ngendlela yakho lapho.
There is something else I have to do.	Kukhona okunye okumele ngikwenze.
He should be able to read.	Kufanele akwazi ukufunda.
To find out what really happened.	Ukuze uthole ukuthi kwenzekeni ngempela.
Cooking sometimes, too.	Ukupheka ngezinye izikhathi, futhi.
This is not a decision.	Lesi akusona isinqumo.
But it is difficult to say.	Kodwa kunzima ukusho.
But that is not here yet.	Kodwa lokho akukho lapha okwamanje.
And he did this very well.	Futhi lokhu wakwenza kahle kakhulu.
You need to think things through.	Kudingeka ucabange kahle izinto.
I never thought of living without him.	Ngangingacabangi ukuphila ngaphandle kwakhe.
I want to be.	Ngifuna ukuba.
Not so much the guy in front of him.	Hhayi kakhulu umfana ngaphambi kwakhe.
It's just one thing.	Yinto eyodwa nje.
I think my choice is right.	Ngicabanga ukuthi ukukhetha kwami ​​kulungile.
And you can do it.	Futhi ungakwenza.
He just said he wouldn't do it.	Wathi nje angeke akwenze.
It will not be easy.	Ngeke kuze kube lula.
Yes, it seems.	Yebo, kubonakala sengathi.
I'm sure you feel the same way.	Nginesiqiniseko sokuthi nawe uzizwa ngendlela efanayo.
I wish your mother was there.	Ngifisa sengathi ngabe umama wakho ukhona.
This person is not there.	Akekho lo muntu.
I don't understand why, really.	Angiqondi ukuthi kungani, ngempela.
It's just better for me.	Kungcono nje kimi.
I'm glad you are willing to help us.	Ngiyajabula ukuthi uzimisele ukusisiza.
Let me say a few things about this book.	Ake ngisho izinto ezimbalwa ngale ncwadi.
Or he didn't want to.	Noma wayengafuni.
He is present at that moment.	Ukhona ngaleso sikhathi.
He does not know whether he entered the office.	Akazi noma wangena ehhovisi.
This starts early.	Lokhu kuqala kusenesikhathi.
He really thought that.	Ngempela wacabanga lowo.
Eventually a person may be alone.	Ekugcineni umuntu angase abe yedwa yedwa.
You can walk down the aisle.	Ungakwazi ukuhamba phansi.
He could not find out why.	Akakwazanga ukuthola ukuthi kungani.
Not a good thing for him, either.	Akuyona into enhle kuye, futhi.
Pretend he has never been.	Enza sengathi akakaze abe khona.
But on time.	Kodwa ngesikhathi.
I finally know why.	Ekugcineni ngiyazi ukuthi kungani.
He should not talk to me.	Akufanele akhulume nami.
To do that, you have to be beautiful.	Ukuze wenze lokho, kuzomele ube muhle.
I do not want to go anywhere.	Angifuni ukuya ndawo.
Everyone is trying to make money.	Wonke umuntu uzama ukwenza imali.
What's going on here? 	Kwenzakalani lapha?
He asked me for help.	Wangicela usizo.
He looked like he too needed help.	Wayebukeka sengathi naye udinga usizo.
This is good for us.	Lokhu kuhle kithi.
But we need.	Kodwa sidinga.
But in this case, you don't need to.	Kodwa kulokhu, awudingi.
I'm leaving soon.	Ngizohamba maduze.
Yes, that's right, but not just.	Yebo, kunjalo, kodwa hhayi nje.
Last night .	Izolo ebusuku .
Please, three questions.	Ngicela, imibuzo emithathu.
So you say.	Ngakho usho.
He doesn't even have a gun.	Empeleni akanaso ngisho isibhamu.
More on that later, perhaps.	Okuningi ngalokho kamuva, mhlawumbe.
Maybe something bad is happening.	Mhlawumbe kukhona okubi okwenzekayo.
I don't have a car right now.	Anginayo imoto njengamanje.
Maybe he never got there.	Mhlawumbe akazange afike lapho.
That's a lot of meat.	Inyama eningi impela leyo.
I have never seen such a beautiful person before.	Angikaze ngibone umuntu omuhle kangaka ngaphambili.
He could not pretend that he was not.	Akakwazanga ukwenza sengathi akunjalo.
You thought too hard.	Ucabange kanzima kakhulu.
And you should know.	Futhi kufanele ukwazi.
His spirit, his.	Umoya wakhe, wakhe.
I want to get into that a little bit.	Ngifuna ukungena kulokho kancane.
So it had to be all or nothing.	Ngakho kwakufanele kube konke noma lutho.
And that is exactly what is happening here and now.	Futhi yilokho kanye okwenzeka lapha futhi manje.
He finally decided to leave.	Ekugcineni wanquma ukuhamba.
That's what you want me to do.	Yilokho ofuna ngikwenze.
You know who you're playing with here.	Uyazi ukuthi udlala nobani lapha.
And this is easily seen.	Futhi lokhu kubonakala kalula.
But he has not told the truth yet.	Kodwa akazange akhulume iqiniso okwamanje.
I doubt it though.	Ngiyangabaza kodwa.
Good enough for now.	Kuhle ngokwanele okwamanje.
At least this way you will not be alone.	Okungenani ngale ndlela ngeke ube wedwa.
He wanted a dog.	Wayefuna inja.
This can only be a good thing.	Lokhu kungaba yinto enhle kuphela.
He should have been there for her.	Kwakufanele abe khona lapho ngenxa yakhe.
He does things his own way.	Wenza izinto ngendlela yakhe.
I would just like to.	Ngingathanda kuphela.
It can be too long.	Kungaba isikhathi eside kakhulu.
We want to do something.	Sifuna ukwenza okuthile.
But he did not want to do it.	Kodwa wayengafuni ukukwenza.
They say that he is simply not human.	Bathi akuyena neze umuntu.
This, of course, did not happen.	Lokhu, kunjalo, akuzange kwenzeke.
Now let's.	Manje ake.
Not you either.	Hhayi wena futhi.
Whenever, and with whom, he was not sure.	Nini nje, futhi nobani, wayengenaso isiqiniseko.
As fast as you like.	Ngokushesha njengoba uthanda.
You never have, you have to.	Awukaze ube, kufanele.
And sometimes, it really is.	Futhi ngezinye izikhathi, kunjalo ngempela.
Or maybe go to her.	Noma mhlawumbe uye kuye.
But still the same problem.	Kodwa namanje inkinga efanayo.
And he tried to get out of there and he did.	Futhi wazama ukuphuma lapho futhi wenza.
None other than him.	Akekho omunye ngaphandle kwakhe.
Maybe it's time for us to do something.	Mhlawumbe sekuyisikhathi sokuthi senze okuthile.
Absolutely worth it !!!.	Kufanele ngokuphelele !!!.
But the music has been good for me.	Kodwa umculo ube muhle kimi.
Almost too.	Cishe kakhulu.
And to me.	Futhi ukuba mina.
And to him it was worth it.	Futhi kuye kwakufanele.
Me and you, too.	Mina nawe, futhi.
So now my job is to make a plan.	Ngakho manje umsebenzi wami ukwenza uhlelo.
Your age too.	Iminyaka yakho futhi.
And that's the key.	Futhi lokho ukhiye.
But she looks very happy.	Kodwa ubukeka ejabule kakhulu.
You have to buy a book.	Kufanele uthenge incwadi.
Sometimes you go for it.	Ngezinye izikhathi uya ngakho.
And not just the kids, but also him.	Futhi hhayi nje izingane, kodwa futhi naye.
I do not know anyone else.	Angazi omunye.
Sometimes I make coffee.	Ngezinye izikhathi ngenza ikhofi.
I am convinced that this is true.	Ngiqinisekile ukuthi kulokhu kuyiqiniso.
It actually works a little bit now.	Empeleni usebenza kancane manje.
I do everything with him.	Ngenza konke naye.
You should be happy first.	Kufanele ujabule kuqala.
He says things.	Uthi izinto.
And we need to find out who did this.	Futhi sidinga ukuthola ukuthi ubani owenze lokhu.
She is afraid to hear his voice.	Uyesaba ukuzwa izwi lakhe.
Don't forget the date.	Ungakhohlwa usuku.
He says your new thing in this.	Uthi into yakho entsha kulokhu.
That's all this time.	Yilokho sonke lesi sikhathi.
And it seems to be true.	Futhi kubonakala kuyiqiniso.
Apparently so, at least for now.	Kubonakala kunjalo, okungenani kuze kube manje.
I would love to do something about that.	Ngingathanda ukwenza okuthile ngalokho.
That is not the question at all.	Akuwona nhlobo umbuzo lowo.
I have to go too.	Nami kufanele ngihambe.
Good family too.	Umndeni omuhle futhi.
It will not be so perhaps.	Ngeke kube njalo mhlawumbe.
We need to do well.	Kudingeka senze kahle.
It is difficult but it will happen.	Kunzima kodwa kuzokwenzeka.
Please think about it a little bit.	Ngicela ucabange ngakho kancane.
How are u doing? 	Uzokwenza kanjani?
But you got more.	Kodwa uthole okunye.
Just for the sake of someone.	Ukuze nje kube khona umuntu.
There is no one right answer for everyone.	Ayikho impendulo eyodwa efanele wonke umuntu.
This is not the reason.	Lokhu akusona isizathu.
You should eat more.	Kufanele udle kakhulu.
Sometimes it may be.	Ngezinye izikhathi kungase kube njalo.
He finally decided to go out.	Ekugcineni wanquma ukuphuma.
I'm glad to see you doing well.	Ngiyajabula ukukubona wenza kahle.
Now, stop crying.	Manje, yeka ukukhala.
Instead of how he is now.	Esikhundleni sokuthi abe kanjani manje.
It's been almost a week.	Sekuphele cishe isonto lonke.
You work hard, you have to.	Usebenza kanzima, kufanele.
But it is good this way.	Kodwa kuhle ngale ndlela.
I heard something else.	Ngezwa ukuthi kukhona okunye.
I want to get out.	Ngifuna ukuphuma.
He began to hear things.	Waqala ukuzwa izinto.
And maybe not alone.	Futhi mhlawumbe ungabi yedwa.
Not you, not here, not now.	Hhayi wena, hhayi lapha, hhayi manje.
And a very nice car.	Futhi imoto enhle kakhulu.
By that we all know.	Ngalokho sonke siyazi.
You need to stop sleeping completely.	Udinga ukuyeka ukulala ngokuphelele.
To know where you are.	Ukuze wazi lapho ukhona.
And he should try, at least.	Futhi kufanele azame, okungenani.
He went out with her and looked over.	Waphuma naye wabheka ngale.
Sometimes that can happen.	Ngezinye izikhathi lokho kungenzeka.
You want to be here again now.	Ufuna ukuba lapha futhi manje.
It is very difficult to adjust the visual acuity.	Kunzima kakhulu ukulungisa ukubona kahle.
You go there, too.	Uya lapho, futhi.
Alone with him.	Eyedwa naye.
He didn't know what else.	Wayengazi ukuthi yini enye.
Great, too.	Enkulu, futhi.
Same thing if you did something good.	Into efanayo uma wenze into enhle.
He didn't want me to talk about it.	Wayengafuni ngikhulume ngakho.
I received my gift yesterday.	Ngithole isipho sami izolo.
Exactly this place.	Impela le ndawo.
I would love to hear why.	Ngingathanda ukuzwa ukuthi kungani kunjalo.
You better do something about it.	Kungcono wenze okuthile ngayo.
The whole room.	Igumbi lonke.
I think there is an idea.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kukhona umbono.
So, he's sitting there.	Ngakho, uhlezi lapho.
At least he tried, at first.	Okungenani wazama, ekuqaleni.
But he did.	Kodwa lowo wakwenza.
I have always wanted very much.	Bengilokhu ngifuna kakhulu.
He knows everything about you.	Wazi konke ngawe.
You work slowly.	Usebenza kancane.
I would like to know about it.	Ngifisa ukwazi ngakho.
Probably a big question.	Mhlawumbe umbuzo omkhulu.
We also do not have to do all the work.	Nathi asikho isidingo sokuthi senze wonke umsebenzi.
He speaks quickly, before he can.	Ukhuluma ngokushesha, ngaphambi kokuba akwazi.
So you have to go.	Ngakho kufanele uhambe.
All easily.	Konke kalula.
She and her family.	Yena nomndeni wakhe.
Everyday work.	Nsuku zonke ukusebenza.
You need to travel to the city.	Udinga ukuhamba edolobheni.
You've done the job perfectly.	Wenze umsebenzi ngokuphelele.
I mean right now.	Ngisho khona manje.
That's his whole life.	Lokho ukuphila kwakhe konke.
I could not stop coming.	Angikwazanga ukuyeka ukuza.
And this is hard to do.	Futhi lokhu kunzima ukukwenza.
But that's okay, too.	Kodwa lokho kulungile, futhi.
He can do better than me.	Angenza kangcono kunami.
That has been really good.	Lokho kube kuhle ngempela.
So at home ,, and sleep.	Ngakho ekhaya,, futhi ukulala.
Up here long enough.	Phezulu lapha isikhathi eside ngokwanele.
I need to hear from you.	Ngidinga ukuzwa kuwe.
He said to me again.	Wathi nami futhi.
He knows what to do.	Uyazi ukuthi yini okufanele ayenze.
I do not know anyone in prison.	Angazi muntu ejele.
He sits there, unable to walk.	Uhlale lapho, akakwazi ukuhamba.
Obviously, you need the right place.	Ngokusobala, udinga indawo efanele.
You want to stay awhile.	Ufuna ukuhlala isikhashana.
He felt his spirit.	Wezwa umoya wakhe.
It will take time to get things done.	Kuzothatha isikhathi ukuthola izinto.
New problem.	Inkinga entsha.
Everyone knew something.	Wonke umuntu wayazi okuthile.
I didn't say that, of course.	Angizange ngisho lokho, kunjalo.
All of this means nothing.	Konke lokhu akusho lutho.
All me, my fault.	Konke mina, iphutha lami.
It will not be too difficult to fix.	Ngeke kube nzima kakhulu ukulungisa.
My father never read a book.	Ubaba akakaze afunde incwadi.
And very, very good.	Futhi enhle kakhulu impela.
That's all for now.	Yilokho kuphela okwamanje.
Just once in the beginning, and again.	Kanye nje ekuqaleni, futhi futhi.
It seems like it really is.	Kubonakala sengathi empeleni.
We have done such a wonderful thing.	Senze into enhle kangaka.
But today my father heard a loud noise.	Kodwa namuhla ubaba wezwa umsindo omkhulu.
Not since.	Hhayi kusukela .
But tell me about it.	Kodwa ngitshele ngakho.
But that does not mean that there is no danger.	Kodwa lokho akusho ukuthi ingozi ayikho.
Down on the floor.	Phansi phansi.
Almost all day.	Cishe usuku lonke.
I think it could be.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kungenzeka kube njalo.
Nothing to say.	Akukho okufanele ukusho.
I never thought it would be easy.	Angikaze ngicabange ukuthi kuzoba lula.
He can do it, too.	Angakwenza, futhi.
I will go with you anywhere.	Ngizohamba nawe noma kuphi.
He knew what he wanted to do, too.	Wayazi ukuthi wayefuna ukwenzani, futhi.
Mother in a hospital bed.	Umama embhedeni esibhedlela.
I was saying maybe you know.	Bengithi mhlawumbe uyazi.
That's the picture, the picture, your picture.	Leso isithombe, isithombe, isithombe sakho.
Not for him, of course.	Hhayi ngaye, kusobala.
And he said he was determined.	Futhi wathi uzimisele.
He had to stop doing that.	Kwadingeka ayeke ukwenza lokho.
I walked over to him.	Ngihambe ngiye kuye.
Maybe that's why you're here.	Mhlawumbe yingakho ulapha.
Earlier in the office.	Ngaphambili ehhovisi.
This is not going to be great right now.	Lokhu ngeke kube enkulu okwamanje.
A gun, maybe.	Isibhamu, mhlawumbe.
He’s a good player too.	Ungumdlali omuhle futhi.
He should seek this.	Kufanele afune lokhu.
There is something I have to go with.	Kukhona okumele ngihambe nakho.
And a little money.	Futhi imali encane.
I just can't think of a plan at all.	Angikwazi nje ukucabanga uhlelo ngokuphelele.
Until an accident happened.	Kuze kwenzeke ingozi.
It must be, to know your mother.	Kumele kube, ukwazi umama wakho.
We had to find out why.	Kwadingeka sithole ukuthi kungani.
And he says.	Futhi uthi .
You can do it right now.	Ungakwenza njengamanje.
From the ground up.	Kusukela phansi.
It's too stupid for me.	Isilima kakhulu kimi.
And it's not stupid, okay.	Futhi akusona isilima, kulungile.
That should be a very good case.	Lokho kufanele kube icala elihle kakhulu.
At least the doctor can.	Okungenani udokotela angakwazi.
He did not expect to be away for long.	Wayengacabangi ukuthi uzohlala isikhathi eside engekho.
But my mother always goes there.	Kodwa umama uya khona ngaso sonke isikhathi.
So let's get cooking.	Ngakho ake sithole ukupheka.
You can do it anytime.	Ungakwenza noma nini.
I will not do that to you.	Angeke ngikwenze lokho kuwe.
He wanted to go, he told me.	Wayefuna ukuhamba, wangitshela.
Now this is not always a problem.	Manje lokhu akuyona inkinga njalo.
Very, very quickly.	Kakhulu, ngokushesha okukhulu.
I will do it as soon as possible.	Ngizokwenza ngokushesha ngangokunokwenzeka.
But not here, not now.	Kodwa hhayi lapha, hhayi manje.
At least not always.	Okungenani hhayi ngaso sonke isikhathi.
Eat sitting at a table and eat a little.	Udle uhlezi etafuleni udle kancane.
With that, he will do it.	Ngalokho, uzokwenza.
It can't happen.	Angeke kwenzeke.
You will not really go.	Ngeke ngempela uhambe.
But that seems possible.	Kodwa lokho kubonakala kungenzeka.
We know this is not the case.	Siyazi ukuthi akunjalo.
But you learn quickly.	Kodwa ufunda ngokushesha.
It could be your mother or your father.	Kungaba umama wakho noma ubaba wakho.
You know, like that.	Uyazi, kanjalo.
I can probably do this.	Ngingakwenza mhlawumbe lokhu.
I could not have done this without your help.	Angikwazanga ukwenza lokhu ngaphandle kosizo lwakho.
I just started here.	Ngisanda kuqala lapha.
I think that would be great.	Ngicabanga ukuthi lokho kuzoba kuhle.
I said yes right there.	Ngathi yebo khona lapho.
Ultimately, we have to do that.	Ekugcineni, kufanele sikwenze lokho.
Almost a small risk.	Cishe ingozi encane.
Really, she is very beautiful.	Impela, muhle kakhulu.
Great mistake today.	Iphutha elikhulu namuhla.
I too am amazed.	Nami ngiyamangala.
I want to talk to her now.	Ngifuna ukukhuluma naye manje.
Eventually, he died.	Ekugcineni, washona.
It’s not my story though.	Akuyona indaba yami noma kunjalo.
That is not just my opinion.	Lokho akuwona nje umbono wami.
Please, no crying.	Ngicela, akukho ukukhala.
So much is happening.	Ngakho kuningi okwenzekayo.
You will go with him.	Uzohamba naye.
That is not what happened early.	Akukhona lokho okwenzeka kusenesikhathi.
Food is really hard.	Ukudla kunzima impela.
I'm so glad to have you here.	Ngijabule kakhulu ukuba nawe lapha.
He asked me to stay here.	Wangicela ukuthi ngihlale lapha.
You will be helpful.	Uzoba usizo.
Now you know he exists.	Manje uyazi ukuthi ukhona.
He said he would be back soon.	Wathi uzobuya maduze.
I have tried this way too.	Ngike ngazama ngale ndlela nokuthi.
None of this.	Akekho kulokhu.
But not the pain.	Kodwa hhayi ubuhlungu.
Thank you so much for this.	Ngiyabonga kakhulu ngalokhu.
He had to eat with her.	Bekumele adle naye.
Your great opportunity.	Ithuba lakho elikhulu.
We have to do it often.	Kufanele sikwenze kaningi.
Sometimes food, but not always.	Ngezinye izikhathi ukudla, kodwa hhayi njalo.
Easily and quickly agreed.	Kalula futhi ngokushesha wavuma.
He wanted air.	Wayefuna umoya.
This is not a bad thing at all.	Lokhu akuyona into embi ngokuphelele.
Sounds good.	Kuzwakala kuhle.
But marriage.	Kodwa umshado .
We are not in the beginning.	Asikho ekuqaleni.
I didn't want to do it either.	Nami ngangingafuni ukwenza.
Or you try, anyway.	Noma uzama, noma kanjani.
And about him.	Futhi ngaye.
I never thought how you must feel.	Angizange ngicabange ukuthi kumelwe ukuba uzizwa kanjani.
When he was young.	Lapho kade esemncane.
I think it would be great.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kungaba kuhle kakhulu.
He had to know, so he could choose his own way.	Kwakufanele azi, ukuze akwazi ukukhetha indlela yakhe.
Because it seems now that he can do anything.	Ngoba kubonakala manje ukuthi angenza noma yini.
But she was not a mother.	Kodwa kwakungeyena umama.
My mother came with me in the morning.	Umama wafika nami ekuseni.
Our vision began to flow.	Umbono wethu waqala ukuhamba.
I can't help you with that, either.	Angikwazi ukukusiza ngalokho, nami.
He has to think.	Kumele acabange.
His vision gradually became clearer.	Umbono wakhe wabonakala kancane kancane.
He doesn't have a plan, he doesn't.	Akanalo uhlelo, akunjalo.
He wanted me to have everything.	Wayefuna ngibe nakho konke.
Maybe it would be better.	Mhlawumbe kube ngcono.
Not a very good answer.	Akuyona impendulo enhle kakhulu.
Not exactly, but close.	Hhayi impela, kodwa eduze.
I can't stay home.	Angikwazi ukuhlala ekhaya.
Not the way you did it.	Hhayi indlela owenze ngayo.
Indeed, it is not a single problem.	Ngempela, akuyona inkinga eyodwa.
You want to know the truth.	Ufuna ukwazi iqiniso.
You look like me, you know.	Ufana nami, uyazi.
We need the whole story.	Sidinga yonke indaba.
I'm happy too.	Nami ngiyajabula.
Indeed, he could not wait.	Ngempela, akakwazanga ukulinda.
But that did not happen.	Kodwa akuzange kwenzeke kanjalo.
I'm not sure where it is right now.	Angiqiniseki ukuthi kuphi okwamanje.
I just couldn’t see that at the time.	Angikwazanga nje ukukubona lokho ngaleso sikhathi.
There is no reason.	Asikho isizathu.
Yes, that's what he said.	Yebo, yilokho akusho.
You know you can cook.	Uyazi uyakwazi ukupheka.
You make one where you are.	Wenza eyodwa lapho ukhona.
But you need to go to the hospital.	Kodwa udinga ukuya esibhedlela.
Not very well, but he managed.	Hhayi kahle kakhulu, kodwa wakwazi.
I wanted to make my time.	Bengifuna ukwenza isikhathi sami.
One, hopefully, many.	Omunye, ngethemba, abaningi.
This is not me! 	Akumina lo!
Tell me how this happened.	Ngitshele ukuthi kwenzeka kanjani lokhu.
I don’t think so, though.	Angicabangi, noma kunjalo.
And the same thing happened.	Futhi kwenzeka into efanayo.
Not a problem, obviously.	Akuyona inkinga, ngokusobala.
I couldn’t cook about this.	Angikwazanga ukupheka ngalokhu.
And that's it there.	Futhi yilokho lapho.
There is, always.	Kukhona, njalo.
He tried his best.	Wazama ngakho konke okusemandleni akhe.
That was unnecessary.	Lokho kwakungadingeki.
You need to get water here.	Udinga ukuthola amanzi lapha.
But, he had to leave.	Kodwa, kwadingeka ahambe.
One probably knows, the other probably not.	Omunye cishe uyazi, omunye mhlawumbe hhayi.
He should do so.	Kufanele akwenze njalo.
There is a beautiful place.	Kukhona indawo enhle.
He knew nothing but me.	Wayengazi lutho ngaphandle kwami.
Not a bit! 	Hhayi kancane!
We just need to find our place.	Sidinga nje ukuthola indawo yethu.
You are not my mother.	Awuyena umama wami.
He did not know anyone in the city.	Wayengazi muntu edolobheni.
That you will be fine.	Ukuthi uzohamba kahle.
He entered the place.	Wangena endaweni.
In the world, maybe for a long time.	Emhlabeni, mhlawumbe isikhathi eside.
You can't make it human.	Ngeke ukwenze umuntu.
This is a month, not a week.	Lokhu ngenyanga, hhayi ngesonto.
He came back slowly.	Abuye kancane kancane.
I hope that.	Ngethemba lokho.
Everyone just looked down.	Wonke umuntu wavele wabheka phansi.
I would really like to say that.	Ngingathanda ngempela ukusho lokho.
And stop talking about it.	Futhi yeka ukukhuluma ngakho.

At a young age.	Esemncane.
And money is a thing.	Futhi imali yinto.

But if you want to talk anyway.	Kodwa uma ufuna ukukhuluma noma kunjalo.
No, not you.	Hhayi, hhayi wena.

And since, he asked.	Futhi kusukela, wabuza.

A new way, in the evening.	Indlela entsha, kusihlwa.
She looks surprised.	Ubonakala emangele.
I like to travel from the beginning.	Ngithanda ukuhamba kusukela ekuqaleni.
Of course he would not be her friend.	Yebo wayengeke abe umngane wakhe.
I do read.	Ngenza ukufunda.
But there is no major problem.	Kodwa ayikho inkinga enkulu.
And he did not want to stay.	Futhi wayengafuni ukuhlala.
And yes, that's great.	Futhi yebo, lokho kuhle kakhulu.
I just didn't think.	Angizange nje ngicabange.

Just buy a hat.	Ukuthenga nje isigqoko.
You just have to be more discriminating with the help you render toward other people.	Kuzomele ube nje.
Or, at least, that is the plan.	Noma, okungenani, icebo lelo.
See if you stay that way.	Abone ukuthi uhlala kanjalo.
I do not want this to happen.	Angifuni kwenzeke lokhu.
All we have to do is wait.	Okufanele sikwenze ukulinda.
Death by hearing.	Ukufa ukuzwa.
So let me tell you why.	Ngakho ake ngikutshele ukuthi kungani.
You will do this several times a night.	Uzokwenza lokhu izikhathi eziningi ebusuku.
I like food.	Ngithanda ukudla.
And that's me.	Futhi yimi lowo.
So someone saw it.	Ngakho othile wabona.
But that would be a good thing.	Kodwa lokho kungaba yinto enhle.
I will not be a doctor.	Ngeke ngibe udokotela.
Testing is required.	Kudingeka ukuhlolwa.
I think he is good at this.	Ngicabanga ukuthi muhle kulokhu.
Sometimes we have to walk first.	Ngezinye izikhathi kudingeka sihambe kuqala.
Your father, of course.	Ubaba wakho, kunjalo.
Or at all.	Noma nhlobo.
You can do it here.	Ungakwenza lapha.

Or come and sit in the car.	Noma eze ahlale emotweni.
This may be helpful later.	Lokhu kungase kube usizo kamuva.
Tomorrow could be you.	Kusasa kungaba uwena.
Now he is not sure.	Manje akanaso isiqiniseko.
That just can't happen.	Lokho ngeke nje kwenzeke.
I just arrived today.	Ngifike nje namuhla.
He has never talked to us about it.	Akakaze akhulume nathi ngakho.
I always want more.	Ngihlale ngifuna okwengeziwe.
I thought you would win.	Bengicabanga ukuthi uzowina.
I think you will be able to do that.	Ngicabanga ukuthi uzokwazi ukwenza lokho.
But it is good to be honest, though.	Kodwa kuhle ukukhuluma iqiniso, noma kunjalo.
Not long, really.	Hhayi isikhathi eside, ngempela.
But everyone says he did.	Kodwa wonke umuntu uthi wenze.
I don't think he's out there.	Angicabangi ukuthi akekho lapho.
And he could not.	Futhi akazange akwazi.
I have to feel pain.	Kufanele ngizwe ubuhlungu.
Such a small thing.	Into encane kanjalo.
Just like I want more time with me.	Njengoba nje ngifuna isikhathi esengeziwe nami.
He wouldn't have that.	Wayengeke abe nakho lokho.
I had to do something to do more.	Kwakudingeka ngenze okuthile ukuze ngenze okwengeziwe.
I asked about it.	Ngabuza ngakho.
But that really isn't my story.	Kodwa empeleni akuyona indaba yami.
Yes, not at all.	Yebo, lutho neze.
He did this all the time.	Wakwenza lokhu ngaso sonke isikhathi.
He hoped he would stay that way.	Wayenethemba lokuthi uzohlala enjalo.
Because it really should.	Ngoba kufanele ngempela.
My mother came out and went in.	Waphuma umama wangena.
He will do that anyway.	Uzokwenza lokho noma kunjalo.
There is no life.	Akukho ukuphila.
Well, you never know.	Hhayi, ngeke wazi.
He didn't really know he was coming.	Wayengazi ngempela ukuthi uyeza.
Or you can do it today.	Noma ungakwenza namuhla.
But he also thought.	Kodwa naye wayecabanga.
This may be difficult at first.	Lokhu kungase kube nzima ekuqaleni.
I would not have thought that he could.	Bengingeke ngicabange ukuthi uyakwazi.
Not yet, anyway.	Hhayi okwamanje, noma kanjani.
But does this make sense.	Kodwa ingabe lokhu kuzwakala.
Death happened immediately.	Ukufa kwenzeka ngokushesha.
He will be anytime now.	Uzoba noma nini manje.
But we all know that it will not.	Kodwa sonke siyazi ukuthi ngeke.
I do not want to die like this.	Angifuni ukufa kanje.
You did not stay there long.	Awuzange uhlale isikhathi eside lapho.
Not just me, him too.	Hhayi mina kuphela, naye futhi.
Not at all his word.	Akulona neze izwi lakhe.
But he left.	Kodwa wahamba .

I did a lot this morning.	Ngikwenze kakhulu namuhla ekuseni.
But he alone.	Kodwa yena kuphela.
And we did.	Futhi senza kanjalo.
He began to think seriously about her.	Waqala ukucabanga ngaye kakhulu.
However, he should go the same way.	Noma kunjalo, kufanele ahambe ngendlela efanayo.
This is his job.	Umsebenzi wakhe lo.
He didn't even know if he was going to college.	Wayengazi nokuthi uzoya yini ekolishi.
I do not know.	angazi.
He will not be too hard to find.	Angeke abe nzima kakhulu ukuthola.
And anything else can be.	Futhi noma yini enye kungaba .
This seems to be happening.	Lokhu kubonakala kwenzeka.
I mean that really.	Ngisho lokho ngempela.
Instead he wanted money.	Kunalokho wayefuna imali.
I feel that way sometimes.	Ngizizwa kanjalo ngezinye izikhathi.
Sometimes we have to go too far.	Ngezinye izikhathi kufanele lapho siye kakhulu.
About tomorrow.	Cishe kusasa.
It does not mean that it is not true.	Akusho ukuthi akulona iqiniso.
He came in.	Wafika phakathi.
Easy enough.	Kalula ngokwanele.
I'm sorry but you are very wrong.	Ngiyaxolisa kodwa unephutha kakhulu.
He promised that she would be fine.	Wathembisa ukuthi uzoba muhle.
It’s better to think that anyway.	Kungcono ukucabanga ukuthi noma kunjalo.
We all know he is good enough to do it.	Sonke siyazi ukuthi muhle ngokwanele ukuba akwenze.
It should not be so.	Akufanele nathi sibe njalo.
No one does that.	Akekho owenza kanjalo.
You know how that sounds.	Uyazi ukuthi kuzwakala kanjani lokho.
You'll just be fine.	Uzoba kahle nje.
Or that's what he told me.	Noma yilokho angitshele khona.
He admitted everything anyway.	Wavuma yonke into noma kunjalo.
His coat.	Ijazi lakhe.
That there will be no choice.	Ukuthi ngeke kube khona ukukhetha.
I like this better.	Ngithanda lokhu kangcono.
He did not stay long anywhere.	Akazange ahlale isikhathi eside ndawo.
But not in the office.	Kodwa hhayi ehhovisi.
But this happened about three years ago.	Kodwa lokhu kwenzeka cishe eminyakeni emithathu edlule.
This is our new thing.	Lena into yethu entsha.
He does not want to do that.	Akafuni ukwenza lokho.
No one did that.	Akekho owenze kanjalo.
I wanted to make the right choice.	Ngangifuna ukwenza ukukhetha okufanele.
You will win.	Uzowina.
That is exactly what he did this time.	Yilokho kanye akwenza ngalesi sikhathi.
He knew about you.	Wayazi ngawe.
It could be a picture.	Kungaba isithombe.
And outside.	Futhi ngaphandle.
Because he did this.	Ngoba wakwenza lokhu.
In college, obviously not.	Ekolishi, kusobala ukuthi akunjalo.
Now or late.	Manje noma sekwephuzile.
Just a nice place.	Indawo enhle nje.
The bigger, the better.	Okukhulu, kungcono.
But he may have told me.	Kodwa kungenzeka ukuthi wangitshela.
It is obvious.	Kubonakala ngokusobala.
I wanted to be better.	Ngangifuna ukuba ngcono.
No, thank you.	Hhayi, ngiyabonga.
To make it better.	Ukwenza kube ngcono.
Unless that is not the case.	Ngaphandle kokuthi nalokho akulona iqiniso.
Too many guns.	Isibhamu esiningi kakhulu.
You play times.	Udlala izikhathi.
He is happy with you.	Ujabule nawe.
Yes, that's all.	Yebo, yilokho konke lokhu.
This has been a good thing.	Lokhu kube yinto enhle.

He is our best young man.	Uyinsizwa yethu engcono kakhulu.
He came here last night.	Ufike lapha izolo ebusuku.
No, he said, he was not.	Cha, wathi, wayengekho.
So we can't go on.	Ngakho asikwazi ukuqhubeka.
I got a call very early in the morning.	Ngithole ucingo ekuseni kakhulu.
What to do.	Okufanele ukwenze .
And that, too, is really good.	Futhi lokho, nakho, kuhle ngempela.

I don't know if you know that or not.	Angazi noma uyakwazi lokho noma cha.
He admitted that he did not.	Wavuma ukuthi akazange.
To be honest, you say that a lot.	Ukukhuluma iqiniso, usho lokho kakhulu.
But he did not want to hear that.	Kodwa wayengafuni ukuzwa lokho.
You better stay close to me.	Kungcono uhlale eduze kwami.
We know how beautiful she is.	Siyazi ukuthi muhle kangakanani.
Here he found the whole group.	Lapha wathola lonke iqembu.
And this time she is wearing a dress.	Futhi kulokhu ugqoke ingubo.
Not good, okay.	Hhayi kuhle, kulungile.
I feel pain but not so much.	Ngizwa ubuhlungu kodwa hhayi kangako.
All in all, if you like.	Konke, uma uthanda.
He said yes at the end.	Wathi yebo ekugcineni.
You also have to do something about it.	Kufanele futhi wenze okuthile ngalokho.
This may be a little off.	Lokhu kungase kube kancane.
He took coffee.	Wathatha ikhofi.
Singing and all that.	Ukucula nakho konke lokho.
Speaking in amazement.	Ekhuluma emangele.
We make mistakes.	Senza amaphutha.
Yes my book.	Yebo incwadi yami.
She's worried now.	Ukhathazekile manje.
It could be really better.	Kungaba ngcono ngempela.
You mean .	Usho ukuthi .
But for now, it's better to be with me, too.	Kodwa okwamanje, kungcono kakhulu ukuba nami, futhi.
You do not really want to do that.	Awufuni ngempela ukwenza lokho.
He is a great teacher.	Unguthisha omkhulu.
Not everyone, though.	Akuwona wonke umuntu, noma kunjalo.
He was not alone at that time.	Wayengeyena yedwa ngaleso sikhathi.
Obviously, he knows nothing about this.	Ngokusobala, akazi lutho ngalokhu.
I feel good too.	Ngizwa kahle futhi.
And you will know.	Futhi uzokwazi.
I did not think so.	Bengingacabangi.
But that does not mean quitting.	Kodwa lokho akusho ukuyeka.
It may be a few months.	Kungase kube izinyanga ezimbalwa.
I could not do this now.	Angikwazanga ukwenza lokhu manje.
That is not the same story here.	Lokho akuyona indaba efanayo lapha.
But again, too much.	Kodwa futhi, okuningi kakhulu.
He talked to me a little.	Wakhuluma nami kancane.
You can't do it there.	Awukwazi ukukwenza lapho.
This is absolutely unnecessary.	Lokhu akudingekile neze.
And that's not our boy.	Futhi akuyena umfana wethu lowo.
I just know what it is now.	Ngiyazi nje ukuthi yini manje.
You have to spend a lot of time outside.	Kufanele wenze isikhathi esiningi ngaphandle.
But no one really knows about it.	Kodwa akekho owaziyo ngakho.
Out in the world.	Ngaphandle emhlabeni.
But he also should not go alone.	Kodwa futhi akufanele ahambe yedwa.
Not really spoken.	Hhayi wakhuluma ngempela.
I never heard of it.	Angizange ngizwe nhlobo.
Not since summer.	Hhayi kusukela ehlobo.
That is tomorrow.	Kusasa lokho.
He stayed with me, too.	Wahlala nami, futhi.
To do it.	Ukuze ngikwenze.
He likes to walk slowly alone.	Uthanda ukuhamba kancane yedwa.
No, this is not a good idea.	Cha, lokhu akulona neze icebo elihle.
I’ll just do it and see what happens.	Ngizokwenza nje futhi ngibone ukuthi kwenzekani.
Probably many should not.	Mhlawumbe abaningi akufanele.
No deaths occurred.	Akukho ukufa okwenzeka.
Nothing is happening in my area.	Akukho okwenzekayo endaweni yami.
He would never go back.	Wayengeke aphinde ahambe ngemuva.
He asked for his help.	Wacela usizo lwakhe.
It may be best to stay for a while.	Kungaba ngcono ukuhlala isikhashana.
He told me what he wanted me to do.	Wangitshela ukuthi ufuna ngenzeni.
But right now.	Kodwa njengamanje.
He has never driven since.	Akakaze ashayele kusukela lapho.
Not so either, either.	Akunjalo noma, noma.
I suspect the worst.	Ngisola okubi kakhulu.
You must be planning to get married.	Kumele ngabe uhlela ukushada.
But not after all else.	Kodwa hhayi ngemva kwakho konke okunye.
And about this.	Futhi ngalokhu.
That's my big thing.	Into yami enkulu leyo.
First of all, it is difficult to read.	Okokuqala, kunzima ukufunda.
I wanted to tell everyone tonight.	Bengifuna ukutshela wonke umuntu kusihlwa.
We have to get better.	Kuzomele sibe ngcono.
And he is definitely not at home.	Futhi akekho ekhaya nakanjani.
We should all be there.	Sonke kufanele sibe lapho.
He obviously did not know.	Kusobala ukuthi wayengazi.
I don’t know what’s wrong with the job.	Angazi ukuthi yini engalungile ngomsebenzi.
I try to stay.	Ngizama ukuhlala.
Really bad place !.	Indawo embi ngempela!.
Only that will not be that.	Kuphela ukuthi ngeke kube lokho.
Without me, no one knows.	Ngaphandle kwami, akekho owaziyo.
Even flowers are sometimes a great idea.	Ngisho izimbali ngezinye izikhathi umqondo omkhulu.
You do not even have to leave home.	Awudingi nokuthi uhambe ekhaya.
To be with you.	Ukuba nawe.
I can't do it tomorrow.	Angikwazi ukwenza kusasa.
And maybe do some other things too.	Futhi mhlawumbe wenze ezinye izinto futhi.
I never thought he was willing.	Angikaze ngicabange ukuthi uzimisele.
Probably so.	Cishe kunjalo.
He didn't want to be with her.	Wayengafuni ukuba naye.
Not at first though.	Hhayi ekuqaleni noma kunjalo.
Suddenly, he knew.	Ngokushesha, wayazi.
Obviously, something happened.	Ngokusobala, kukhona okwenzekile.
You need strength for that.	Udinga amandla ngalokho.
He asked if anyone else was there.	Wabuza ukuthi ukhona yini omunye.
He is almost out of the house.	Cishe akekho ekhaya.
My need for you.	Isidingo sami ngawe.
Everything else is not necessary.	Konke okunye akudingekile.
It's time for that.	Sekuyisikhathi sokuthi .
As hard as you like.	Njengoba kunzima njengoba uthanda.
He did, but he was not.	Wakwenza, kodwa engekho.
He simplifies our work on the floor.	Wenza lula umsebenzi wethu phansi.
But you promised.	Kodwa nawe wathembisa.
I could not figure out what to do.	Angikwazanga ukuthola ukuthi ngenzeni.
This is sometimes true.	Lokhu kuyiqiniso ngezinye izikhathi.
It has been him.	Kube nguye.
That is not our way.	Akuyona indlela yethu leyo.
I need to sing a lot.	Ngidinga ukucula kakhulu.
There is almost nothing at this time, he thought.	Cishe akukho lutho ngalesi sikhathi, wacabanga.
So, that's really good.	Ngakho, lokho kuhle ngempela.
Good for you ?.	Kuhle kuwe?.
Okay, but not all.	Kulungile, kodwa hhayi konke.
You should have known by now.	Bekumele ngabe uyazi manje.
He told me that I had found a new friend.	Wangitshela ukuthi ngithole umngane omusha.
Yes, but that's fine.	Yebo, kodwa lokho kulungile.
But that is not true.	Kodwa akulona iqiniso lelo.
I also received a message.	Nami ngithole umlayezo.
See you there only once.	Ukubona lapho isikhathi esisodwa kuphela.
Until we do that.	Kuze sikwenze lokho.
I think it has been very difficult.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kube nzima kakhulu.
I know one gun.	Ngiyazi isibhamu esisodwa.
He wanted to know everything.	Wayefuna ukwazi ngakho konke.
I hope your new job will go well.	Ngethemba ukuthi umsebenzi wakho omusha uzohamba kahle.
I want to know, not death.	Ngifuna ukwazi, hhayi ukufa.
But apparently, something happened.	Kodwa ngokusobala, kukhona okwenzekayo.
You know, dog.	Uyazi, inja.
Sometimes no.	Ngezinye izikhathi akukho.
He said no, he did not want to eat.	Wathi cha, akafuni ukudla.
Not even close, absolutely.	Hhayi ngisho eduze, ngokuphelele.
Why he wants to sleep in his place.	Kungani efuna ukulala endaweni yakhe.
He did not need his help.	Wayengafuni usizo lwakhe.
He wondered what it was.	Wazibuza ukuthi ngabe yini.
Sounds like a power to me !.	Kuzwakala sengathi amandla kimi!.
That's it on your desk.	Yilokho lapho etafuleni lakho.
But, you have to stay.	Kodwa, kufanele uhlale.
He knew what must have happened to him now.	Wayazi ukuthi kumele ngabe kwenzekani kuye manje.
I thought you were.	Bengicabanga ukuthi wena .
I'm really sorry about that.	Ngiyaxolisa ngempela ngalokho.
And she is absolutely beautiful.	Futhi muhle ngokuphelele.
More information is needed.	Kudingeka ukufunda okwengeziwe.
You will probably go.	Cishe uzohamba.
You are probably a man.	Cishe uyindoda.
He saw that he would never leave now.	Wabona ukuthi akasoze ahambe manje.
I was not thinking very well.	Bengingacabangi kahle kakhulu.
And this time you say that.	Futhi kulokhu usho lokho.
He did not want to hear the truth.	Wayengafuni ukuzwa iqiniso.
Because that's the thing.	Ngoba yilokho into.
So let me talk.	Ngakho ake ngikhulume.
Thank you for doing so.	Ngiyabonga ngokwenza kanjalo.
My only son always.	Indodana yami kuphela njalo nje.
It would be easy to spend the whole day here.	Kungaba lula ukuchitha usuku lonke lapha.
Indeed, it should.	Ngempela, kufanele.
Not his people, not anyone.	Hhayi abantu bakhe, hhayi noma ubani.
Let's go everywhere.	Ake uhambe yonke indawo.
My mother stayed home.	Umama wahlala ekhaya.
I will leave soon.	Ngizohamba ngokushesha.
He obviously wanted to go down.	Ngokusobala wayefuna ukuya phansi.
But it is all true.	Kodwa konke kuyiqiniso.
Staying for now.	Ukuhlala okwamanje.
All the time, really.	Ngaso sonke isikhathi, ngempela.
But still that is not the whole story.	Kodwa noma kunjalo akuyona yonke indaba.
Sleep most of the time.	Ukulala isikhathi esiningi.
I have become very stupid.	Ngibe isilima kakhulu.
He says that's not true.	Uthi lokho akulona iqiniso.
He heard his name.	Wezwa igama lakhe.
There is only one thing wrong with him.	Kuphela kunento eyodwa engalungile ngaye.
He did it from college.	Ukwenze kusukela ekolishi.
And it happens sometimes.	Futhi kwenzeka ngezinye izikhathi.
I'm a little excited about this.	Ngijabule kancane ngalokhu.
I got in trouble though.	Ngifike enkingeni kodwa.
But for now, that's all.	Kodwa okwamanje, yilokho kuphela.
From everywhere at once.	Kusukela yonke indawo ngesikhathi esisodwa.
And really do it all perfectly.	Futhi ngempela ukwenza konke ngokuphelele.
We can't say the other way.	Asikwazi ukusho enye indlela.
The view here is good.	Umbono lapha muhle.
I think a lot of all this.	Ngicabanga kakhulu ngakho konke lokhu.
Maybe you should go.	Mhlawumbe kufanele uhambe.
I need your help to make my choice.	Ngidinga usizo lwakho ukuze ngenze ukukhetha kwami.
But you do not really know that.	Kodwa awukwazi ngempela lokho.
Nothing really bad.	Akukho okubi ngempela.
He's such a good boy.	Ungumfana omuhle kanje.
She is good enough.	Muhle ngokwanele.
He will not know.	Ngeke azi.
Ake! 	Ake!
First to me now and then.	Okokuqala kimi manje futhi.
He agreed.	Wavuma yini .
His eyes make it happen.	Amehlo akhe akwenza kwenzeke.
I have to hear first of all about that.	Kumele ngizwe kuqala ngakho konke lokho.
It does not appear to exist.	Kubonakala sengathi akekho.
He speaks well.	Ukhuluma kahle.
As I try to help the family.	Njengoba ngizama ukusiza umndeni.
Excellent coffee, too.	Ikhofi elihle kakhulu, futhi.
But your whole family.	Kodwa umndeni wakho wonke.
Yes, he is sleeping.	Yebo, ulele.
He says a good person is young.	Uthi muhle umuntu esemncane.
Obviously he can.	Ngokusobala angakwazi.
I did not want her to know.	Ngangingafuni ukuthi azi.
But that does not always mean that.	Kodwa akusho njalo lokho.
I've never heard of it myself.	Angikaze ngizwe ngakho mina.
You know, the right food.	Uyazi, ukudla okufanele.
I think he knows what to do.	Ngicabanga ukuthi uyakwazi okumele akwenze.
You should be here today.	Kufanele ube lapha namuhla.
That's right, three.	Kunjalo, ezintathu.
But that is not a good thing at all.	Kodwa lokho akuyona into enhle ngempela.
He told me that once and for all.	Wangitshela kanjalo kanye.
You will need to find out more.	Kuzodingeka uthole okunye.
Thus, death is said to be no problem.	Ngakho, ukufa kuthiwa akuyona inkinga.
I never knew this.	Angikaze ngikwazi lokhu.
My girlfriend, a good friend, and me.	Intombi yami, umngane omuhle, kanye nami.
I tried to make sense of it.	Ngazama ukwenza umqondo ngakho.
But he can very well do it all.	Kodwa angakwazi kakhulu ukukwenza konke.
I think everyone did a good job.	Ngicabanga ukuthi wonke umuntu wenze umsebenzi omuhle.
No matter what anyone says.	Noma ngabe wonke umuntu uthini.
Indeed, in this case.	Ngempela, kulokhu.
But not money.	Kodwa hhayi imali.
Let me bring you home.	Ake ngize nawe ekhaya.
I have not been able to purchase a new one just yet.	Angikwazanga ukuthenga entsha okwamanje.
And not just any story.	Futhi hhayi nje noma iyiphi indaba.
Not just children, but children, many.	Hhayi nje izingane, kodwa izingane, eziningi.
Tell me more about it.	Ngitshele okwengeziwe ngayo.
We are doing very well now.	Senza kahle kakhulu manje.
I know you want to know.	Ngiyazi ukuthi ufuna ukwazi.
And apparently, everyone knows that.	Futhi ngokusobala, wonke umuntu uyakwazi lokho.
or.	noma.
Why, he couldn't really say.	Ngani, akakwazanga ngempela ukusho.
I need to know how that happened.	Ngidinga ukwazi ukuthi lokho kwenzeka kanjani.
He should be here, absolutely here.	Kufanele abe lapha, ngokuphelele lapha.
And you can't think that, either.	Futhi awukwazi ukucabanga kanjalo, nawe.
For the work you have done here.	Ngomsebenzi owenze lapha.
He did not know why now.	Wayengazi ukuthi kungani manje.
Or because it's hard.	Noma ngoba kanzima.
Both of these.	Bobabili kulokhu.
Now we know that to be true.	Manje siyazi ukuthi lokho kuyiqiniso.
I would love to.	Ngingathanda kakhulu.
I think this had to happen.	Ngicabanga ukuthi lokhu kwakudingeka kwenzeke.
The marriage lasted three years.	Umshado wathatha iminyaka emithathu.
That is not your place.	Akuyona indawo yakho leyo.
However, something happened.	Noma kunjalo, kukhona okwenzekile.
We need so many things.	Sidinga izinto eziningi kakhulu.
He plays the guitar.	Udlala isiginci .
I have been thinking this for some time.	Sekunesikhathi ngicabanga lokhu.
He is asleep at night.	Ulele ebusuku.
And no one else wants to get into this.	Futhi akekho omunye ofuna ukungena kulokhu.
Obviously.	Kusobala .
I did this for myself.	Ngenze lokhu kimi.
He heard something else.	Wezwa okunye futhi.
He was not alone.	Akazange abe yedwa.
He did it perfectly.	Wenza ngokuphelele.
No, that one.	Cha, lowo.
He did not want to go with her.	Wayengafuni ukuhamba naye.
Everyone is happy.	Wonke umuntu uyajabula.
He wanted more from her.	Wayefuna okwengeziwe kuye.
He did not want to drink alone.	Wayengafuni ukuphuza yedwa.
I'm not sure he'll come back for this.	Anginaso isiqiniseko sokuthi uzobuya kulokhu.
There is no place here.	Ayikho indawo lapha.
It's all up to you.	Konke nguwe.
And we will not have that.	Futhi ngeke sibe nakho lokho.
There is nothing but you.	Akukho lutho ngaphandle kwakho.
How long will it take.	Kuzothatha isikhathi esingakanani.
He looked at the book.	Wabuka incwadi.
You need to do it all.	Udinga ukuzenza zonke.
We need strength.	Sidinga amandla.
No one knows what to do with him.	Akekho owaziyo ukuthi enzeni ngaye.
Without you I would not exist.	Ngaphandle kwakho angeke ngibe khona mina.
And, of course, of course.	Futhi, kunjalo, kunjalo.
But obviously, it should be.	Kodwa ngokusobala, kufanele kube njalo.
I did not see anything for the first time.	Angizange ngibone lutho okokuqala.
Or tell someone else about it.	Noma utshele omunye umuntu ngakho.
Nothing is happening now.	Akukho okwenzekayo manje.
I did not wait long.	Angizange ngilinde isikhathi eside.
He did the worst thing to you.	Wenza okubi kakhulu kuwe.
And she is happy, now.	Futhi uyajabula, manje.
He looked anyway.	Wabuka noma kunjalo.
No one else knows about it.	Akekho omunye owaziyo ngakho.
We need something more.	Sidinga okuthile okwengeziwe.
But no, you are wrong.	Kodwa cha, unephutha.
Maybe we made a mistake.	Mhlawumbe senze iphutha.
Of course it is almost.	Yebo kunjalo ukuthi cishe.
Everything was clear.	Kwacaca konke.
And mom? 	Futhi umama?
I was thinking like you.	Bengicabanga njengawe.
Later a few more.	Kamuva ezinye ezimbalwa.
He knew he had to.	Wayazi ukuthi kufanele.
Instead, he left.	Kunalokho, wahamba.
Anything but nothing.	Noma yini kodwa lutho.
You want to get out of there.	Ufuna ukuphuma lapho.
I've done it all before.	Ngikwenze konke ngaphambili.
Not so either.	Akunjalo noma kunjalo.
His water.	Amanzi akhe.
I wish he hadn't.	Ngifisa sengathi ngabe wayengekho.
But the other is not walking in the park again.	Kodwa okunye akukhona ukuhamba epaki futhi.
From then on he came every day.	Kusukela lapho weza zonke izinsuku.
And he seemed to know a lot.	Futhi wayebonakala ukuthi wazi okuningi.
And that's all.	Futhi konke kunjalo.
I think you should be better at that.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kufanele ube ngcono kulokho.
I know that to me that means nothing to you.	Ngiyazi ukuthi kimi lokho akusho lutho kuwe.
We can't stop now.	Asikwazi ukuyeka manje.
And he didn't, of course.	Futhi akazange, kunjalo.
It may be necessary.	Kungase kudingeke .
Something must have happened.	Kumele ukuthi kukhona okwenzekayo.
His thinking, too.	Ukucabanga kwakhe, futhi.
It could be everything to him.	Kungase kube konke kuye.
At least not soon.	Okungenani hhayi maduze nje.
Then you.	Ngaleso sikhathi wena.
I hope someone can be helpful.	Ngethemba ukuthi othile angaba usizo.
I'm trying to find one.	Ngizama ukuthola eyodwa.
You need my opinion.	Udinga umbono wami.
He never really talked to me.	Akazange akhulume nami ngempela.
Not everyone.	Akuwona wonke umuntu.
For me, then.	Kimi, ngaleso sikhathi.
He knew all about it.	Wayazi konke ngakho.
I could not say the date.	Angikwazanga ukusho usuku.
It started a few years ago.	Waqala eminyakeni embalwa edlule.
He had to be there.	Kwakufanele abe khona.
So that's exactly right.	Ngakho kunjalo impela.
But you can't walk.	Kodwa awukwazi ukuhamba.
It's time for me to speak.	Sekuyisikhathi sokuthi ngikhulume.
You should get pictures.	Kufanele uthole izithombe.
He wasn't sure he did that.	Wayengenaso isiqiniseko sokuthi ukwenzile lokho.
Every year a little.	Njalo ngonyaka kancane.
And he did not want to buy.	Futhi wayengafuni ukuthenga.
Maybe not, but maybe.	Mhlawumbe akunjalo, kodwa mhlawumbe.
He made a noise.	Wenza umsindo.
It never was.	Akuzange kube nhlobo.
And he wanted to get home.	Futhi wayefuna ukufika ekhaya.
Really, he did not know how.	Ngempela, wayengazi ukuthi kanjani.
It's not his money.	Akuyona imali yakhe.
I wanted to see all of this.	Ngangifuna ukukubona konke lokhu.
He said he wanted the truth.	Wathi ufuna iqiniso.
A few hours, at least.	Amahora ambalwa, okungenani.
He would like that to happen.	Angathanda ukuthi lokho kwenzeke.
This way I will do it.	Ngale ndlela ngizokwenza.
But, that doesn't mean much.	Kodwa, lokho akusho okuningi.
I can't get my mind on that.	Angikwazi ukuthola umqondo wami kulokho.
Have you ever thought that you got more?	Wake wacabanga ukuthi uthole okwengeziwe.
Or maybe just one.	Noma mhlawumbe eyodwa nje.
He tried to get help.	Wazama ukuthola usizo.

Is he ?.	Ingabe yena?.
Too much, he knew, but still.	Okuningi kakhulu, wayazi, kodwa noma kunjalo.
Or at least, he would like to.	Noma okungenani, angathanda.
We never became friends.	Asizange sibe abangane.
Maybe he wanted to help.	Mhlawumbe wayefuna ukusiza.
You should go and be happy.	Kufanele uhambe ujabule.
But he did not need to know that.	Kodwa kwakungadingeki akwazi lokho.
He should definitely go.	Kufanele nakanjani ahambe.
But you can't just get in.	Kodwa awukwazi ukungena nje.
I need to get out of town.	Ngidinga ukuphuma edolobheni.
Her father did her best.	Ubaba wakhe wenza konke okusemandleni akhe.
My children, he thought.	Izingane zami, wacabanga.
She is not in her room, she is not in her room.	Akekho ekamelweni lakhe, akekho ekamelweni lakhe.
Maybe he did too.	Mhlawumbe naye wakwenza.
He knows enough.	Wazi ngokwanele.
Maybe he shouldn't have been out here.	Mhlawumbe bekungafanele abe lapha ngaphandle.
Yes, he is a good boy.	Yebo, ungumfana omuhle.
You are here to get my opinion.	Ulapha ukuze uthole umbono wami.
But it is not everywhere.	Kodwa akuyona neze yonke indawo.
So, that's my new thing.	Ngakho, into yami entsha leyo.
I'm not sure if that's true.	Anginaso isiqiniseko sokuthi lokho kuyiqiniso yini.
She seemed really happy.	Wayebonakala ejabule ngempela.
He stayed there for three days.	Wahlala izinsuku ezintathu lapho.
You want a photo.	Ufuna isithombe.
You can't make a mistake in the background.	Awukwazi ukwenza iphutha ngemuva.
She had to help him.	Kwadingeka amsize.
He lives next to me.	Uhlala eduze kwami.
He works late in the office.	Usebenza kade ehhovisi.
He longs to see you more.	Ufisa ukukubona kakhulu.
But is that true ?.	Kodwa kuyiqiniso lokho?.
He could not do anything right.	Akakwazanga ukwenza lutho kahle.
And maybe he didn't.	Futhi mhlawumbe akazange.
There is no one else around.	Akekho omunye umuntu eduze.
Or at least you should be.	Noma okungenani kufanele ube.
You feel when you need or want.	Uzizwa lapho udinga noma ufuna.
This is our thing.	Into yethu lena.
This is not a big deal for him.	Lokhu akuyona into enkulu kuye.
But it means a lot of time.	Kodwa okushiwo kakhulu isikhathi.
He gave things.	Wanikeza izinto.
I am the right one.	Yimina okufanele .
He agreed to stay.	Wavuma ukuhlala.
No, it should not be.	Cha, akufanele kube njalo.
It doesn't have to be one thing, time.	Akufanele sibe yinto eyodwa, isikhathi.
He thinks about it for a few days.	Ucabanga ngakho izinsuku ezimbalwa.
He wanted to know what had happened.	Wayefuna ukwazi ukuthi kwenzekeni.
They didn't know much about him.	Bengazi kakhulu ngaye.
His name, he thought.	Igama lakhe, wacabanga.
My mother came out.	Umama waphuma.
He told me what he wanted to do.	Wangitshela ukuthi wayefuna ukwenzani.
Right here at least.	Khona lapha okungenani.
He promised to be back soon.	Wathembisa ukuthi uzobuya maduze.
But now he kept thinking.	Kodwa manje wahlala wacabanga.
We found one.	Sithole eyodwa.
There is no repair or repair.	Akukho ukulungisa noma ukulungisa.
Bad! 	Okubi!
It should be okay.	Kufanele kube kulungile.
I tried, once.	Ngazama, kanye.
You can do what you have to do.	Uyakwazi ukwenza lokho okufanele ukwenze.
But this time he made a big mistake.	Kodwa kulokhu wenza iphutha elikhulu.
But he did not want to leave immediately.	Kodwa wayengafuni ukuhamba ngokushesha.
He said he did.	Wathi wenze njalo.
There is a shop nearby.	Kukhona ukuthenga eduze.
The doctor was surprised.	Wamangala udokotela.
He did not want to hear anything.	Wayengafuni ukuzwa lutho.
Or your name.	Noma igama lakho.
One that all is always right.	Omunye ukuthi konke kulungile njalo.
I've been able to.	Kade ngikwazi.
Very well.	Kahle kahle.
I don’t want to see more.	Angifuni ukubona okwengeziwe.
He thought it was time.	Wayecabanga ukuthi sekuyisikhathi.
He spoke for days.	Wakhuluma izinsuku.
I don't think you should do that.	Angicabangi ukuthi kufanele ukwenze lokho.
There are many now.	Kukhona abaningi manje.
Or I'm totally happy.	Noma ngijabule ngokuphelele.
This is a very small book.	Lena incwadi encane kakhulu.
I need to know about this.	Kufanele ngazi ngalokhu.
He did nothing for her.	Akazange enze lutho ngaye.
He walked in the door.	Wangena emnyango.
The way he did it, he probably did it too.	Indlela enza ngayo, kungenzeka ukuthi naye ukwenzile.
I never thought of it, you know.	Angizange ngicabange lutho ngakho, uyazi.
But I will just go to my house for now.	Kodwa ngizohamba nje endlini yami okwamanje.
Someone can do it.	Kukhona umuntu angakwenza.
And maybe thank you for that, finally.	Futhi mhlawumbe ngiyabonga ngakho, ekugcineni.
Just walking around the area.	Ukuhamba nje endaweni.
And finally, they said yes.	Futhi ekugcineni, bathi yebo.
And well! 	Futhi kahle!
Maybe you should consider food here.	Mhlawumbe kufanele ucabange ukudla lapha.
He just thought it best to talk a little.	Wavele wacabanga ukuthi kungcono akhulume kancane.
I probably tried very hard.	Cishe ngazama kakhulu.
You may like that.	Ungathanda lokho.
I should have been there.	Bekufanele ngibe khona.
That is my story.	Indaba yami leyo.
My mother or father died.	Umama noma ubaba washona.
Maybe that's you.	Mhlawumbe nguwe lowo.
Or he wanted to.	Noma wayefuna.
I wanted to go to school.	Ngangifuna ukuya esikoleni.
He could not find strength anywhere.	Akakwazanga ukuthola amandla noma kuphi.
Vision vision.	Umbono umbono.
I would not do this.	Bengingeke ngikwenze lokhu.
Well, that's not true.	Kulungile, lokho akulona iqiniso.
I felt the same thing.	Ngezwa into efanayo.
You know you're scared to get out, you need time.	Uyazi wesaba ukuphuma, udinga isikhathi.
If you expect to get better, you will get better.	Uma ulindele ukuba ngcono, uzoba ngcono.
I'm really sorry to hear that.	Ngiyaxolisa ngempela ukuzwa.
You cannot say it all at once.	Awukwazi ukusho konke ngesikhathi esisodwa.
We need the whole universe.	Sidinga indawo yonke.
You know you've thought about this.	Uyazi ukuthi uke wacabanga ngalokhu.
Nothing to speak of at all.	Ayikho into ekhuluma ngakho nhlobo.
Tell me again how it happened.	Ngitshele futhi ukuthi kwenzeke kanjani.
He was thinking hard now.	Wayecabanga kanzima manje.
Such a big child.	Ingane enkulu kangaka.
When you play football.	Uma udlala ibhola .
You just need to know where and how to look.	Udinga nje ukwazi ukuthi ubonakala kuphi futhi kanjani.
In this.	Kulokhu .
We need to get out.	Sidinga ukuphuma.
But he did not say.	Kodwa akazange asho.
That's exactly what he told me.	Empeleni yilokho angitshele khona.
Finally, he left.	Ekugcineni, wahamba.
Doing things from the beginning.	Ukwenza izinto kusukela ekuqaleni.
To tell you that.	Ukukutshela lokho.
I wasn’t thinking too much in between.	Bengingacabangi kakhulu phakathi.
You do not need to die.	Awudingi ukufa.
But I do not like it.	Kodwa angikuthandi.
I have never heard of it before.	Angikaze ngizwe ngaphambili.
He made his time.	Wenza isikhathi sakhe.
I blame the parents for this.	Ngisola abazali ngalokhu.
I should have been.	Bekufanele ngibe .
I thought there was no such thing.	Ngangicabanga ukuthi ayikho into enjalo.
And it was wrong.	Futhi kwakungafanele.
But it is not here.	Kodwa akukho lapha.
My age.	Iminyaka yami.
You want money.	Uwena ofuna imali.
But imagine that there are three now.	Kodwa ake ucabange ukuthi kukhona ezintathu manje.
But, one problem is not small.	Kodwa, inkinga eyodwa akuyona encane.
In fact, we did not.	Empeleni, asizange.
No, I mean this is not all.	Cha, ngisho lokhu akukhona konke.
I wanted to have sex with her.	Ngangifuna ukulala naye.
It would be nice to have a family.	Kungaba kuhle ukuba nomndeni.
At the moment he did not know how long.	Okwamanje wayengazi ukuthi kuze kube nini.
Getting home would be great.	Ukufika ekhaya kungaba kuhle.
I'm so sorry to hear that.	Ngiyaxolisa kakhulu ukuzwa lokho.
I don't have to know everything.	Akumele ngazi konke.
But, it looks okay.	Kodwa, kubukeka kulungile.
The spirit is real.	Umoya ukhona ngempela.
And he spoke some.	Futhi wakhuluma ezinye.
Also, he did not do that.	Futhi, akakwenzanga lokho.
And for us.	Futhi kithi.
He also speaks to himself.	Aphinde akhulume yedwa.
What will happen to you.	Kuzoba yini ngawe.
Slight death.	Ukufa kancane.
But he will come in the evening.	Kodwa uzofika kusihlwa.
He would get much better.	Wayezoba ngcono kakhulu.
Just a bad person.	Umuntu omubi nje.
I would like to hear what you have to say.	Ngingathanda ukuzwa ukuthi uthini.
Please, thank you.	Ngicela, ngiyabonga.
I'm sorry to come in.	Ngiyaxolisa ukungena.
But there was an error.	Kodwa kube khona iphutha.
But that is just talk.	Kodwa lokho ukukhuluma nje.
You should know better than that right now.	Kufanele wazi kangcono kunalokho okwamanje.
Always both together.	Njalo bobabili ndawonye.
So that had to happen first.	Ngakho lokho kwakufanele kwenzeke kuqala.
This is much more difficult than it first appears.	Lokhu kunzima kakhulu kunalokho kubonakala ekuqaleni.
He really thought so.	Wacabanga kanjalo ngempela.
Long, few days.	Isikhathi eside, izinsuku ezimbalwa.
He always works.	Usebenza njalo.
He wanted to travel a lot or go home.	Wayefuna ukuhamba kakhulu noma aye ekhaya.
One just didn’t.	Omunye akazange nje.
But that is exactly what another boy did.	Kodwa yilokho kanye okwenziwa omunye umfana.
Bad.	Omubi.
But no, not her mother.	Kodwa cha, hhayi umama wakhe.
It doesn't have to be.	Akudingekile ukuba.
I can't always say that.	Ngeke ngikwazi njalo ukusho lokho.
She comes and sits next to him on the bed.	Afike ahlale eduze kwakhe embhedeni.
There has been death.	Kube khona ukufa.
In the end, he is a man.	Ekugcineni, uyindoda.
I wish you were here with us.	Ngifisa sengathi ngabe ulapha nathi.
No stopping happened.	Akukho ukuyeka okwenzekile.
I was thinking though.	Bengicabanga kodwa.
Next week, next month, but not later.	Ngesonto elizayo, ngenyanga ezayo, kodwa hhayi kamuva.
I wanted to get in.	Bengifuna ukungena phakathi.
A child can be easy to see.	Ingane kungaba lula ukubona.
Because he was not.	Ngoba wayengekho.
Nothing happens to that.	Akukho okwenzekayo kulokho.
Not a bad beer.	Hhayi ubhiya omubi.
Not your teacher.	Hhayi uthisha wakho.
I want you to think about that.	Ngifuna ucabange ngalokho.
Me and you and him.	Mina nawe kanye naye.
That's your thing.	Into yakho leyo.
No, we should definitely do that.	Cha, kufanele sikwenze lokho nakanjani.
Can anyone please tell me what is wrong.	Ingabe ukhona ngicela angitshele ukuthi yini engalungile.
I will be there alone.	Ngizoba lapho ngedwa.
No, that's fine.	Cha, lokho kulungile.
He did not want to live.	Wayengafuni ukuphila.
So in the office, and he stayed all morning.	Ngakho ehhovisi, futhi wahlala ekuseni yonke.
Some money.	Enye imali.
He needed to create an opportunity.	Kwakudingeka akhe ithuba.
Finally, he got an idea.	Ekugcineni, wathola umqondo.
Not your name, nothing.	Akulona igama lakho, lutho.
You will get better with it.	Uzoba ngcono ngakho.
Very good, actually.	Kuhle kakhulu, empeleni.
So performance should already be there.	Ngakho ukusebenza kufanele kube khona kakade.
I talk to him all the time.	Ngikhuluma naye ngaso sonke isikhathi.
But he will not do that.	Kodwa ngeke akwenze lokho.
Well, thank you.	Kuhle, ngiyabonga.
Sounds difficult today.	Kuzwakala kunzima namuhla.
I hope you are feeling well today ?.	Ngethemba ukuthi uzizwa kahle namuhla?.
Or you are a child.	Noma uyingane.
I don't think it will be good.	Angicabangi ukuthi kuzoba kuhle.
He may not do that.	Angase angakwenzi lokho.
You have been working here for a long time.	Unesikhathi eside usebenza lapha.
Do not forget to eat.	Ungakhohlwa ukudla.
He knew everything about me.	Wayazi konke ngami.
He hurried out of the house.	Waphuma ngokushesha endlini.
He left and did not know where it was.	Wahamba futhi wayengazi ukuthi kuphi.
And he would not go anywhere.	Futhi wayengeke ahambe ndawo.
But maybe not as much as you.	Kodwa mhlawumbe hhayi kakhulu njengawe.
Come with you.	Weza nawe.
I will do something for the rest of my life.	Ngizokwenza okuthile impilo yami yonke.
Obviously, this is not necessary.	Ngokusobala, lokhu akudingekile.
She looks exactly like him.	Ufana naye kahle.
Or at least it should be there.	Noma okungenani kufanele kube khona.
Maybe you would like to be there.	Mhlawumbe ungathanda ukuba khona.
I think he thought it would be good for him.	Ngicabanga ukuthi wayecabanga ukuthi kungaba kuhle kuye.
You'd better go for a while.	Kungcono uhambe isikhashana.
Yes this will happen, as soon as possible.	Yebo lokhu kuzokwenzeka, ngokushesha ngangokunokwenzeka.
You may have done this anyway.	Kungenzeka ukuthi ukwenzile lokhu noma kunjalo.
You do this every day.	Lokhu ukwenza nsuku zonke.
I did not want her to be alone.	Ngangingafuni ukuthi abe yedwa.
Not now .	Hhayi manje .
He is in my world.	Ukhona emhlabeni wami.
In fact he never said that.	Empeleni akakaze akusho lokho.
he cannot stay long.	akakwazi ukuhlala isikhathi eside.
But he came a few times.	Kodwa wafika izikhathi ezimbalwa.
He told me everything about himself.	Wangitshela konke ngaye.
This obviously works very slowly.	Lokhu ngokusobala ukusebenza kancane kakhulu.
It was nothing.	Akuzange kube yinto.
It's been too long, now.	Sekuyisikhathi eside kakhulu, manje.
That is your case.	Icala lakho lelo.
Saying this many times.	Ukusho lokhu izikhathi eziningi.
Or really years.	Noma ngempela iminyaka.
And for a week.	Futhi ngesonto.
That's almost a long shot.	Lokho cishe isibhamu eside.
For a while he stayed there.	Isikhashana wahlala lapho.
Please be it.	Ngicela kube nguye.
But in the end it is true.	Kodwa ekugcineni kuyiqiniso.
Actually a long time.	Empeleni isikhathi eside.
At least, that's what people say.	Okungenani, yilokho okushiwo abantu.
I'm not sure where and when.	Angiqiniseki ukuthi kuphi futhi nini.
You're kidding me.	Udlala ngami.
I thought about buying a new car.	Ngicabange ukuthenga imoto entsha.
A real gun.	Isibhamu impela.
But more was needed.	Kodwa kwakudingeka okwengeziwe.
It's good to see you looking good.	Kuhle ukukubona ubukeka kahle.
Only to make you be alone.	Kuphela ukwenza ube khona wedwa.
He could not do his job on time.	Wayengeke enze umsebenzi wakhe ngesikhathi.
I just want to see what happens.	Ngifuna nje ukubona ukuthi kwenzekani.
You have to do something you think you can't do.	Kufanele wenze into ocabanga ukuthi ngeke ukwazi ukuyenza.
If that's okay with you.	Uma lokho kulungile nawe.
A nice dinner.	Isidlo sakusihlwa esihle.
But you can't stay there.	Kodwa awukwazi ukuhlala lapho.
Most of the time the food is okay.	Isikhathi esiningi ukudla kulungile.
I'll go home with you.	Ngizohamba nawe ngiye ekhaya.
I will do this completely again.	Ngizokwenza lokhu ngokuphelele futhi.
Obviously, our father made a mistake.	Kusobala ubaba wethu wenza iphutha.
Maybe there are other things.	Mhlawumbe kukhona ezinye izinto.
That should not happen in this case.	Lokho akumele kwenzeke kulokhu.
As you will.	Njengoba uzokwenza.
It's hard to imagine how.	Kunzima ukucabanga kanjani.
We do that all the time.	Senza lokho ngaso sonke isikhathi.
Of course no one.	Yebo akekho umuntu.
He can't help it.	Akakwazi ukusiza.
It better be there.	Kungcono kube khona.
Stop talking and do something.	Yeka ukukhuluma wenze okuthile.
Not so for me.	Akunjalo kimi.
If he does, it is possible.	Uma enza lokho, kungenzeka nje.
And you think a lot.	Futhi ucabanga kakhulu.
So thank you for that !.	Ngakho ngiyabonga ngalokho!.
Man is much better.	Umuntu ungcono kakhulu.
And make your message.	Futhi wenze umlayezo wakho.
Now, you should stay here.	Manje, kufanele uhlale lapha.
I could not do.	angikwazanga ukwenza.
I'm not sure where.	Angazi kahle ukuthi kuphi.
But not without him.	Kodwa hhayi ngaphandle kwakhe.
It is very difficult to sleep at night.	Kunzima kakhulu ukulala ebusuku.
Maybe only three.	Mhlawumbe ezintathu kuphela.
Whenever you like.	Noma nini lapho uthanda.
I want to hear this right now.	Ngifuna ukuzwa lokhu njengamanje.
Only one problem.	Inkinga eyodwa kuphela .
He looked really bad.	Wayebukeka kabi impela.
It could certainly be his money.	Impela kungenzeka imali yakhe.
That's what we have to do this week.	Yilokho okumele sikwenze kuleli sonto.
And you can do that.	Futhi ungakwenza lokho.
Just me .	Mina nje .
But you can't leave right away.	Kodwa awukwazi ukuhamba ngaso leso sikhathi.
It's hard to do that.	Kunzima ukukwenza lokho.
I say every night.	Ngisho njalo ebusuku.
But the work went well.	Kodwa umsebenzi wahamba kahle.
Maybe it will be a fix.	Mhlawumbe kuzoba ukulungisa.
We do our homework.	Senza umsebenzi wethu wesikole.
The doctor arrived in the morning.	Udokotela wafika ekuseni.
But he soon discovered that it was not necessary.	Kodwa ngokushesha wathola ukuthi kwakungadingeki.
No, I heard.	Cha, ngizwe.
But there is something wrong with the job.	Kodwa kukhona into embi emsebenzini.
You should be very happy.	Kufanele ujabule kakhulu.
Or in the morning.	Noma ekuseni.
He is here, and this is it now.	Ulapha, futhi lokhu manje.
Tell me what you mean.	Ngitshele ukuthi usho ukuthini.
But he can't do it.	Kodwa angeke akwenze.
I felt down there.	Ngizwe phansi lapho.
He is also a good student at school.	Ungumfundi omuhle futhi esikoleni.
So he asked a friend.	Ngakho wabuza umngane.
There is no such problem here.	Ayikho inkinga enjalo lapha.
This is actually nothing new.	Lokhu empeleni akuyona into entsha.
The work went quickly.	Umsebenzi wahamba ngokushesha.
I can't do it all.	Angikwazi ukukwenza konke.
At least he's trying to get out of the place.	Okungenani uzama ukuphuma endaweni.
But tell me why.	Kodwa ngitshele ukuthi kungani.
I think you would never know that.	Ngicabanga ukuthi ubungeke ukwazi lokho.
Or maybe you are telling the truth.	Noma mhlawumbe ukhuluma iqiniso.
But we did not make money.	Kodwa asizange senze imali.
Now, he thought, it might be a good time.	Manje, wacabanga, kungase kube isikhathi esihle.
At least not tonight.	Okungenani hhayi namuhla ebusuku.
I wanted to go alone to my room.	Bengifuna ukuhamba ngedwa ekamelweni lami.
That's my opinion anyway.	Lowo umbono wami noma kunjalo.
Everyone will be here soon.	Wonke umuntu uzoba lapha maduze.
So he returned home.	Ngakho wabuyela ekhaya.
Now we need to talk.	Manje sidinga ukukhuluma.
No, one.	Cha, omunye.
To be helpful.	Ukuze ube usizo.
There is probably someone in his office.	Cishe nje ukuthi kukhona othile ehhovisi lakhe.
He committed a crime.	Wenza icala.
But that is what he did.	Kodwa yilokho akwenza.
He knew what it looked like.	Wayazi ukuthi kubukeka kanjani.
He came to my house.	Wafika endlini yami.
And this is not the place to do it.	Futhi lena akuyona indawo yokwenza.
He left in the afternoon.	Wahamba ntambama.
You do not have to stay close.	Asikho isidingo sokuthi uhlale eduze.
He is the One who made it all possible.	Uyena owenza konke kwenzeke.
In practice you need to learn.	Ngokwenza udinga ukufunda.
First it just works.	Okokuqala ukusebenza nje.
It had to be done.	Bekufanele kwenziwe.
That will be easy to do.	Lokho kuzoba lula ukukwenza.
They are not the police.	Akuwona amaphoyisa.
Thank you for this.	Ngiyabonga ngalokhu.
A case was needed.	Kwakudingeka icala.
He came to my room.	Weza ekamelweni lami.
He had to help.	Kwadingeka asize.
He should not have stayed here.	Bekungafanele ahlale lapha.
He does not want us to be together.	Akathandi ukuthi sibe ndawonye.
Such a talented guy.	Umfana onekhono kangaka.
He wants it to happen again.	Ufuna kwenzeke futhi.
I've never been there enough.	Angikaze ngibe lapho ngokwanele.
And he came here.	Futhi weza lapha.
He has already done it.	Usevele wakwenza.
At first, at least.	Ekuqaleni, okungenani.
Stop talking as if you know what you are talking about.	Yeka ukukhuluma sengathi uyazi ukuthi ukhuluma ngani.
His mother died.	Umama wakhe washona.
He should never do it.	Akufanele neze akwenze.
He too wanted nothing.	Naye wayengafuni lutho.
Last month.	Ngenyanga edlule.
If you know.	Ukube uyazi.
Good mistake.	Iphutha elihle.
And really now.	Futhi ngempela manje.
It's been a while now.	Sekunesikhathi manje.
Not even a really new approach.	Akuyona ngisho indlela entsha ngempela.
I want it to happen soon.	Ngifuna kwenzeke ngokushesha.
He did this with her in the room.	Wakwenza lokhu naye ekamelweni.
This is the first time for me.	Lokhu okokuqala kimi.
I'm not really sure why that is the case.	Angiqiniseki ngempela ukuthi kungani kunjalo.
He could not see.	Wayengeke akwazi ukubona.
It's time for me.	Sekuyisikhathi kimi.
He had to come to work anyway.	Bekumele eze emsebenzini noma kanjani.
I need to talk.	Ngidinga ukukhuluma.
I want to live that.	Ngifuna ukuphila lokho.
But sometimes, too.	Kodwa ngezinye izikhathi, nathi.
He walks people though.	Uhamba abantu kodwa.
I'm glad you're a friend.	Ngiyajabula ukuthi umngane.
Is that really the case though.	Ingabe kunjalo ngempela kodwa.
But she can't stop crying.	Kodwa akakwazi ukuyeka ukukhala.

How is that ?.	Kanjani lokho?.
Sounds like a good guy to me.	Kubonakala sengathi umfana omuhle kimi.

And now he is coming.	Futhi manje uyeza.
I did not know where it was.	Ngangingazi ukuthi kuphi.
We should not be there.	Akufanele sibe lapho.

In the same way, a doctor can never make a mistake.	Ngendlela efanayo, udokotela akasoze enze iphutha.
You can't think straight.	Awukwazi ukucabanga kahle.
He felt that he had to say something else.	Wabona sengathi kufanele akhulume okunye.
I thought it would never happen.	Ngangicabanga ukuthi ngeke kwenzeke.
I have never heard anything so bad.	Angikaze ngizwe into embi kanje.
He seemed to know everything.	Wabonakala wazi konke.
I couldn’t talk about it at the time.	Angikwazanga ukukhuluma ngakho ngaleso sikhathi.
He didn't want to talk about that now.	Wayengafuni ukukhuluma ngalokho manje.
Across the city.	Edolobheni lonke.
I hope you mean more.	Ngethemba ukuthi usho okunye.
But this must be the case.	Kodwa lokhu kufanele kube njalo.

And, if you like, tell someone about it.	Futhi, uma uthanda, tshela omunye ngakho.
Waiting for the family to make a decision.	Ukulinda umndeni ukuthi wenze isinqumo.

So off he went.	Ngakho wahamba njalo.
I want her to be there.	Ngifuna abe khona.

Lots of thinking.	Ukucabanga okuningi.
These only.	Lezi kuphela.
He would not want you to do that.	Ngeke afune ukuthi wenze lokho.

What a place.	Yeka indawo.
It will not happen unless you make it happen.	Ngeke kwenzeke ngaphandle kokuthi ukwenze kwenzeke.
But we have to make it better now.	Kodwa kufanele sikwenze kube ngcono manje.

All this just.	Konke lokhu nje.
But first, the question.	Kodwa okokuqala, umbuzo.
Maybe later.	Mhlawumbe kamuva.
It's great to have you here.	Kuhle kakhulu ukuba nawe lapha.
He agreed to everything.	Wavuma kukho konke.

Looks like you feel so much better.	Kubukeka sengathi uzizwa ungcono kakhulu.
He will come home.	Uzofika ekhaya.
And maybe that would be great.	Futhi mhlawumbe lokho kungaba kuhle kakhulu.
I could not find his name.	Angikwazanga ukuthola igama lakhe.
That is not a problem for me.	Akuyona inkinga kimi lokho.
And stay that way.	Futhi uhlale kanjalo.
If you like, it will be so.	Uma uthanda, kuzoba njalo.
Certainly not his money.	Impela akuyona imali yakhe.
Or at least to me.	Noma okungenani kimi.
His mother would be.	Umama wakhe wayezoba.
Where is this.	Kuphi lokhu .
Maybe something better.	Mhlawumbe into enhle kangcono.
It’s not a bad job, either.	Akuwona umsebenzi omubi, futhi.
I don't think you need to be that way.	Angicabangi ukuthi udinga ukuba njalo.
Right now it's okay.	Njengamanje kulungile.
Or you ?.	Noma wena?.
I don’t know how to do it, really.	Angazi ukuthi ukwenza kanjani, ngempela.
Not man, he thought.	Hhayi umuntu, wacabanga.
One says one, another says another.	Omunye usho enye, omunye asho enye.
I said you would win.	Bengithi uzowina.
I'm sure.	Ngiyaqiniseka .
Doing my job.	Ukwenza umsebenzi wami.
Sometimes food.	Ngezinye izikhathi ukudla.
We've done it ever since.	Senze njalo kusukela lapho.
He wanted to sleep.	Wayefuna ukulala .
He's trying to think.	Uzama ukucabanga.
I only want to try this once.	Ngifuna ukuzama kanye kuphela lokhu.
Maybe he shouldn’t have done it.	Mhlawumbe bekungafanele akwenze.
Just tell me that.	Ngitshele nje lokho.
He will be leaving soon.	Uzohamba maduze nje.
He saw a little.	Wabona kancane.
He really wanted to go.	Wayefuna ukuhamba ngempela.
He went in with her.	Wangena naye.
You never need to talk to me.	Awudingi nhlobo ukukhuluma nami.
Yes, one knows.	Yebo, umuntu uyazi.
I go times.	Ngiya izikhathi.
Not so obviously.	Akunjalo ngokusobala.
A few things, actually.	Izinto ezimbalwa, empeleni.
You got all the questions right.	Uthole yonke imibuzo kahle.
It will not be easier.	Ngeke kube lula kunalokho.
We found out more.	Sithole okwengeziwe.
Do not forget at all.	Ungakhohlwa nakancane.
I've never done it before, you know.	Angikaze ngikwenze ngaphambili, uyazi.
Who really makes money.	Ubani ngempela owenza imali.
But that is not really the case.	Kodwa akulona iqiniso ngempela.
He lives with us.	Uhlala nathi.
He came in with me.	Wangena nami.
He does not know that you are here.	Akazi ukuthi ulapha.
He too could not do that.	Naye akakwazanga ukukwenza lokho.
Or too high.	Noma phezulu kakhulu.
Every hour in between.	Wonke amahora phakathi.
He does not want anyone.	Akafuni muntu.
Now you really need to do something about this.	Manje udinga ngempela ukwenza okuthile ngalokhu.
No one has to stay here.	Akudingeki ukuthi umuntu ahlale lapha.
Certainly not you.	Impela hhayi kuwe.
There is new money.	Kukhona imali entsha.
Apparently he could not say.	Ngokusobala akakwazanga ukusho.
And no, not at once, of course.	Futhi cha, hhayi ngesikhathi esisodwa, kunjalo.
He knew a lot about it.	Wayazi okuningi ngakho.
He asked for another chance.	Wacela elinye ithuba.
It has been obvious for a long time.	Sekuyisikhathi eside kusobala.
And seeing a son may not be easy.	Futhi ukubona indodana mhlawumbe kungaba nzima.
You are so talented! 	Unekhono kakhulu!
He's just stupid.	Isilima nje.
Dad will be back.	Ubaba uzobuya.
Ride a bike.	Ucabanga ukuthi ubani wena.
It has to be the way.	Kufanele kube indlela.
Death to be with him.	Ukufa ukuba naye.
So he went into his room.	Ngakho wangena ekamelweni lakhe.
For a long time nothing.	Isikhathi eside lutho.
He can be.	Angaba khona.
All this time, he was thinking.	Sonke lesi sikhathi, wayecabanga.
I have been thinking a lot since summer.	Bengicabanga kakhulu kusukela ehlobo.
There is almost.	Kukhona cishe.
Trying to do many things at once.	Ukuzama ukwenza izinto eziningi ngesikhathi esisodwa.
Let me talk to you a little bit.	Ake ngikhulume nawe kancane.
I just want to learn as much as I can.	Ngifuna nje ukufunda okuningi ngangokunokwenzeka.
He, too, would not win.	Naye, ubengeke awine.
And life is everywhere.	Futhi impilo yonke indawo.
At that point he stayed.	Ngaleso sikhathi ehlala.
He can only be with you.	Angaba nawe kuphela.
We have to do it the right way.	Kufanele sikwenze ngendlela efanele.
No wasting time.	Akukho ukuchitha isikhathi.
So there.	Ngakho lapho.
And there is nothing wrong with that.	Futhi akukho okubi.
Or just fine nothing.	Noma kuhle nje lutho.
Being on time.	Ukuba ngesikhathi.
In bed, exactly.	Embhedeni, impela.
This is a good way.	Lena indlela enhle.
That's a good idea.	Umqondo omuhle lowo.
There will be no one but you.	Ngeke kube khona omunye ngaphandle kwakho.
Only for me.	Ngami kuphela.
I'm not sure yet why that happened.	Angiqiniseki okwamanje ukuthi kungani lokho kwenzeka.
Yes, my mother did not want me to leave.	Yebo, umama wayengafuni ngihambe.
It needs to be good.	Kudingeka kube kuhle.
Not coffee.	Akulona ikhofi.
Since last week.	Kusukela ngesonto eledlule.
Not many days, but some.	Hhayi izinsuku eziningi, kodwa ezinye.
You want your photo.	Ufuna isithombe sakho.
He wants you.	Ufuna wena.
I think that's not true.	Ngicabanga ukuthi akulona iqiniso.
I don't really know anything about him.	Angazi lutho ngempela ngaye.
And down.	Futhi phansi.
He will not speak to me.	Ngeke akhulume nami.
Really hard learning.	Ukufunda kanzima ngempela.
Could it be your problem ?.	Kungenzeka yini ukuthi inkinga yakho?.
And who do you want to work with?	Futhi ufuna ukusebenza nobani.
He has always been that way.	Ubelokhu enjalo.
Tell me.	Ngitshele .
He wanted to be the only one, not you.	Wayefuna kube nguye kuphela hhayi wena.
Nothing always seems as it seems.	Akukho lutho njalo njengoba kubonakala.
I did so though.	Ngenza kanjalo kodwa.
You have done a very bad thing.	Wenze into embi kakhulu.
He is not in the world.	Akekho emhlabeni.
It’s hard but there’s no other way for us.	Kunzima kodwa ayikho enye indlela ngathi.
From a young age.	Kusukela esemncane.
I wonder if he can speak.	Ngiyazibuza ukuthi uyakwazi ukukhuluma.
I know it's my fault.	Ngiyazi ukuthi iphutha lami.
All over the world, maybe.	Emhlabeni wonke, mhlawumbe.
I wanted to stay here.	Bengifuna ukuhlala lapha.
He is here alone.	Ulapha yedwa.
She loves the baby.	Uthanda ingane.
I have never heard of him.	Angikaze ngizwe lutho ngaye.
This is solitude.	Lokhu ukuba wedwa.
Again, this is nothing new.	Futhi, lena akuyona into entsha.
But he sat down, a little.	Kodwa wahlala phansi, kancane.
I will not tell anyone.	Ngeke ngitshele omunye.
I could not find a job.	Angikwazanga ukuthola umsebenzi.
He thought only of his father.	Wayecabanga ubaba wakhe kuphela.
I saw that you were thinking too much.	Ngabona ukuthi ucabanga kakhulu.
In one house.	Endlini eyodwa.
Your father told me to go with you.	Ubaba wakho uthe ngihambe nawe.
Yes, everything is fine here.	Yebo, konke kulungile lapha.
You should not really need much more.	Akufanele ngempela udinga okunye okuningi.
I wanted to see why.	Ngangifuna ukubona ukuthi kungani.
That's right but not really.	Kunjalo kodwa hhayi impela.
Indeed, there is no wrong choice.	Ngempela, akukho ukukhetha okubi.
My mind stays out.	Umqondo wami uhlala ngaphandle.
But not so much yet.	Kodwa hhayi kakhulu okwamanje.
His mother should know.	Umama wakhe kuzomele azi.
I always wanted to be human.	Ngihlale ngifuna ukuba umuntu.
Probably not the first time.	Mhlawumbe hhayi okokuqala.
Work late at night.	Umsebenzi ebusuku kakhulu.
Nothing happened to me.	Akukho okwenzeka kimi.
But that doesn't mean you have to be.	Kodwa lokho akusho ukuthi kufanele ube.
But, please tell me the time.	Kodwa, ngicela ungitshele isikhathi.
That is certainly not a bad idea.	Akuwona neze umbono omubi lowo.
But it can be a long time for you.	Kodwa kungaba isikhathi eside kuwe.
She is obviously beautiful.	Muhle ngokusobala.
He’s a very nice and talented guy.	Ungumfana omuhle kakhulu futhi onekhono.
And some days.	Futhi ngezinye izinsuku.
I know about everything.	Ngiyazi ngakho konke.
I never wanted to be like that either.	Nami ngangingafuni neze ukuba njalo.
I said, no.	Ngathi, cha.
One reason, though.	Isizathu esisodwa, noma kunjalo.
I know we did.	Ngiyazi ukuthi senze.
I'm not sure though.	Angiqiniseki kodwa.
I want you behind me all the way.	Ngifuna wena ngemuva kwami ​​yonke indlela.
You should stay in my place.	Kufanele uhlale endaweni yami.
You've been here ever since.	Ube lapha kusukela ngaleso sikhathi.
Not this close.	Hhayi lokhu eduze.
She is very good at it.	Muhle kakhulu kukho.
I'm not sure why.	Angiqiniseki kahle ukuthi kungani.
Later you will know why.	Kamuva uzokwazi ukuthi kungani.
I don't see how you can do it.	Angiboni ukuthi ungakwenza kanjani.
There is no wrong way to do this.	Ayikho indlela engalungile yokwenza lokhu.
He wanted children.	Wayefuna izingane.
Everyone does things their own way.	Wonke umuntu wenza ngendlela yakhe.
Same thing with this and this and this and this.	Into efanayo nalokhu nalokhu nalokhu nalokhu.
He would never want me to leave.	Wayengeke neze afune ngihambe.
He just tried harder.	Wavele wazama kakhulu.
I've been looking for one.	Bengilokhu ngifuna eyodwa.
I need to feel how you feel about me.	Ngidinga ukuzwa ukuthi uzizwa kanjani ngami.
No, not yet.	Cha, okwamanje.
What a great thing.	Yeka into enkulu.
All of that is easily seen.	Konke lokho kubonakala kalula.
At least a little.	Okungenani encane.
He is not in danger.	Akekho engozini.
I thought about that later.	Ngacabanga ngalokho kamuva.
His best friend.	Umngane wakhe omuhle kakhulu.
So, that’s my plan right now.	Ngakho, lelo icebo lami okwamanje.
John is a boy.	UJohn ungumfana.
How but still ?.	Kanjani kodwa namanje?.
Which should be a good thing.	Okufanele kube yinto enhle.
He said he would come.	Usho ukuthi uzofika.
Absolutely possible.	Kungenzeka ngokuphelele.
We all know that there are mistakes.	Sonke siyazi ukuthi kukhona amaphutha.
Yes, it is much better.	Yebo, kungcono kakhulu.
I wonder if sometimes again.	Ngiyazibuza ukuthi ngezinye izikhathi futhi.
Because it is me.	Ngoba yimina.
He will never be good to us.	Akasoze abe muhle kithi.
Really bad.	Omubi ngempela.
Let you,.	Ake wena,.
Okay, and don't forget about it.	Kulungile, futhi ungakhohlwa ngakho.
His mind works fast.	Umqondo wakhe usebenza ngokushesha.
He travels a lot.	Uhamba kakhulu.
Certainly not me.	Impela ngeke ngikwenze.
Someone who knows.	Umuntu owaziyo.
I would never ask anyone to do that.	Angisoze ngacela muntu ukuthi enze lokho.
And that he knows about us.	Nokuthi uyazi ngathi.
Good to know about you.	Kuhle ukwazi ngawe.
I will have to stay with him here if possible.	Kuzomele ngihlale naye lapha uma kwenzeka.
He is not even human.	Akayena ngisho umuntu.
Not very well, though.	Hhayi kahle kakhulu, noma kunjalo.
He was not here long.	Wayengekho isikhathi eside lapha.
Looks like it, though.	Kubukeka kunjalo, noma kunjalo.
My opinion has gone.	Umbono wami uye.
No, no problem.	Cha, ayikho inkinga.
And she is beautiful.	Futhi muhle .
Eventually he tried another method.	Ekugcineni wazama enye indlela.
Someone with your ability can make it easier.	Umuntu onekhono lakho angakwenza kube lula.
Nothing for us.	Akukho lutho kithi.
Probably.	Mhlawumbe .
This is not a good time for us.	Akusona isikhathi esihle kithi.
A little bit recently.	Kancane muva nje.
He didn't really think.	Wayengacabangi ngempela.
He wouldn't be here.	Ubengeke abe lapha.
Do not do this today.	Ungakwenzi lokhu namuhla.
Surprised that you want to work with him.	Emangele ukuthi ufuna ukusebenza naye.
So much for this time.	Kakhulu ngalesi sikhathi.
Nice to tell you.	Ngijabule ukukutshela.
Too bad, you can't.	Okubi kakhulu, awukwazi.
Why is that?.	Kungani kunjalo?.
Or so it is.	Noma cishe kunjalo.
Not so much, either.	Hhayi kakhulu, noma.
You probably expect.	Cishe ulindele.
So he knew.	Ngakho wayazi.
He never did anything.	Akakaze enze lutho.
But, you can't say.	Kodwa, awukwazi ukusho.
How to make money.	Indlela yokwenza imali.
It is not always a problem.	Akuyona inkinga njalo.
I need help .	Ngidinga usizo .
He tried to drink coffee.	Wazama ukuphuza ikhofi.
You do not have to be alone.	Akudingekile ukuba ube wedwa.
Not my father and not my family.	Hhayi ubaba wami hhayi umndeni wami.
This is the whole place.	Le ndawo yonke.
There is death.	Kukhona ukufa.
It's better for him there.	Kungcono kuye lapho.
Without him, we would not exist.	Ngaphandle kwakhe, ngabe asikho.
I can't go with you.	Angikwazi ukuhamba nami.
That was some three years ago.	Lokho kwenzeka cishe eminyakeni emithathu edlule.
Not at all temporary.	Akuyona neze isikhashana.
All choices.	Konke ukukhetha.
He was hoping he wouldn't say it.	Wayenethemba lokuthi angeke asho.
Everything else is your story.	Konke okunye indaba yakho.
There has to be somebody there.	Kufanele kube khona umuntu lapho.
I just need you to go.	Ngidinga nje ukuthi uhambe.
You will need to do more.	Uzodinga ukwenza okwengeziwe.
OK No problem.	Kulungile ayikho inkinga.
That should be fine.	Lokho kufanele kube kulungile.
Now almost.	Manje cishe.
Not just work.	Hhayi nje umsebenzi.
But my choice.	Kodwa ukukhetha kwami.
Or maybe with this.	Noma mhlawumbe nalokhu.
He felt good.	Wezwa kahle.
He did his best for years.	Wenza konke okusemandleni akhe iminyaka.
That was the beginning of his career.	Waqala lapho umsebenzi wakhe.
As you should have.	Njengoba kufanele ube nakho.
And now you have to go home.	Futhi manje kufanele uye ekhaya.
She is very beautiful too.	Muhle impela futhi.
She feels really good.	Uzizwa kahle impela.
This is probably okay.	Lokhu cishe kulungile.
And that he is.	Futhi ukuthi nguye.
It had to too.	Bekufanele futhi.
Here today, tomorrow go.	Lapha namuhla, kusasa uhambe.
It cannot be done all at once.	Ngeke kwenziwe konke ngesikhathi esisodwa.
You know that's not true.	Uyazi ukuthi akulona iqiniso.
But, again, it's your fault.	Kodwa, futhi, iphutha lakho.
No one is so good.	Akekho umuntu omuhle kanje.
Or it will be.	Noma kuzoba.
He just wants to know what everyone is doing.	Uthanda nje ukwazi ukuthi wonke umuntu wenzani.
He works here.	Usebenza lapha.
It would be easy to do this.	Kungaba lula ukwenza lokhu.
I wish you were here with me now.	Ngifisa sengathi ngabe ulapha nami manje.
I know a lot.	Ngiyazi okuningi.
He wouldn't do it.	Ubengeke akwenze.
That would be nice to have.	Lokho kungaba kuhle ukuba nakho.
But that's only once.	Kodwa lokho kanye kuphela.
Overeating.	Ukudla ngokweqile.
But that too is good enough.	Kodwa lokho futhi kuhle ngokwanele.
We have made a family.	Senze umndeni.
Yes, by that.	Yebo, ngalokho.
I will never speak to you again.	Ngeke ngiphinde ngikhulume nawe.
Great story there.	Indaba enkulu lapho.
That's right, that's just right.	Kunjalo nje, kunjalo nje.
I wonder who else is doing it.	Kazi ubani omunye owenza.
No, not at all.	Cha, hhayi kakhulu.
But let me tell you one thing.	Kodwa ake ngikutshele into eyodwa.
They say yes it is.	Bathi yebo kunjalo.
He too wanted to know things.	Naye wayefuna ukwazi izinto.
And, for now.	Futhi, okwamanje.
He did not do this.	Lokhu akakwenzanga.
He has never been able to live on the ground.	Akakaze akwazi ukuphila phansi.
I used to think.	Ngike ngicabange .
If you want.	Uma ufuna .
That's just the way it is for me.	Kunjalo nje kimi.
Taking knows how to take.	Ukuthatha uyazi ukuthatha.
He realized this.	Waqaphela lokhu.
I really should have.	Impela kufanele ngibe nakho.
No guns.	Asikho isibhamu.
He must leave immediately.	Kumele ahambe ngokushesha.
There’s a lot, a lot more, since last week.	Kukhona okuningi, okuningi kakhulu, kusukela ngesonto eledlule.
That's why he goes there.	Yingakho eya khona.
And so it is and so it is here.	Futhi kunjalo futhi kunjalo lapha.
But no one really knows what you should be like.	Kodwa akekho owaziyo ukuthi kufanele ube kanjani.
You will do everything right.	Uzokwenza konke kahle.
I will have to be alone.	Kuzodingeka ngibe ngedwa.
Some travel, too.	Okunye ukuhamba, futhi.
The police know better.	Amaphoyisa azi kangcono.
There is really no wrong answer.	Ayikho ngempela impendulo engalungile.
He was not in bed with her.	Wayengekho embhedeni naye.
Only problem.	Inkinga kuphela.
But he is afraid.	Kodwa wesaba.
My father went with me.	Ubaba wahamba nami.
He wants to do well in school.	Ufuna ukwenza kahle esikoleni.
You read everything, and you read everyone.	Ufunda yonke into, futhi ufunda wonke umuntu.
Not that he looks bad.	Hhayi ukuthi ubukeka kabi.
But that is not a bad thing.	Kodwa akukhona lokho okubi.
And she to him.	Futhi yena kuye.
No, not this one, he thought.	Cha, hhayi lena, wacabanga.
Vision.	Umbono .
There is that possibility.	Kukhona lokho kungenzeka.
He works with us.	Usebenza nathi.
At least not in this way.	Okungenani hhayi ngale ndlela.
You have made everyone a fool.	Wenze wonke umuntu isilima.
And apparently there is.	Futhi ngokusobala kukhona.
It will probably be so.	Cishe kuzoba njalo.
What happened to him.	Kwenzekani kuye.
I know this should be my key.	Ngiyazi ukuthi lokhu kufanele kube ukhiye wami.
Eventually, everyone will know.	Ekugcineni, wonke umuntu uzokwazi.
Because you want to work.	Ngoba ufuna ukusebenza.
I'm thinking of getting out.	Ngicabanga ukuphuma.
I have to find out.	Kufanele ngithole.
I'm really happy now.	Ngijabule ngempela manje.
You need money immediately.	Udinga imali ngokushesha.
Just saying that.	Ukukhuluma nje lokho.
He is not a bad person.	Akayena omubi.
And, it has.	Futhi, kube njalo.
I did not want to go back to work.	Ngangingafuni ukubuyela emsebenzini.
I do not know when or why.	Angazi ukuthi nini noma ngani.
Every day, you know.	Nsuku zonke, uyazi.
Even if you are.	Noma ukhona.
And now you know who he is.	Futhi manje uyazi ukuthi ubani.
My father said nothing.	Ubaba akazange asho lutho.
Hopefully once a week now.	Ngethemba kanye ngesonto manje.
But, there is no reason.	Kodwa, asikho isizathu.
And he will not say anything unless he has to.	Futhi ngeke asho lutho ngaphandle kokuthi kufanele.
And that's not me.	Futhi akumina lowo.
Just because it is obvious.	Ngoba nje kusobala.
But, that's another book.	Kodwa, leyo enye incwadi.
But he would not do that.	Kodwa wayengeke akwenze lokho.
I had to think about what to do.	Kwadingeka ngicabange ukuthi ngenzeni.
There is something else.	Kukhona enye into.
But this is okay.	Kodwa lokhu kulungile.
I need to hear more.	Ngidinga ukuzwa okunye.
This morning.	Ekuseni namuhla ekuseni.
You should not think that you are the best.	Akumele ucabange ukuthi ungcono.
This is not always true.	Lokhu akulona iqiniso ngaso sonke isikhathi.
Let me think about this for a few months.	Ake ngicabange ngalokhu izinyanga ezimbalwa.
Today, we do.	Namuhla, senza.
My house, my car, my job.	Indlu yami, imoto yami, umsebenzi wami.
I didn’t think it could be anything else.	Ngangingacabangi ukuthi kungaba enye into.
He doesn't know what else.	Akazi ukuthi yini enye.
Lots of water, actually.	Amanzi amaningi, empeleni.
Maybe it's just you.	Mhlawumbe nguwe kuphela.
You just can't do that.	Ngeke nje ukwenze lokho.
And he departed in the morning.	Futhi wahamba ekuseni.
But we all know that he will do it.	Kodwa sonke siyazi ukuthi uzokwenza.
I had to think of a message.	Kwadingeka ngicabange umlayezo.
You read a lot too.	Ufunda kakhulu futhi.
Dad looked at my age.	Ubaba wabheka iminyaka yami.
And he is really good at that.	Futhi muhle ngempela kulokho.
And a lot of you.	Futhi okuningi kwakho.
But this is not necessary.	Kodwa lokhu akudingekile.
I need to travel a lot.	Ngidinga ukuhamba kakhulu.
He always wants to get in.	Uhlala efuna ukungena.
I think it won't be that hard.	Ngicabanga ukuthi ngeke kube nzima kangako.
The door, me.	Umnyango, mina.
I'm not sure that could happen anyway.	Angiqiniseki ukuthi lokho kungenzeka noma kunjalo.
We need your permission, of course.	Sifuna imvume yakho, kunjalo.
But he knew nothing about it.	Kodwa wayengazi lutho ngalokhu.
This is a small thing.	Into encane le.
There is so much to do here, too.	Kuningi okufanele kwenziwe lapha, futhi.
He went as far as possible.	Wahamba kakhulu ngangokunokwenzeka.
I really hope you won't.	Empeleni ngethemba ukuthi ngeke.
He looked at the picture.	Wabuka isithombe.
He sat alone for a while.	Wahlala phansi yedwa isikhashana.
But who are you like?	Kodwa ufana nobani.
So with that, where you go.	Ngakho ngalokho, lapho uya khona.
My mother is here now.	Umama ukhona manje.
Someone is trying to move on.	Omunye uzama ukuqhubeka.
But Dad probably doesn't know anything about it.	Kodwa ubaba kungenzeka ukuthi akazi lutho ngakho.
He did not even look surprised.	Akazange ngisho abonakale emangele.
Always he, actually.	Njalo yena, empeleni.
But if you want to, that's fine.	Kodwa uma ufuna, kulungile.
Good thing for you.	Into enhle ngawe.
And he may be helpful.	Futhi angase abe usizo.
My mother left.	Umama wahamba.
There is a door.	Kukhona umnyango.
That's all it takes to be in there.	Yilokho kuphela okudingeka kube phakathi lapho.
He didn't really know what to do with her.	Wayengazi ngempela ukuthi enzeni ngaye.
He did not stay in the house.	Akazange ahlale endlini.
I will be near you.	Ngizoba eduze kwakho.
It should be a big deal.	Kufanele kube yinto enkulu.
How good is that?!.	Kuhle kanjani lokho?!.
This is a good time, too.	Lesi sikhathi esihle, futhi.

I love my meat so much.	Ngithanda inyama yami kakhulu.
And, what happened.	Futhi, kwenzekani.
He refused and tried to drive.	Wenqaba wazama ukushayela.
You need to think.	Udinga ukucabanga.
Just life, not death.	Ukuphila nje, hhayi ukufa.

You need to work.	Udinga ukusebenza.
There really must be something else.	Impela kufanele kube khona okunye.
You know who he is.	Uyazi ukuthi ubani.
This is not a one-time event.	Akusona isikhathi esisodwa nje lesi.
Good news when you think about it.	Indaba enhle uma ucabanga ngayo.
Still no fix.	Noma kunjalo akukho ukulungisa.
Instead, you learn why.	Kunalokho, ufunda ngokuthi kungani.
I think he is good to have.	Ngicabanga ukuthi muhle ukuba naye.
There doesn't have to be one.	Akudingeki kube khona eyodwa.
Soon he began to speak.	Ngokushesha waqala ukukhuluma.
When you eat better, you feel better.	Uma udla kangcono, uzizwa ungcono.
It could be earlier.	Kungaba ngaphambili.
Nice place in town.	Indawo enhle edolobheni.
But that is not the problem here.	Kodwa lokho akuyona inkinga lapha.
He has to learn from it.	Kufanele afunde kukho.
You can't, but you can.	Ngeke, kodwa ungakwenza.
Not really.	Cha ngempela.
He has to come back.	Kufanele abuye.
To get to the top.	Ukuze uthole phezulu.
I mean, maybe so.	Ngisho, mhlawumbe kunjalo.
But that is not all he did.	Kodwa akukhona lokho kuphela akwenza.
I was not thinking about that.	Bengingacabangi ngalokho.
This will not be easy.	Lokhu ngeke kwenziwe kalula.
But he remains.	Kodwa yena uhlala.
I just want to know.	Ngithanda ukwazi nje.
You seem to be wrong about that.	Ubonakala unephutha ngalokho.
Now, you're wrong.	Manje, unephutha.
One gun.	Isibhamu esisodwa.
It does not mean that he knows everything.	Akusho ukuthi wazi konke.

It can be in place.	Kungaba endaweni.
Or hear me.	Noma ngizwe.

It should not really be so at all.	Akufanele ngempela kube kuningi nhlobo kukho.
He may be here with her.	Angase abe lapha naye.
The biggest mistake.	Iphutha elikhulu kakhulu.
Her family said no thank you.	Umndeni wakhe wathi cha ngiyabonga.
It would have been better.	Ngabe kungcono.
But for now, there is really nothing on the table.	Kodwa okwamanje, akukho lutho ngempela etafuleni.
And he is anxious to make sure that it is true.	Futhi ukhathazekile ukwenza isiqiniseko sokuthi kuyiqiniso.
He did not really have to think about this.	Kwakungadingeki ngempela acabange ngalokhu.
He just felt that way.	Wavele wezwa kanjalo .
He said it was wrong.	Wathi kwakungafanele.
I did not want to go back there.	Ngangingafuni ukubuyela lapho.

But no, that's true.	Kodwa cha, kuyiqiniso.
The man began to sing.	Umuntu waqala ukucula.
He can but anyone.	Angakwazi kodwa noma ubani.
It could be a mistake.	Kungase kube iphutha.
I do not love you because of you, but because of me.	Angikuthandi ngenxa yakho, kodwa ngenxa yami.
I wanted to help people.	Ngangifuna ukusiza abantu.
This is not the case.	Akukhona lokhu okwenzekayo.
I did not want him to leave.	Ngangingafuni ukuthi ahambe.
Not the eyes.	Hhayi amehlo.
I just wish it was that easy.	Ngifisa nje kube lula kanjalo.
No reason, I just wanted to.	Asikho isizathu, bengifuna nje.
Many years on earth.	Iminyaka eminingi emhlabeni.
Yes, that's right.	Yebo, lokhu kulungile.
I'm scared to be alone.	Ngesaba ukuba ngedwa.

I hope it will happen now.	Ngethemba ukuthi kuzokwenzeka manje.
He looked hard.	Wabheka kanzima.
This may be the case, but this is not our fault.	Lokhu kungase kube njalo, kodwa lokhu akulona icala lethu.
Yes, that's actually right.	Yebo, lokho empeleni kulungile.
I felt that way.	Ngezwa kunjalo.
And he did evil.	Futhi wenza okubi.
He is a young man.	Uyindoda encane.
Sometimes nothing.	Ngezinye izikhathi akukho lutho.
But he did not know that.	Kodwa lokho wayengazi.
I thought that was you.	Bengicabanga ukuthi nguwe lowo.
Time cannot be there.	Isikhathi asikwazi ukuba khona lapho.
Another negative.	Okunye okubi.
I don't know more.	Angazi okwengeziwe.
Anyway well.	Noma kanjani kahle.
That's not my opinion, it's the truth.	Akuwona umbono wami lowo, kuyiqiniso.
You wouldn’t say that last year.	Ubungeke usho lokho ngonyaka odlule.
Good on that.	Kuhle ngalokho.
Want to learn more.	Ufuna ukufunda okwengeziwe.
And you should be.	Futhi kufanele ube .

Death happens here.	Ukufa kwenzeka lapha.
He said he would never.	Wathi akasoze.
You should know, but you can't.	Kufanele ukwazi, kodwa awukwazi.
But to be honest, it's not your thing.	Kodwa uma ngikhuluma iqiniso, akuyona into yakho.
A nice little thing.	Into encane enhle.
Yeah, yeah, that's me.	Yebo, yebo, yimina lokho.

But you have to do it right.	Kodwa kufanele ukwenze kahle.
True or not I do not know.	Iqiniso noma cha angazi.
And that's why all this.	Futhi yingakho konke lokhu.
And not that close.	Futhi hhayi ukuthi eduze.
You just need to try to help someone every day.	Udinga nje ukuzama ukusiza othile nsuku zonke.
Not in one place, but everywhere.	Akukho endaweni eyodwa, kodwa yonke indawo.
I feel very self-conscious.	Ngizizwa mina kakhulu.
I think so, though.	Ngicabanga kanjalo, noma kunjalo.
You think it would be good.	Ucabanga ukuthi kungaba kuhle.
Not once but many times.	Hhayi kanye kodwa izikhathi eziningi.
Sooner or later, one has to leave.	Ngokushesha noma kamuva, umuntu kufanele ahambe.
All right, tell me.	Kulungile, ngitshele.
Too much indeed.	Kuningi kakhulu ngempela.
I probably should have known that.	Cishe kwakufanele ngikwazi lokho.
And he never has time.	Futhi akakaze abe khona isikhathi.
As we do every morning.	Njengoba senza njalo ekuseni.
My mother was not at home.	Umama wayengekho ekhaya.
I am afraid to speak.	Ngesaba ukukhuluma.
Before we left.	Ngaphambi kokuthi sihambe.
Or he was hopeful.	Noma wayenethemba.
One more.	Okunye futhi .
He took his own life immediately.	Wathatha ukuphila kwakhe ngokushesha.
People say that it is really hard today.	Abantu bathi kunzima ngempela namuhla.
Sometimes it happens in the right place.	Ngezinye izikhathi kwenzeka endaweni efanele.
I wanted a baby.	Ngangifuna ingane.
But also get the answer.	Kodwa futhi uthole impendulo.
As you know, we did not.	Njengoba wazi, asizange.
No thanks to him.	Cha ngiyabonga kuye.
Why again.	Kungani futhi.
I would never think of such a thing.	Angisoze ngacabanga into enjalo.
Something more was needed.	Kwakudingeka okuthile okwengeziwe.
I have to do this again, soon.	Kufanele ngikwenze lokhu futhi, maduze nje.
I've been thinking about it until now.	Bengilokhu ngicabanga ngakho kuze kube lapha.

I really want to stay with you.	Ngifuna ngempela ukuhlala nawe.
He is like you and you act like me.	Ufana nawe futhi wenza njengami.
But that is not my decision.	Kodwa akusona isinqumo sami leso.

That's the entry.	Yilokho ukungena.
You are trying to do too much.	Uzama ukwenza okuningi kakhulu.
If someone wants to do something on their own, that's fine.	Uma umuntu efuna ukwenza okuthile eyedwa, kulungile.
Here is the water problem.	Lapha inkinga amanzi.
I don't think you need to say anything else.	Angicabangi ukuthi udinga ukusho okunye.
Maybe you can't see it.	Mhlawumbe awukwazi ukukubona.
I just want you to be happy.	Ngifuna ujabule nje.
Great, of course.	Okukhulu, kunjalo.
He stayed that way for a while.	Wahlala kanjalo isikhashana.
You should have done it before.	Bekufanele ngabe ukwenzile ngaphambili.
It is not a mistake to choose.	Akulona iphutha ukukhetha.

To get home.	Ukuze ngifike ekhaya.
I wanted to stay out.	Ngangifuna ukuhlala ngaphandle.
And be with me.	Futhi ube nami.
But money, no.	Kodwa imali, cha.
I thought of the cat for a moment.	Ngacabanga ikati isikhashana.
I'm sure it will be fine.	Ngiqinisekile kuzoba kuhle.
He may leave tomorrow.	Angase ahambe kusasa.
He can't help people.	Angeke akwazi ukusiza abantu.
All you have to do is.	Konke okumele ukwenze .
I knew anyway.	Ngangazi noma kunjalo.
Maybe very early in the morning it would be better.	Mhlawumbe ekuseni kakhulu kungaba ngcono.
However, the work began.	Noma kunjalo, umsebenzi waqala.
But not this one.	Kodwa hhayi lokhu okunye.
We have done so here.	Senze njalo lapha.
I can't find another case.	Angikwazi ukuthola elinye icala.
I feel like walking.	Ngizwa ukuhamba.
You, not so much.	Wena, hhayi kakhulu.
It doesn't have to be this way.	Akufanele kube kanje.
He is a man, but he is only one man.	Uyindoda, kodwa uyindoda eyodwa kuphela.
I suspect this is a really good book.	Ngisola ukuthi incwadi enhle ngempela lena.
Anyone can ride a bike, he thought.	Noma ubani angakwazi ukugibela ibhayisikili, wacabanga.
That was supposed to be him.	Lowo kwakufanele kube nguye.

She too is amazed.	Naye wamangala.
And singing is hard.	Futhi ukucula kunzima.
He should have been better than that.	Kwakufanele abe ngcono kunalokho.
Because you would not expect everything.	Ngoba ubungeke ulindele yonke into.
Yes he really is.	Yebo ukhona ngempela.
And all of that happened recently.	Futhi konke lokho kwenzeke muva nje.
I think you know better now.	Ngicabanga ukuthi wazi kangcono manje.
Your time now.	Isikhathi sakho manje.
Now I have to go.	Manje kufanele ngihambe.
At least for all, me.	Okungenani kukho konke, mina.
Now the big question.	Manje umbuzo omkhulu.
But anyway.	Kodwa noma kanjani.
But sometimes he did not.	Kodwa ngezinye izikhathi akazange.
Not just a week or a few months.	Hhayi nje isonto noma izinyanga ezimbalwa.
This is not one thing.	Lokhu akuyona into eyodwa.
He always talked about her.	Wakhuluma njalo ngaye.
His mind is very busy.	Umqondo wakhe umatasa kakhulu.
But not when you talk.	Kodwa hhayi uma ukhuluma.
I would not have much time.	bengingeke ngibe nesikhathi esiningi.
And not just one at a time.	Futhi hhayi nje eyodwa ngesikhathi.
Also, she was not a mother.	Futhi, wayengeyena umama.
Apparently he did.	Ngokusobala wenze.
And this is nothing new.	Futhi lokhu akuyona into entsha.
When you all that out.	Lapho wena konke lokho ngaphandle.
But he was very scared.	Kodwa wayesaba kakhulu.
It is very difficult to do.	Kunzima kakhulu ukwenza.
I think of us both.	Ngicabanga ngathi sobabili.
I better know.	Kungcono ngikwazi.
I mean, you should.	Ngisho, kufanele.
The one who makes the gift.	Lowo owenza isipho.
I did my homework.	Ngenze umsebenzi wesikole.
You know? 	Uyazi?
You did not do that with me.	Awuzange ukwenze lokho nami.
She thinks she is very beautiful.	Ucabanga ukuthi muhle kakhulu.
Thank you for doing so well !.	Ngiyabonga ngokwenza kahle kangaka!.
That's why you feel bad.	Yingakho uzizwa kabi.
And these are all at once.	Futhi lezi zonke ngesikhathi esisodwa.
He thought hard.	Wacabanga kakhulu.
Way, way, way too.	Indlela, indlela, indlela kakhulu.
No, that is not true at all.	Cha, lokho akulona iqiniso ngempela.
He told me about it.	Wangitshela ngalokho.
Good on this.	Kuhle kulokhu.
I wanted to say she is beautiful.	Bengifuna ukusho ukuthi muhle.
He wondered how this could happen.	Wazibuza ukuthi kungenzeka kanjani lokhu.
His home is here.	Umuzi wakhe ulapha.
Even your family.	Ngisho nomndeni wakho.
He also knows nothing.	Naye akazi lutho.
Very good.	Omuhle impela.
That you will know.	Ukuthi uzokwazi.
But, he wondered the same thing.	Kodwa, wazibuza into efanayo.
And this is not the same thing.	Futhi lokhu akuyona into efanayo.
Not much is happening at all.	Akukho okuningi okwenzekayo nhlobo.
And we do sometimes.	Futhi senza ngezinye izikhathi.
And me .	Futhi mina .
He could not return home.	Akakwazanga ukubuyela ekhaya.
It could happen right now.	Kungenzeka khona manje.
What was I supposed to do? 	Kwakufanele ngenzeni?
Won't you?	Ngeke?
He always goes, really.	Uhamba njalo, empeleni.
But, yes, maybe.	Kodwa, yebo, mhlawumbe.
My mother did not look surprised.	Umama akazange abonakale emangele.
He appeared in our place.	Wabonakala endaweni yethu.
And again nothing.	Futhi futhi lutho.
That he can be beautiful.	Ukuthi angaba muhle.
And, of course, we all want that to happen.	Futhi, kunjalo, sonke sifuna ukuthi lokho kwenzeke.
Not a pain at all.	Hhayi ubuhlungu nakancane.
I know the best way.	Ngiyazi indlela engcono.
Or some food.	Noma okunye ukudla.
Because you want a job.	Ngoba ufuna umsebenzi.
First? 	Okokuqala?
It will definitely be better.	Impela kuzoba ngcono.
I could not stop that.	Angikwazanga ukuyeka lokho.
And he, too, at that time.	Futhi naye, ngaleso sikhathi.
Let me tell you how you can do that.	Ake ngikutshele ukuthi ungakwenza kanjani lokho.
This, that, the other.	Lokhu, lokho, okunye.
In fact, this can be very difficult.	Empeleni, lokhu kungase kube nzima kakhulu.
Almost just an accident.	Cishe ingozi nje.
He couldn't even get into her.	Akakwazanga ngisho ukungena kuye.
He had to do his job.	Kwakufanele enze umsebenzi wakhe.
We do it that way.	Senza indlela enjalo.
Not at first, though.	Hhayi ekuqaleni, noma kunjalo.
Another good one too.	Enye enhle futhi.
Probably just an idea.	Mhlawumbe umbono kuphela.
You have to find a way on your own.	Kufanele uthole indlela uwedwa.
Now we need another way.	Manje sidinga enye indlela.
Please let us go home.	Ngicela sihambe siye ekhaya.
But in this case, he did just that.	Kodwa kulokhu, yilokho kanye akwenza.
I think everyone is here.	Ngicabanga ukuthi wonke umuntu ulapha.
As soon as that.	Ngokushesha kanjalo.
I want you to be a father.	Ngifuna ube ubaba.
Good ?.	Kuhle?.
The question is where.	Umbuzo uthi kuphi.
Everyone wants it all.	Wonke umuntu ufuna konke.
He decided his death.	Wanquma ukufa kwakhe.
I would like to talk to him.	Ngingathanda ukukhuluma naye.
The work took several months.	Lo msebenzi wathatha izinyanga ezimbalwa.
Yes, right now.	Yebo, njengamanje.
But now, who knows.	Kodwa manje, ubani owaziyo.
He wasn't human, of course.	Wayengeyena umuntu, kunjalo.
So much is not my thing.	Kakhulu nje akuyona into yami.
He's here in the house now.	Ukhona lapha endlini manje.
Just to say that it is possible.	Ukusho nje ukuthi kungenzeka.
Anyone else can, too, easily.	Noma ubani omunye angakwazi futhi, kalula nje.
I had to think, too.	Kwadingeka ngicabange, futhi.
There is something else he wants to do.	Kukhona okunye afuna akwenze.
At least once.	Okungenani ngesikhathi esisodwa.
I want to tell my friends about it.	Ngifuna ukutshela abangani bami ngakho.
But it may be true.	Kodwa kungenzeka kuyiqiniso.
There is certainly a lot going on here.	Impela kuningi okwenzekayo lapha.
I know you well enough.	Ngikwazi kahle ngokwanele.
He did not seek his own opinion.	Akazange afune umbono wakhe.
Yes, he did this to her.	Yebo, wakwenza lokhu kuye.
Apparently he was not.	Ngokusobala wayengeyena.
No, he did not.	Cha, akakwenzanga lokho.
You need air.	Udinga umoya.
He told me that he thinks you feel the same way.	Wangitshela ukuthi ucabanga ukuthi nawe uzizwa ngendlela efanayo.
There is nothing wrong with that, really.	Akukho okubi kulokho, ngempela.
I think about it every day.	Ngicabanga ngakho nsuku zonke.
I didn’t think so, of course.	Bengingacabangi, kunjalo.
The only problem is time.	Inkinga isikhathi kuphela.
I can no longer wait to leave.	Angisakwazi ukulinda ukuhamba.
I think of his family.	Ngicabanga umndeni wakhe.
He got a lot out of his time.	Uthole okuningi ngesikhathi sakhe.
Not almost no, not almost none.	Hhayi cishe akukho, hhayi cishe akukho.
It could be you or me.	Kungenzeka kuwe noma kimi.
You know very well that it is not.	Uyazi kahle ukuthi akunjalo.

Why we do things.	Kungani senza izinto.
But you can't try.	Kodwa awukwazi ukuzama.
Only.	Kuphela kuphela.

But that is not a problem.	Kodwa leyo akuyona inkinga.
I just don't have it.	Anginayo nje.
It really should and really should.	Akufanele ngempela futhi ngempela.
I don’t want to think about this.	Angifuni ukucabanga ngalokhu.
Arriving will be difficult.	Ukufika kuzoba nzima.
Yes, but no.	Yebo, kodwa cha.
He could not do anything today.	Akakwazanga ukwenza lutho namuhla.
Next he looked bad.	Eduze wayebukeka kabi.
She is fine so far.	Uhlala kahle kuze kube manje.
You have to stay in the middle.	Kufanele uhlale phakathi.
He shouldn’t try, so he doesn’t.	Akumele azame, ngakho akunjalo.
You are not either.	Awuyena futhi.
I always know exactly when and how.	Ngihlale ngazi kahle ukuthi nini futhi.
I do not have a gun.	Anginaso isibhamu.
He is trying to make you think you are everywhere.	Uzama ukwenza ucabange ukuthi ukhona yonke indawo.
Absolutely very.	Impela kakhulu.
Sounds like a past life.	Kuzwakala sengathi impilo edlule.
He wanted something bad.	Wayefuna into embi.

And you know that to be true.	Futhi uyazi ukuthi kuyiqiniso.
You can't stay there.	Awukwazi ukuhlala kukho.
I think yes, maybe.	Ngicabanga ukuthi yebo, mhlawumbe.
Of course that did not happen.	Yebo akuzange kwenzeke lokho.
But you do not know everything.	Kodwa awukwazi konke.
But you do not know what you are doing.	Kodwa awazi ukuthi uhamba ngani.
Maybe not but the idea.	Mhlawumbe akunjalo kodwa umqondo.
Or if you can't wait.	Noma uma ungakwazi ukulinda.
She's worried, but a little bit.	Ukhathazekile, kodwa kancane.
But it did not happen to me.	Kodwa akuzange kimi.
I wanted to say something about him later.	Bengifuna ukusho okuthile ngaye kamuva.
I should have gotten a week at least.	Bekufanele ngithole isonto okungenani.
A friend did that recently.	Umngane wenze lokho muva nje.
But, again, this is life.	Kodwa, futhi, lokhu ukuphila.
You are waiting for my response.	Ulindele impendulo yami.
This person has done a terrible job.	Lo muntu wenze umsebenzi omubi kangaka.
Yes, it should.	Yebo, bekufanele kube njalo.
He knows nothing at all.	Akazi lutho nhlobo.
I don't think you feel that way.	Angicabangi ukuthi uzizwa kanjalo.
We can't do it without you.	Ngeke sikwenze ngaphandle kwakho.
We make money from it.	Senza imali ngayo.
I think we should do this.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kufanele sikwenze lokhu.
You must not do this.	Akumele wenze lokhu.
But, maybe not always.	Kodwa, mhlawumbe hhayi njalo.
That will happen next week.	Lokho kuzokwenzeka ngesonto elizayo.
But you have to be.	Kodwa kufanele ube njalo.
Not only for you but for him, too.	Hhayi ngawe kuphela kodwa naye, futhi.

And this, and that, and this.	Futhi lokhu, nalokho, nalokhu.
Because you will be alone.	Ngoba uzoba wedwa.
There is this, and there is this.	Kukhona lokhu, futhi kukhona lokhu.
I don't know if you are asleep or not.	Angazi noma ulele noma cha.
I'm not sure how it happened.	Angiqiniseki ukuthi kwenzeke kanjani.
Please do your job.	Ngicela wenze umsebenzi wakho.
It will not be, this soon.	Ngeke kube khona, lokhu maduze.
I will not stay with you here.	Angeke ngihlale nawe lapha.
He sat next to me in prison.	Wahlala eduze kwami ​​ejele.
I didn't want to do it all again.	Ngangingafuni ukukwenza konke futhi.
He wouldn't come.	Ubengeke eze.
He did this three times.	Wakwenza lokho izikhathi ezintathu.
And maybe that's the key here.	Futhi mhlawumbe lokho ukhiye lapha.
But eventually it will happen.	Kodwa ekugcineni kuzokwenzeka.
It is not a new book.	Akuyona incwadi entsha.
Very, very quickly.	Ngokushesha, ngokushesha okukhulu.
But there is no other way.	Kodwa ayikho enye indlela.
You should have this.	Kufanele ube nalokhu.
I have never told you the whole truth.	Angikaze ngikutshele lonke iqiniso.
Since he is not there, you should go there.	Njengoba engekho, kufanele uye khona.
Let me think about it for a few days.	Ake ngicabange ngakho izinsuku ezimbalwa.
Good job there.	Muhle umsebenzi lapho.
I am the only one in the house.	Yimi ngedwa endlini.
Work to make you happy.	Umsebenzi ukwenza ujabule.
Do not be alone.	Ungabi lapha wedwa.
No one wants to know.	Akekho ofuna ukwazi.
I always feel.	Ngizwa njalo.
Everyone and everything.	Wonke umuntu nakho konke.
But in this case, it is true.	Kodwa kulokhu, kuyiqiniso.
You can do that well.	Ungakwenza kahle lokho.
Of course, that did not happen.	Yebo, akuzange kwenzeke lokho.
We make a mistake in the same way.	Senza iphutha ngendlela efanayo.
We all want him back.	Sonke sifuna abuye.
I know he doesn't.	Ngiyazi ukuthi akanalo.
You need more things to go.	Udinga ezinye izinto ukuze uhambe kahle.
Death is not a job.	Ukufa akuwona umsebenzi.
You know, too.	Uyazi, futhi.
Doing this can be difficult.	Ukwenza lokhu kungaba nzima.
I can't make a decision now.	Angikwazi ukuthatha isinqumo manje.
I know better, you know.	Ngazi kangcono, uyazi.
That is why we have done so badly.	Yingakho senze kabi kangaka.
And he realized he didn't have a car there.	Futhi wabona ukuthi akanayo imoto lapho.
I wonder here.	Ngiyazibuza lapha.
He seems to be alone in the world.	Ubonakala eyedwa emhlabeni.
But this cannot be done properly.	Kodwa lokhu angeke kwenziwe kahle.
Not now, maybe not always.	Hhayi manje, mhlawumbe hhayi njalo.
I will never talk about it again.	Ngeke ngiphinde ngikhulume ngayo.
I'd like to check out.	Ngingathanda ukuphuma.
This is true today.	Lokhu kuyiqiniso namuhla.
Even coffee is.	Ngisho ikhofi kunjalo.
No, something he really likes.	Cha, into angathanda ngempela.
That is probably not necessary here.	Lokho cishe akudingekile lapha.
And now you have to.	Futhi manje kufanele nawe.
There is not much you need to have.	Akukho okuningi okufanele ube nakho.
Tell me what happened.	Ungitshele ukuthi kwenzekeni.
The door will not lock.	Umnyango ngeke ukhiye.
I just need a gun.	Ngidinga nje isibhamu.
Everyone knows it.	Wonke umuntu uyakwazi.
It may be difficult at first.	Kungase kube nzima ekuqaleni.
There must have been a mistake.	Impela kube khona iphutha.
We both know it won't happen.	Sobabili siyazi ukuthi ngeke kwenzeke.
Probably not.	Cishe bekungafanele.
It may be wrong.	Kungase kube yinto engalungile.
But that's all.	Kodwa yilokho konke.
He just wanted to go.	Wayefuna nje ukuhamba.
I would like to do more.	Ngingathanda ukwenza okwengeziwe.
If so, you did well.	Uma kunjalo, wenze kahle.
The only problem is the presence.	Inkinga nje, ukuba khona.
Well done to you.	Wenze kahle wena.
I will not be.	ngeke ngibe.
Not only that, too.	Hhayi lokho kuphela, futhi.
Three years long.	Iminyaka emithathu isikhathi eside.
We do a lot.	Senza okuningi.
I have never done such a thing before.	Angikaze ngenze into enjalo ngaphambili.
This is indeed very difficult to do at first.	Ngempela lokhu kunzima kakhulu ukukwenza ekuqaleni.
I need a few things for you.	Ngidinga izinto ezimbalwa kuwe.
We must all go.	Kufanele sihambe sonke.
I know how to do it.	Ngiyazi ukwenza.
And me too.	Futhi nami.
Indeed, he is clearly saying that.	Ngempela, usho lokho ngokusobala.
There is much he cannot say.	Kuningi angeke akusho.
And first he is determined.	Futhi okokuqala uzimisele.
You know there is.	Uyazi kukhona.
You should know in advance.	Kufanele wazi kusenesikhathi.
I can no longer cry.	Angisakwazi ukukhala.
The doctor says it's okay to talk to you.	Udokotela uthi kulungile ukukhuluma nawe.
He said it meant nothing.	Uthe akusho lutho.
Or it could be good.	Noma kungaba kuhle.
At his age.	Ngeminyaka yakhe .
And in the right place.	Futhi endaweni efanele.
You need help, or maybe permission.	Ufuna usizo, noma mhlawumbe imvume.
Do you think positively or not.	Ingabe ukucabanga kahle noma cha.
I have to think about this.	Kufanele ngicabange ngalokhu.
I'm just waiting there.	Ngilinde nje lapho.
It may be now.	Kungase kube manje.
But again, whatever.	Kodwa futhi, noma yini.
Or at the beginning.	Noma ekuqaleni.
So he seems to be coming first.	Ngakho kubonakala efika kuqala.
This is more difficult than it seems.	Lokhu kunzima kunalokho kubonakala.
You should not have done it.	Bekungafanele ukwenze.
This is not a day.	Akulona usuku.
He did not know that it would happen.	Wayengazi ukuthi kuzokwenzeka.
And be kind to us.	Futhi ube muhle kithi.
Or he never wanted to.	Noma akakaze afune.
Front or back.	Ngaphambili noma ngemuva.
But you can't read much about it.	Kodwa awukwazi ukufunda okuningi ngakho.
The whole family lives here.	Umndeni wonke uhlala lapha.
I thought about him all the time.	Ngangicabanga ngaye ngaso sonke isikhathi.
Everyone will definitely come.	Wonke umuntu uzofika nakanjani.
Tell me things.	Ngitshele izinto.
Anything but him.	Noma yini ngaphandle kwakhe.
I did that recently.	Ngikwenze lokho muva nje.
The worst would be to get there.	Okubi kakhulu kuzoba ukufika lapho.
I thought maybe you're down here with you.	Bengithi mhlawumbe ulapha phansi nawe.
But at night something happens.	Kodwa ebusuku kukhona okwenzekayo.
And now you, that's right.	Futhi manje wena, kunjalo.
When that happens.	Uma lokho kwenzeka.
But if you can't talk about it, you can't.	Kodwa uma ungakwazi ukukhuluma ngakho, awukwazi.
But there is more, you know.	Kodwa kukhona okwengeziwe, uyazi.
No, not pretty.	Cha, hhayi muhle.
You don't have to tell me that story.	Asikho isidingo sokuthi ungitshele leyo ndaba.
I did not want to cry.	Ngangingafuni ukukhala.
And that's all.	Futhi yilokho kuphela.
I do not know and I will not.	Angazi futhi ngeke.
This is probably not necessary.	Lokhu mhlawumbe akudingekile.
I think it will be a lot for me.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kuzoba kuningi kimi.
Everyone sat down to eat.	Wonke umuntu wahlala phansi ukuze adle.
I thought it would not.	Bengicabanga ukuthi ngeke.
Really great thing.	Into enkulu ngempela .
Up, for now.	Phezulu, okwamanje.
But he felt pain.	Kodwa wezwa ubuhlungu.
Because everyone is moving slowly.	Ngoba wonke umuntu uhamba kancane.
I want to go home alone.	Ngifuna ukuya ngedwa ekhaya.
It seems like no one is looking for a job lately.	Kubonakala sengathi akekho ofuna umsebenzi muva nje.
To this day, no one else.	Kuze kube namuhla, akekho omunye.
Everything that happened last year.	Konke okwenzeka ngonyaka odlule .
Only to find another door.	Kuphela ukuthola omunye umnyango.
He nodded slightly.	Wavuma kancane.
But you should not do this.	Kodwa akufanele ukwenze lokhu.
It's okay to be here with me.	Kulungile ukuba lapha nami.
People are the problem.	Abantu inkinga.
That's money.	Imali leyo.
We need more time to find out what's going on.	Sidinga isikhathi esengeziwe ukuze sithole ukuthi kwenzakalani.
The boy is a good player.	Umfana ungumdlali omuhle.
My mother wanted me to be a boy.	Umama wayefuna ngibe umfana.
Really, we really need to know who did this.	Ngempela, sidinga ngempela ukwazi ukuthi ubani owenze lokhu.
My mother was not in the car now.	Umama wayengekho emotweni manje.
He did his job.	Wenza umsebenzi wakhe.
So do it.	Ngakho wenze.
It will definitely be helpful.	Impela kuzoba usizo.
I’ve done that a lot.	Ngikwenze lokho kakhulu.
He went to his house.	Waya endlini yakhe.
He stayed home all this time.	Wahlala ekhaya sonke lesi sikhathi.
It just so happens that you stay with me.	Kwenzeka nje ukuthi uhlale nami.
He would not be here long.	Wayengeke abe lapha isikhathi eside.
I want you to leave immediately.	Ngifuna uhambe ngokushesha.
Any of us can be.	Noma ubani kithi angaba.
He left yesterday morning.	Uhambe izolo ekuseni .
That's all today.	Yilokho kuphela namuhla.
He certainly should have known better.	Impela bekumele azi kangcono.
His spirit died.	Umoya wakhe washona.
You want to try.	Ufuna ukuzama.
Now this.	Manje lokhu.
Not just in our house but everywhere.	Hhayi nje endlini yethu kodwa yonke indawo.
Not just about you, but your whole family.	Hhayi nje ngawe, kodwa wonke umndeni wakho.
I talked to him myself.	Ngikhulume naye mina.
You can do that easily.	Ungakwenza lokho kalula.
I should not think so.	Akufanele ngicabange kanjalo.
It's a little true.	Kuyiqiniso kancane.
First at home.	Okokuqala ekhaya.
I didn’t realize that anyone wouldn’t be.	Angizange ngibone ukuthi noma ubani wayengeke abe.
It can be one or more.	Kungaba eyodwa noma eziningi.
Don't forget that.	Ungakhohlwa lokho.
You must not go either.	Akumele nawe uhambe.
We found it earlier.	Sithole ngaphambilini.
He was not sure what he wanted to do now.	Wayengenaso isiqiniseko sokuthi ufuna ukwenzani manje.
Tests should be done soon.	Ukuhlolwa kufanele kwenziwe maduze.
No, it is not.	Cha, akunjalo impela.
Too often someone has become me.	Kaningi kakhulu ukuthi umuntu ube yimi.
So, yes, a gun.	Ngakho, yebo, isibhamu.
He was surprised alone.	Wamangala yedwa.
I don't know if that's right.	Angazi ukuthi kunjalo.
There is no new location.	Ayikho indawo entsha.
You know all this.	Konke lokhu uyakwazi.
I can't tell you what you did.	Angikwazi ukukutshela ukuthi wenzeni.
I'm trying to buy your life.	Ngizama ukuthenga impilo yakho.
You know you need it.	Uyazi ukuthi udinga.

I will, if you will.	Ngizokwenza, uma uthanda.
Not my family, but me.	Hhayi umndeni wami, kodwa mina.
He knew nothing at all.	Wayengazi lutho nhlobo.
But he will not do it.	Kodwa ngeke akwenze.
I will leave at that time.	Ngizohamba ngaleso sikhathi.
This is not what is happening here.	Akukhona lokhu okwenzeka lapha.
He returned to prison.	Wabuyela ejele.
He thought yesterday.	Ucabange izolo.
That's what the doctor said, though.	Yilokho udokotela akusho, noma kunjalo.
Not all at once, of course.	Akunjalo konke ngesikhathi esisodwa, kunjalo.
We know, we know, we know.	Siyazi, siyazi, siyazi.
I live here every day.	Ngihlala lapha nsuku zonke.
Or at least the name.	Noma okungenani igama.
But all the way there is nothing.	Kodwa yonke indlela akukho lutho.
You do not need to eat there.	Awudingi ukudla lapho.
You need that there.	Udinga lokho lapho.
There is so much to do.	Kuningi okumele kwenziwe .
And he is the best person in the world.	Futhi ungumuntu omuhle kakhulu emhlabeni.
He tried one.	Wazama eyodwa.
It would be better for you.	Kungaba ngcono kuwe.
We have done everything for ourselves.	Senze konke kithi.
He became my friend.	Waba umngane wami.
So, that's just right.	Ngakho, kunjalo nje.
First you need a large area.	Okokuqala udinga indawo enkulu.
She's worried about him too.	Ukhathazekile ngaye futhi.
No, it's very good.	Cha, kuhle kakhulu.
I must not do it! 	Akumele ngikwenze!
Now, in trouble.	Manje, enkingeni.
At first he did very well.	Ekuqaleni wenza kahle impela.

You do not want this to happen again.	Awufuni ukuthi lokhu kwenzeke kabusha.

And it's very nice outside.	Futhi kuhle kakhulu ngaphandle.

And up again.	Futhi phezulu futhi.
We all know why he did it.	Sonke siyazi ukuthi kungani akwenza.
He is an actor.	Ungumdlali.
He did not know that anyone knew.	Wayengazi ukuthi kukhona owaziyo.
This is probably better.	Lokhu mhlawumbe kungcono.
And that's all you get.	Futhi yilokho kuphela ukuthola.
This should be in the classroom.	Lokhu kumele kube ekilasini.
You eat food because you need to live.	Udla ukudla ngoba udinga ukuphila.
Maybe he, too.	Mhlawumbe naye, futhi.
The city is beautiful.	Muhle umuzi.
He travels a lot of people.	Uhamba abantu kakhulu.

This time he arrived on time.	Kulokhu wafika ngesikhathi.
Maybe it should be me.	Mhlawumbe kufanele kube yimina.
But he can't get out.	Kodwa akakwazi ukuphuma.

He was not so bad.	Wayengeyena omubi kangako.
I want to learn all about you.	Ngifuna ukufunda konke ngawe.
But he wasn't sure, he wasn't sure.	Kodwa wayengenaso isiqiniseko, wayengenaso isiqiniseko.

Death is one thing.	Ukufa yinto eyodwa.
Not because you want to die.	Hhayi ngoba ufuna ukufa.
You can't stay in the house all day.	Awukwazi ukuhlala endlini usuku lonke.

If that is true.	Uma lokho kuyiqiniso.
So that's not really a problem.	Ngakho lokho akuyona inkinga ngempela.
When he spoke to her.	Lapho ekhuluma naye.
He rarely gets out of bed.	Akavamile ukuphuma embhedeni.

It happened to me.	Kwenzeke kimi.
It is a real opportunity.	Ithuba impela.
Seeing my dog.	Ukubona inja yami.
However, entry was very difficult.	Noma kunjalo, ukungena kube nzima kakhulu.
This may be your problem.	Lokhu kungenzeka kube inkinga yakho.
You need a reason.	Udinga isizathu.
Absolutely not.	Kahle neze.
Still, this is very good.	Noma kunjalo, lokhu kuhle kakhulu.
Not you.	Akuyena wena.
Definitely with him, too.	Nakanjani naye, naye.
But maybe she is happy too.	Kodwa mhlawumbe naye ujabule.
My father came here years ago.	Ubaba wafika lapha eminyakeni edlule.
He did not, but he agreed.	Akazange, kodwa wavuma.
Nothing is so beautiful.	Ayikho into enhle kangaka.
Not just this time! 	Hhayi nje ngalesi sikhathi!
So yes, no.	Ngakho yebo, cha.
There is no one in the area.	Akukho muntu endaweni.
You want to do it right.	Ufuna ukukwenza kahle.
Yes, he did.	Yebo, wenze njalo.
Or, so it seems.	Noma, ngakho kubonakala.
Even that would be better.	Ngisho nalokho kungaba ngcono.
I do not understand how long.	Angiqondi ukuthi kuze kube nini.
Not that there is anything to be done about it right now.	Hhayi ukuthi kukhona okumele kwenziwe ngakho njengamanje.
He just came out at the end.	Wavele waphuma ekugcineni.
Everyone wants that thing.	Wonke umuntu ufuna leyo nto.
I do not know yet.	Angazi namanje.
And it's your fault.	Futhi iphutha lakho.
Too many, he thought.	Eziningi kakhulu, wacabanga.
And now it means nothing.	Futhi manje akusho lutho.
Finally he says it's time.	Ekugcineni uthi sekuyisikhathi.
Because now the problem.	Ngoba manje inkinga.
And he could see well.	Futhi wakwazi ukubona kahle.
But something is terribly wrong.	Kodwa kukhona okubi kakhulu.
And so, that's right.	Futhi ngakho, kunjalo.
It's almost me.	Cishe yimina.
I don't want you to go anywhere.	Angifuni ukuthi uye ndawo.
Sure, he did.	Impela, wakwenza.
Not a child, you.	Hhayi ingane, wena.
That's right, you know.	Kunjalo nje, uyazi.
I don't like it, though.	Angithandi, noma kunjalo.
And it had to be.	Futhi kwakufanele kube.
This is very true, too.	Lokhu kuyiqiniso kakhulu, futhi.
This he refused.	Lokhu wenqaba.
He wanted a problem.	Wayefuna inkinga.
He never made it easy.	Akazange akwenze kube lula.

We also want to hear from you.	Sifuna futhi ukuzwa kuwe.
I don’t know much about him myself.	Angazi kakhulu ngaye mina.
It has been my best friend ever since.	Kube umngane wami omuhle kusukela ngaleso sikhathi.
I arrived on time for school.	Ngifike ngesikhathi esikoleni.
I could not say anything about it at all.	Angikwazanga ukutshela lutho kukho nhlobo.
You have to be there anyway.	Kufanele ube lapho noma kunjalo.
And I'm happy, almost.	Futhi ngijabule, cishe.
Stop doing this.	Yeka ukwenza lokhu.
I can't find a big case against him.	Angikwazi ukuthola icala elikhulu ngaye.
One must speak the truth.	Umuntu kumele akhulume iqiniso.
I have been thinking this lately myself.	Bengilokhu ngicabanga lokhu kamuva nje mina.
Indeed, anything is possible.	Ngempela, konke kungenzeka.
I'm just trying to fix something here.	Ngizama nje ukulungisa okuthile lapha.
Wouldn't that be great.	Ngeke yini kube kuhle lokho.
You obviously did well.	Kusobala ukuthi wenza kahle.
No, he could not.	Cha, akakwazanga ukukwenza.
I just don't want you to leave.	Angifuni nje uhambe.
He said this happened many times.	Uthe lokhu kwenzeka kaningi.
Life does not mean anything.	Ukuphila akusho lutho.
Good, excellent job.	Muhle, umsebenzi omuhle kakhulu.
I'm talking to her.	Ngikhuluma naye.
But not as big as that.	Kodwa hhayi enkulu njengoba lapho.
He stays with me all the time.	Uhlala nami ngaso sonke isikhathi.
And he never told the truth.	Futhi akazange akhulume iqiniso.
But not up here.	Kodwa hhayi phezulu lapha.
He wanted to help you.	Wayefuna ukukusiza.
Months, at least.	Izinyanga, okungenani.
I made you do it.	Ngikwenze wakwenza.
It's not just him.	Akukhona nje kuye.
It doesn't mean you have to do that sitting.	Akusho ukuthi kufanele wenze leyo nto uhlezi.
He said that this was not true.	Wathi lokhu akulona iqiniso.
My family, or work.	Umndeni wami, noma umsebenzi.
He's just trying to find his way.	Uzama nje ukuthola indlela yakhe.
It had to be for me, just like me.	Kwakufanele kube kimi, njengami.
That's all you want to do.	Yilokho kuphela ofuna ukukwenza.
But think if you do.	Kodwa ake ucabange uma wenza kanjalo.
He doesn't really know much.	Empeleni akazi okuningi.
My problem is how.	Inkinga yami ukuthi kanjani.
And it had to be done every day.	Futhi kwakufanele kwenziwe nsuku zonke.
He walked around in the middle.	Wahamba wabheka phakathi.
But nothing at all.	Kodwa lutho lutho.
Not children! 	Hhayi izingane!
He stayed for a while.	Wahlala isikhashana nje.
Another great one.	Omunye omkhulu.
I wanted to hear everything.	Ngangifuna ukuzwa yonke into.
I felt his spirit.	Ngizwe umoya wakhe.
I would like to find out why.	Ngingathanda ukuthola ukuthi kungani.
It's just a matter of time.	Ukuthi nje isikhathi.
I have to do just that.	Kufanele ngenze lokho kanye.
I'd like to talk to him that's all.	Ngingathanda ukukhuluma naye yilokho kuphela.
His spirit is troubled.	Umoya wakhe ukhathazekile.
I blame my friend.	Ngisola umngane wami.
But, of course, it never happened.	Kodwa, kusobala, akuzange kwenzeke.
We were not alone yesterday.	Asizange sibe sodwa nje izolo.
He is present but not here.	Ukhona kodwa akekho lapha.
We know about you.	Siyazi ngawe.
He told mom last week.	Utshele umama ngesonto eledlule.
And he did it alone.	Futhi wakwenza lokho eyedwa.
But apparently man.	Kodwa ngokusobala umuntu.
I didn't know you could do that.	Bengingazi ukuthi ungakwenza lokho.
It can be up or down.	Kungaba phezulu noma phansi.
I thought about getting in.	Ngicabange ukungena.
You can't go wrong with that.	Ngeke wenze iphutha ngalokho.
I thought he was our boy.	Bengithi ungumfana wethu.
Work is slow.	Umsebenzi uhamba kancane.
Maybe we did.	Mhlawumbe senze.
Indeed, that is what happened.	Ngempela, lokho kwenzeka.
It will not be so easy.	Ngeke kube lula kangako.
He didn't know how he got there or anything.	Wayengazi ukuthi ufike kanjani lapho noma okunye.
That's what my family did.	Wenza kanjalo umndeni wami.
Everyone should go there.	Wonke umuntu kufanele aye lapho.
One, but not another.	Omunye, kodwa hhayi omunye.
If you want to stay with me, you probably should.	Uma ufuna ukuhlala nami, cishe kufanele.
It certainly looks like he is not at home right now.	Nakanjani kubukeka sengathi akekho ekhaya njengamanje.
What a church indeed.	Yeka isonto ngempela.
Nothing but me.	Akukho ngaphandle kwami.
He wanted to see what she looked like.	Wayefuna ukubona ukuthi ubukeka kanjani.
Me, not someone else.	Mina, hhayi omunye umuntu.
He heard the answer.	Wezwa impendulo.
So one noticed.	Ngakho omunye waqaphela.
He said that it was true.	Wathi lokho kuyiqiniso.
Too much, everywhere.	Kuningi kakhulu, yonke indawo.
Help me get there !.	Ngisize ngifike lapho!.
Not for us, our story.	Hhayi kithi, indaba yethu.
To say the least.	Ukusho .
You work hard at it.	Usebenza kanzima kukho.
As it really is.	Njengoba kunjalo ngempela.
Or almost everything.	Noma cishe zonke izinto.
But now, the problem.	Kodwa manje, inkinga.
You will not tell anyone what you have done.	Ngeke utshele muntu ukuthi wenzeni.
Maybe next year will be better.	Mhlawumbe ngonyaka ozayo uzoba ngcono.
Please, if you can.	Ngicela, uma ungakwazi.
He had to be able to control himself.	Kwakufanele akwazi ukuzibamba.
Not together, anyway.	Hhayi ndawonye, ​​noma kanjani.
And he would not be able to do it.	Futhi ubengeke akwazi ukukwenza.
Happy New Year.	Ngonyaka omusha.
He refused help.	Wenqaba usizo.
It should never have been.	Bekungafanele neze.
And to do it for him.	Futhi ukwenza kuye.
I'm doing this now.	Ngenza lokhu manje.
Very soon, actually.	Ngokushesha kakhulu, empeleni.
And no one else, like that.	Futhi akekho omunye, kanjalo.
Everything is true because it is true.	Konke kuyiqiniso ngoba kuyiqiniso.
And one, and another, and another.	Futhi omunye, futhi omunye, futhi omunye.
He wants none of us to have it.	Ufuna akekho kithi abe nakho.
You need help.	Udinga ukuthola usizo.
He did not mention that.	Akazange akhulume ngalokho.
He'll have to do it now.	Kuzofanele akwenze manje.
I think this could be the same thing.	Ngicabanga ukuthi lokhu kungaba into efanayo.
One has to stop the way.	Umuntu kumele ayeke indlela.
It should be done this way.	Kufanele kwenziwe ngale ndlela.
But you must go with us now.	Kodwa kuzomele uhambe nathi manje.
I mean, not really.	Ngisho, hhayi impela.
I did not want anyone to know the truth about me.	Ngangingafuni muntu azi iqiniso ngami.
Everything will be better.	Konke kuzoba ngcono.
I knew about that.	Ngangazi ngalokho.
He knows exactly what his name is.	Uyazi kahle ukuthi ubani igama lakhe.
My mother never wanted to leave.	Umama akakaze afune ukuhamba.
He is actually my best friend.	Empeleni umngane wami omkhulu.
It should be good to go that way.	Kumelwe kube kuhle ukuhamba kanjalo.
Not now and probably not always.	Hhayi manje futhi mhlawumbe hhayi njalo.
He was not alone.	Wayengeyena yedwa.
Dad returned to his desk.	Ubaba wabuyela etafuleni lakhe.
When you think about it, it is obvious.	Uma ucabanga ngakho, kusobala.
He had a bad time with it.	Waba nesikhathi esibi ngakho.
Everyone wants their money.	Wonke umuntu ufuna imali yakhe.
Her doctor says she should.	Udokotela wakhe uthi kufanele.
It is not his fault at all.	Akulona iphutha lakhe nakancane.
He is not a big money maker.	Akuyena owenza imali omkhulu.
Very much, if any.	Kakhulu, uma kukhona.
I hope he also does better or better.	Ngethemba ukuthi naye wenza kahle noma ngcono.
He could not make himself say.	Akakwazanga ukuzenza ukusho.
I don't really know how it happened.	Angazi ngempela ukuthi kwenzeke kanjani.
And not just any money.	Futhi hhayi nje noma iyiphi imali.
You know, it's good for him.	Uyazi, kuhle kuye.
You should go! ' 	Kufanele uhambe!'
You must be there.	Kufanele ngabe ukhona.
He was not a father.	Wayengeyena ubaba.
But you will not find your way.	Kodwa ngeke uthole indlela yakho .
He thinks fast.	Ucabanga ngokushesha.
I've never been there myself.	Angikaze ngiye lapho mina.
But nowhere.	Kodwa akukho ndawo.
I thought he was coming.	Bengicabanga ukuthi uzofika.
We both want the truth.	Sobabili sifuna iqiniso.
He immediately requested a decision.	Wacela isinqumo ngokushesha.
It has to be me.	Kufanele abe yimina.
I hope it gets better for you.	Ngethemba ukuthi kuzoba ngcono kuwe.
I'm sure.	Ngiyaqiniseka.
The problem, he says.	Inkinga, uthi.
He can't talk about me.	Ngeke akwazi ukukhuluma ngami.
You are not someone else.	Awuyena omunye umuntu.
Something has to be done, now.	Kukhona okumele kwenziwe, manje.
So, too.	Ngakho, futhi.
I want everything right.	Ngifuna konke kulungile.
He wanted to take it.	Wayefuna ukuthatha.
To tell you the truth.	Ukukutshela iqiniso.
Still he stayed.	Noma kunjalo wahlala.
He wondered if he could control himself.	Wazibuza ukuthi angakwazi yini ukuzibamba.
I think sometimes too much.	Ngicabanga ngezinye izikhathi kakhulu.
Dad started drinking when he got home today.	Ubaba waqala ukuphuza efika nje ekhaya namuhla.
The choice is simple.	Ukukhetha kube lula.
Yes, that's all.	Yebo, yilokho kuphela.
That's all right.	Kulungile ngokuphelele.
I think he was a little surprised.	Ngicabanga ukuthi wamangala kancane.
Dad knows better.	Ubaba wazi kangcono.
To know where he should go.	Ukuze azi ukuthi kufanele aye kuphi.
That's what my mother did.	Wenze njalo umama.
And what a wonderful idea.	Futhi yeka umqondo omuhle.
I think it is absolutely true.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kuyiqiniso ngokuphelele.
He never talked about it.	Akazange akhulume nhlobo ngayo.
Maybe something is me.	Mhlawumbe okuthile yimi.
And he spoke to me.	Futhi wakhuluma kimi.
He can't sit down.	Akakwazi ukuhlala phansi.
He thought he should do it.	Wayecabanga ukuthi akwenze.
But not at night, no.	Kodwa hhayi ebusuku, cha.
Anyway, more on that later.	Noma kunjalo, okuningi ngalokho kamuva.
I wish it were so.	Ngingathanda kube kanjalo.
So nothing much happened at that time.	Ngakho akukho okuningi okwenzeka ngaleso sikhathi.
This could be him.	Lokhu kungaba nguye.
A little reading.	Ukufunda kancane.
Or maybe he never learned how.	Noma mhlawumbe akazange afunde ukuthi kanjani.
I would love to be with you there.	Ngingathanda ukuba nawe lapho.
I mean really great.	Ngisho okukhulu ngempela.
He lives here at home.	Uhlala lapha ekhaya.
Still, I think that is not true.	Noma kunjalo, ngicabanga ukuthi akulona iqiniso.
His music, his.	Umculo wakhe, wakhe.
I never got help with my homework.	Angizange ngithole usizo ngomsebenzi wami wesikole.
I found a picture of her.	Ngithole isithombe sakhe.
Not because of him but because of him.	Hhayi ngenxa yakhe kodwa ngenxa yakhe.
She's fine.	Uhlale kahle.
He did not go home very much.	Akazange aye ekhaya kakhulu.
All the time now.	Sonke isikhathi manje.
He went to work on time.	Waya emsebenzini ngesikhathi.
He says so, too.	Ukhuluma kanjalo, futhi.
We can't wait to get married.	Asikwazi ukulinda ukushada.
It would be nice to make that happen.	Kungaba kuhle ukwenza lokho kwenzeke.
Let me see how you do it.	Ake ngibone ukuthi wenza kanjani.
He knew everything.	Wayazi yonke into .
I could not get out of my house.	Angikwazanga ukuphuma endlini yami.
You want to be a better person.	Ufuna ukuba umuntu ongcono.
And now she is very happy.	Futhi manje ujabule kakhulu.
Let's find out more.	Ake sithole okwengeziwe.
I want to see his response to you.	Ngifuna ukubona impendulo yakhe kuwe.
I wanted to go to prison.	Ngangifuna ukuya ejele.
He will not speak.	Ngeke akhulume.
You really work on it.	Usebenza ngempela kukho.
Almost no one knows.	Cishe akekho owaziyo.
I wonder if that is true.	Kazi kuyiqiniso yini lokho.
I want to do everything right.	Ngifuna ukukwenza konke ngendlela efanele.
Not just music but.	Hhayi nje umculo kodwa.
This obviously should not happen.	Lokhu ngokusobala akufanele kwenzeke.
You are not where you are.	Akukho lapho ukhona.
Yes, it seems.	Yebo, kubonakala kunjalo.
He is lying on my bed.	Ulele embhedeni wami.
Also, thank you very much for your time.	Futhi, ngiyabonga kakhulu ngesikhathi sakho.
So it is with me.	Kunjalo kimi.
I say that in a big way.	Ngisho lokho ngendlela enkulu.
All good!!.	Konke kuhle!!.
It can be up to three weeks.	Kungaba amasonto amathathu.
And last night.	Futhi izolo ebusuku.
Eating right.	Ukudla ngendlela efanele.
That doesn't exist right now.	Lokho akukho njengamanje.
And everyone knows who he is.	Futhi wazi wonke umuntu ukuthi ubani.
I will have to go.	Kuzodingeka ngihambe.
But don't forget, we can't get out of here.	Kodwa ungakhohlwa, asikwazi ukuphuma lapha.
One of mine.	Omunye wami.
You can always get back to it.	Ungakwazi njalo ukubuyela kukho.
And he works hard.	Futhi usebenza kanzima.
He wanted to know.	Wayefuna wazi.
That is what people do in your home.	Yilokho okwenziwa abantu ekhaya lakho.
It has been better for me.	Kube ngcono kimi.
And you need to know why.	Futhi udinga ukwazi ukuthi kungani.
He just can't say.	Akakwazi nje ukusho.
I said yes immediately.	Ngathi yebo ngokushesha.
You don’t really need it anyway.	Awudingi ngempela noma kunjalo.
He said to me.	Wathi kimi.
My mother did the same.	Naye umama wenza kanjalo.
Man does not have it.	Umuntu akanayo.
I do not know who the father is.	Angazi ukuthi ubani ubaba.
He can't be that.	Angeke abe yilokho.
I try everything.	Ngizama konke.
He left immediately.	Ahambe ngokushesha.
I will always be.	ngizoba njalo.
Not on time, though.	Hhayi ngesikhathi, noma kunjalo.
My mother.	Umama wami .
It has to be, of course.	Kufanele kube njalo, kunjalo.
He should never have come.	Kwakungafanele neze afike.
He didn't think he could do it.	Wayengacabangi ukuthi angakwenza.
So much for lately.	Kuningi ngakho muva nje.
I do not love anyone but you.	Angithandi omunye umuntu ngaphandle kwakho.
Obviously, the problem.	Ngokusobala, inkinga.
I knew a lot.	Ngangazi kakhulu.
Exactly right ?.	Kahle kahle yini?.
But finding the money to do so has been difficult.	Kodwa ukuthola imali yokwenza lokho kube nzima.
I never want it to happen.	Angifuni neze kwenzeke.
No one knows if this happened without you.	Akekho owaziyo ukuthi lokhu kwenzeke ngaphandle kwakho.
You will know, okay.	Uzokwazi, kulungile.
He did not know where or why.	Wayengazi ukuthi kuphi noma ngani.
The way you did it now.	Indlela owenze ngayo manje.
He should definitely eat.	Kumele nakanjani adle.
But now, I think about it.	Kodwa manje, ngicabanga ngakho.
Maybe that's me.	Mhlawumbe yimi lowo.
But he obviously looked.	Kodwa kusobala ukuthi wabheka.
In fact, he just walked away.	Empeleni, wavele wahamba.
You do not want to see photos.	Awufuni ukubona izithombe.
I need help, here.	Ngidinga usizo, lapha.
I just want to get some sleep.	Ngifuna nje ukulala kancane.
But not all the way.	Kodwa hhayi yonke indlela.
I mean, no one but you.	Ngisho, akekho omunye ngaphandle kwakho.
Not outside.	Cha nje.
I did the same.	Nami ngenza kanjalo.
But it is just possible.	Kodwa kungenzeka nje.
This is me .	Yimi lo .
But not yet.	Kodwa akunjalo okwamanje.
But it may be necessary.	Kodwa kungase kudingeke .
His eyes.	Amehlo akhe .
But yes.	Kodwa yebo.
Doing this for the first time can be difficult.	Ukwenza lokhu okokuqala kungaba nzima.
I wanted to be with you.	Bengifuna ukuba nawe.
I can't help you with that.	Angikwazi ukukusiza ngalokho.
Now you want to get out.	Manje ufuna ukuphuma.
He thought of getting out.	Wacabanga ukuphuma.
This he could not do.	Lokhu akakwazanga ukukwenza.
Nice to talk to you again.	Ngiyajabula ukukhuluma nawe futhi.
You really shouldn’t do this.	Akufanele ngempela ukwenze lokhu.
You just don't look like yourself.	Awubonakali nje wena.
And you got the same answer.	Futhi uthole impendulo efanayo.
I'm not entirely sure about that.	Angiqiniseki ngokuphelele ngakho.
That happened is not true.	Lokho kwenzeka akulona iqiniso.
He thought of something else.	Wacabanga okunye.
Not a fool himself.	Hhayi isilima yena.
I thought better.	Ngicabange kangcono.
He did very well in college.	Wenza kahle kakhulu ekolishi.
So you got an error.	Ngakho uthole iphutha.
My fault for that.	Iphutha lami kulokho.
It's your truth.	Kuyiqiniso lakho.
Now he spoke.	Manje wakhuluma.
I don’t know how you learn to do that.	Angazi ukuthi ufunda kanjani ukwenza lokho.
I hope you can too.	Ngethemba ukuthi nawe ungakwenza.
I have never heard of him.	Nami angikaze ngizwe ngaye.
Maybe not soon.	Mhlawumbe hhayi ngokushesha.
Probably always.	Mhlawumbe njalo.
I just do this.	Ngenza lokhu nje.
I had to go alone.	Kwadingeka ngihambe ngedwa.
A few years later another child.	Eminyakeni embalwa kamuva enye ingane.
And it is quite true.	Futhi kuyiqiniso impela.
I saw one this morning, actually.	Ngibone enye namhlanje ekuseni, empeleni.
Not a big question.	Akuwona umbuzo omkhulu.
He says there will never be another.	Uthi ngeke aphinde abe khona omunye.
He stayed that way.	Wahlala kunjalo.
There are flaws in it, of course.	Kukhona amaphutha kukho, kunjalo.
This is not the case.	Akukhona lokhu.
I wanted to do something about it.	Ngangifuna ukwenza okuthile ngakho.
It will probably be much better.	Cishe kuzoba ngcono kakhulu.
And it never was.	Futhi akuzange kube njalo.
I want you here with me.	Ngifuna wena lapha nami.
I do not know now.	Angazi manje .
Yes, you came last night.	Yebo, ufike izolo ebusuku.
Everyone thought the worst.	Wonke umuntu wacabanga okubi kakhulu.
It happened this week.	Kwenzeke kuleli sonto .
That you went and saw.	Ukuthi uhambe wabona.
I think, not yet, not soon.	Ngicabanga ukuthi, hhayi okwamanje, hhayi maduze.
Apparently not.	Kubonakala sengathi akunjalo.
And he is not such a good friend.	Futhi akuyena umngane omuhle kangako.
It would be good for us.	Kungaba kuhle kithi.
Please help if you know.	Ngicela usizo uma wazi.
Yes, thank you very much.	Yebo, ngiyabonga kakhulu.
But that is not and is not there.	Kodwa lokho akuyena futhi akukho lapho.
Yes, this too is real.	Yebo, nalokhu kwenzeka ngempela.
It's not really his fault.	Akulona iphutha lakhe ngempela.
Apparently he could not see this.	Ngokusobala akakwazanga ukukubona lokhu.
He wanted to say.	Wayefuna ukusho.
Yes, sometimes it is difficult.	Yebo, ngezinye izikhathi kunzima.
And so it is, a lie.	Futhi kunjalo, amanga.
You should know about this.	Kufanele wazi ngale nto.
Everything else looks like before.	Konke okunye kubonakala njengakuqala.
We did a good job at that.	Senze umsebenzi omuhle ngalokho.
Good work so far.	Muhle umsebenzi kuze kube manje.
It's not just how you feel now.	Akukhona nje ukuthi uzizwa kanjani manje.
He knew he would not.	Wayazi ukuthi ngeke.
Of course, we cannot do that.	Yebo, ngeke sikwenze lokho.
Very good way.	Indlela enhle kakhulu.
No one else.	Akekho omunye futhi.
This is my gift.	Lesi isipho sami.
Anything bad.	Noma yini embi.
Many, many things.	Izinto eziningi, eziningi.
But it has to be this way.	Kodwa kufanele kube ngale ndlela.
Maybe he went alone.	Mhlawumbe wahamba yedwa.
I mean he didn't have time.	Ngisho ukuthi wayengenaso isikhathi.
She was always well dressed.	Wayegqoke kahle ngaso sonke isikhathi.
And when.	Futhi nini .
Flowers.	Izimbali .
My view is to move on.	Umbono wami uthi ukuqhubeka.
I need something.	Ngidinga okuthile .
Good for you.	Kuhle ngani.
I can make it happen.	Ngingakwenza kwenzeke.
Time to know.	Isikhathi sokuthi azi.
He held a meeting.	Wenza umhlangano.
He just wasn't there.	Wayengekho nje .
But no one should know.	Kodwa akekho okufanele azi.
If you do this.	Uma wenza lokhu.
That is difficult right now.	Kunzima lokho njengamanje.
He got better.	Waba ngcono.
Tall, too.	Mude, futhi.
They stay together.	Ahlale ndawonye.
Every day he does something for me.	Nsuku zonke wenza okuthile ngami.
Good to try.	Kuhle ukuzama.
Not a book.	Hhayi incwadi.
I don't see anyone but.	Angiboni muntu kodwa.
Pretend he's not here.	Enza sengathi akekho lapha.
And many times since.	Futhi izikhathi eziningi kusukela lapho.
No, not at all for me.	Cha, akunjalo kimi.
This does not have to be.	Lokhu akudingeki kube njalo.
He could not do this with him here.	Akakwazanga ukwenza lokhu naye lapha.
He felt life.	Wezwa ukuphila.
I have seen too many.	Ngibone abaningi kakhulu.
I doubt you exist.	Ngiyangabaza ukuthi ukhona.
It can't be that, really.	Ngeke kube yilokho, ngempela.
Maybe, he is asleep.	Mhlawumbe, ulele.
He started living with us.	Waqala ukuhlala nathi.
No, he did not.	Cha ngempela, wakwenza.
But this is not always the case.	Kodwa lokhu akunjalo ngaso sonke isikhathi.
But he did this.	Kodwa ukwenzile lokhu.
He knew he had to leave but he did not.	Wayazi ukuthi kufanele ahambe kodwa akazange.
Either way, you will get better at it.	Noma iyiphi indlela, uzoba ngcono kukho.
So do not forget.	Ngakho ungakhohlwa.
But there! 	Kodwa lapho!
We will not be here long.	Ngeke sibe lapha isikhathi eside.
I do not believe it will happen.	Angikholwa ukuthi kuzokwenzeka.
Nothing more here.	Akukho okunye lapha.
Still it seems to me.	Noma kunjalo kubonakala kimi.
I really hope he will make it happen.	Ngethemba ngempela ukuthi uzokwenza kwenzeke.
You should go with him.	Kufanele uhambe naye.
But everyone knows that right now.	Kodwa wonke umuntu uyakwazi lokho okwamanje.
Maybe he'll leave then.	Mhlawumbe uzohamba ngaleso sikhathi.
This he should not have done.	Lokhu bekungafanele akwenze.
Do you want to continue ?.	Uyafuna ukuqhubeka?.
But that is true of all reasoning.	Kodwa lokho kuyiqiniso kukho konke ukucabanga.
In the car you would have done well.	Emotweni ngabe wenze kahle.
But that would be a bad answer.	Kodwa lokho kungaba impendulo embi.
I can't drive a car.	Angikwazi ukushayela imoto.

You did not know what was coming.	Ubungazi ukuthi yini ezayo.
Or my food.	Noma ukudla kwami.
Maybe the boy lives upstairs.	Mhlawumbe umfana uhlala phezulu.
He looked like that.	Wayebonakala kanjalo.

But obviously it is possible.	Kodwa ngokusobala kungenzeka.

He does not have a gun.	Akanaso isibhamu.
Not just this.	Hhayi nje kulokhu.
Themba agreed to do it.	UThemba wavuma ukwenza.
Same way, every day.	Indlela efanayo, nsuku zonke.
He did not do one thing at a time.	Akazange enze into eyodwa ngesikhathi.
So maybe this is not for everyone.	Ngakho mhlawumbe lokhu akuwona wonke umuntu.
He could not.	Akazange akwazi.
I'll go now, he thought.	Ngizohamba manje, wacabanga.
Really good thing.	Into enhle ngempela.

I'm going to work tomorrow.	Ngiya emsebenzini kusasa.
Not if we do something about it.	Hhayi uma senza okuthile ngakho.
He saw now that it was a boy.	Wabona manje ukuthi umfana.
I've always known that.	Bengilokhu ngikwazi lokho.
This is even more true than that.	Lokhu kuyiqiniso kakhulu kunalokho.
He left today.	Uhambe namuhla.
I could not do that.	Angikwazanga ukwenza kanjalo.
We need more space.	Sidinga indawo enkulu.
It will be soon.	Kuzoba maduze.
Now we need to find out why.	Manje sidinga ukuthola ukuthi kungani.

So, you did well.	Ngakho, wenze kahle.
No, last week, actually.	Cha, ngesonto eledlule, empeleni.
You do not have to say one thing.	Akumele usho into eyodwa.
Not so with us.	Nathi akunjalo.
He knew he could do better.	Wayazi ukuthi angakwenza kangcono.
I don’t really want to get into it.	Angifuni ngempela ukungena kukho.
It will not, it will not.	Ngeke, ngeke.
At least not that you know.	Okungenani hhayi ukuthi uyakwazi.
But there is still time.	Kodwa kusenesikhathi.
We have a lot to do.	Kuningi okufanele sikwenze.
You know something is going on.	Uyazi kukhona okwenzekayo.

Or not, actually.	Noma akunjalo, empeleni.
I just want to play music.	Ngifuna nje ukudlala umculo.
So, a hat.	Ngakho, isigqoko.
A bad person.	Umuntu omubi.
I can’t imagine how you feel or how you feel.	Angikwazi ukucabanga ukuthi uzizwa kanjani noma ukuthi uzizwa kanjani.
But you know everything about it.	Kodwa wazi konke ngakho.
Instead, both.	Kunalokho, bobabili.
He wanted something else from her.	Wayefuna enye into kuye.
Because it had to.	Ngoba kwakufanele.
And really nice.	Futhi enhle ngempela.
Stop holding back.	Yeka ukuzibamba.
But he would not learn anything.	Kodwa wayengeke afunde lutho.
Now things now.	Manje izinto manje.
You just have to be.	Kufanele ube nje.
But not for years.	Kodwa hhayi iminyaka.
Probably a great dad.	Cishe ubaba omkhulu.
That will not happen, time.	Lokho ngeke kwenzeke, isikhathi.
He saw that it was really him.	Wabona ukuthi nguye ngempela.
He certainly will.	Impela uzokwenza njalo.
We need pictures.	Sidinga izithombe.
He wanted more.	Wayefuna ezinye izinto eziningi.
He readily agreed with me.	Wavuma nami ngaso leso sikhathi.
That is not the place for me.	Akukhona lokho le ndawo kimi.
And you probably can.	Futhi kungenzeka ukuthi ungakwenza.
But you will do the same.	Kodwa nawe uzokwenza kanjalo.
No story here.	Ayikho indaba lapha.
Not that it should.	Hhayi ukuthi bekufanele.
You don't want to think about it.	Awufuni ukucabanga ngakho.
The door did not lock.	Umnyango awuzange ukhiye.

Nothing bad happens at all.	Akukho okubi okwenzekayo nhlobo.
Or even hours.	Noma ngisho amahora.
You know nothing but pretend you do.	Awazi lutho kodwa wenza sengathi uyazi.
You have done that before.	Uke wakwenza lokho ngaphambili.
Good on that.	Kuhle kulokho.
We do things together.	Senza izinto ndawonye.
If you did, you should tell me.	Uma ukwenzile, kufanele ungitshele.
Not just in his house.	Hhayi nje endlini yakhe.
He never thought of her.	Akazange acabange ngaye.

No, not alone.	Hhayi, hhayi yedwa.
Of course he could not see you.	Yebo akakwazanga ukukubona.
Learning to read just.	Ukufunda ukufunda nje.

Not a good sound.	Hhayi umsindo omuhle.
Tell me why you want to go.	Ngitshele ukuthi kungani ufuna ukuhamba.
He flatly refused.	Wenqaba impela.
I did not tell anyone.	Angizange ngitshele muntu.

So there is that possibility.	Ngakho kukhona lokho kungenzeka.
Someone had to do all that.	Kwakufanele othile enze konke lokho.
It is not the only thing there.	Akuyona kuphela into lapho.

And no one.	Futhi akekho umuntu.
That is not the case today.	Lokho akukhona okwenzeka namuhla.
Everyone should be out now.	Wonke umuntu kufanele abe ngaphandle manje.
So you will need a dress.	Ngakho uzodinga ingubo.
I said, not so much.	Ngathi, hhayi kakhulu.
Down to the top.	Phansi phezulu.
And that's your person.	Futhi ungumuntu wakho lowo.
He came and sat down with me.	Weza wahlala nami.
Man does all he can.	Umuntu wenza konke angakwenza.
There is danger there.	Kukhona ingozi lapho.
But man cannot.	Kodwa umuntu angeke.

Maybe still.	Mhlawumbe namanje.
Life is with you or without you.	Ukuphila kukhona nawe noma ngaphandle kwakho.

So, really, it is nothing.	Ngakho, empeleni, akuyona lutho.
So it must have been.	Ngakho kumelwe ukuba kwenzeka kanjalo.
He later realized the pain.	Kamuva waqaphela ubuhlungu.
Book if right.	Incwadi uma kulungile.
You have been very busy for a very long time.	Ube matasa kakhulu isikhathi eside kakhulu.
The meeting was very good.	Umhlangano ube muhle kakhulu.
You do not know, do you? 	Awazi, akunjalo?
He knew you were not human.	Wayazi ukuthi awuyena umuntu.
I will not do that to him yet.	Ngeke ngikwenze lokho kuye kodwa.
So it has to be something like that.	Ngakho kufanele kube into enjalo.
Enough time to go a long way.	Isikhathi esanele sokuthi sihambe isikhathi eside.

Maybe he's better than me.	Mhlawumbe ungcono kunami.

But it is not and you know it.	Kodwa akunjalo futhi uyazi.
He knows everything.	Uyazi konke.

I thought he would do it, though.	Bengicabanga ukuthi uzokwenza, noma kunjalo.
Sometimes for years.	Ngezinye izikhathi iminyaka.
When that happened.	Lapho lokho kwenzeka.
And that's my mother.	Futhi umama wami lowo.

But it is not just death.	Kodwa akukhona nje ukufa.
Thobile sat down.	UThobile wahlala phansi.
It's a very bad thing.	Yinto embi kakhulu.
He is very rare.	Akavamile neze.
Not to be someone else, but to be you.	Hhayi ukuba omunye umuntu, kodwa ukuba wena.
We probably want the same thing.	Cishe sifuna into efanayo.
But it should not, not today.	Kodwa bekungafanele, hhayi namuhla.

And you will not be alone there.	Futhi ngeke ube wedwa lapho.
Doing things the right way.	Ukwenza izinto ngendlela efanele.
I don't want to get into that.	Angifuni ukungena kulokho.
I could not say why.	Angikwazanga ukusho ukuthi kungani.
Let me tell you more about myself.	Ake ngikutshele okwengeziwe ngami.
I'm not entirely sure about this.	Angiqiniseki ngokuphelele ngalokhu.
You want too many things.	Ufuna izinto eziningi kakhulu.
I did not know what to do.	Ngangingazi ukuthi ngenzeni mina.
I knew what I had to do.	Ngangazi ukuthi yini okufanele ngiyenze.
He thought he had told me too much.	Wayecabanga ukuthi ungitshele kakhulu.

Not so, now.	Akunjalo, manje.
We do today.	Senza namuhla.

All you really have to do is.	Konke okumele ukwenze ngempela.
This is your way of doing just that.	Lena indlela yakho yokwenza lokho kanye.
I do not know what happened.	Angazi kwenzakalani.
But he wishes he could do it.	Kodwa ufisa sengathi angakwenza.
At that time nothing more was needed.	Ngaleso sikhathi akukho okunye okwakudingeka.
Yes it can be difficult.	Yebo kungaba nzima.
I just need to get out of here.	Ngidinga nje ukuphuma lapha.
It really can only be better.	Ngempela kungaba ngcono kuphela.
This must happen.	Lokhu kumele kwenzeke.
But it may not have happened at all.	Kodwa kungenzeka ukuthi akuzange kwenzeke.

That's just it.	Lokho nje.
Ma says so.	UMa usho njalo.
That's one thing.	Yilokho into eyodwa lokho.

He did.	Wenza .
I doubt you know.	Ngiyangabaza ukuthi uyazi.
And he knew a lot.	Futhi wayazi okuningi.
But even so, owning one is still beyond the reach of the average person.	Kodwa noma kunjalo, kunzima ukuthola imali eyanele.
He tried his best to reach her.	Wazama angakwenza ukuze afike kuye.
Obviously, something had to be done, and done quickly.	Ngokusobala, okuthile kwakufanele kwenziwe, futhi kwenziwe ngokushesha.

And it is good to have you at home.	Futhi kuhle ukuba nawe ekhaya.

I wish there was a plan.	Sengathi kukhona icebo.
We need your help right away.	Sidinga usizo lwakho ngokushesha.
Anyway really.	Noma kunjalo ngempela.

You did a good job with him.	Wenze umsebenzi omuhle naye.
Not just for us.	Hhayi nje ngathi.
Or not always.	Noma hhayi njalo.
That is our message.	Lowo umlayezo wethu.
I'm not really sure how.	Angiqiniseki ngempela ukuthi kanjani.
But no, that's not my problem.	Kodwa cha, akuyona inkinga yami leyo.
And, and it is very true.	Futhi, futhi kuyiqiniso kakhulu.
If he does this, he can do this.	Uma enza lokhu, uyakwazi ukwenza lokhu.
That just might be better.	Ukuthi nje kungaba ngcono kangcono.
If you plan to stay in your room do not.	Uma uhlela ukuhlala ekamelweni lakho ungakwenzi.
I saw a lot of people.	Ngabona abantu abaningi.

I love everything about you.	Ngithanda yonke into ngawe.
It can be very helpful.	Kungaba usizo kakhulu.

No matter how masculine you are.	Noma ngabe uyindoda kangakanani.
And he wanted to get rid of her.	Futhi wayefuna ukuqeda ngaye.
But in the end he did not do this.	Kodwa ekugcineni akazange akwenze lokhu.
I have never talked about this.	Angikaze ngikhulume ngalokhu.
He gave advice.	Wanikeza iseluleko.
I can't wait to see more photos.	Angisakwazi ukulinda ukubona ezinye izithombe.
I have always felt the same way really.	Bengilokhu ngizizwa ngendlela efanayo ngempela.
And everything, really.	Nakho konke, ngempela.
It is very difficult for him.	Kunzima kakhulu kuye.
Do it again tomorrow.	Ukwenze futhi kusasa.
You are so much better there.	Ungcono kakhulu lapho.
He took some pictures.	Wathatha ezinye izithombe.
Isn't that right? ' 	Akunjalo?'
I wanted to know.	Ngangifuna ukwazi.
I don't want to talk to him, obviously.	Angifuni ukukhuluma naye, ngokusobala.
You need a family.	Udinga umndeni.
But he noticed.	Kodwa waqaphela.
I'm so sorry for him.	Ngiyaxolisa kakhulu ngaye.
So we had to do it.	Ngakho kwadingeka senze kanjalo.
But he decided to find out.	Kodwa wanquma ukuthola.
You can't drive.	Awukwazi ukushayela.
Once in a while now.	Kanye ngesikhathi manje.
Death is like that.	Ukufa kunjalo.
Not three years.	Hhayi iminyaka emithathu.
He has never been.	Akakaze abe khona.
I can't take anything for granted.	Angikwazi ukuthatha lutho kalula.
You would not expect anything else.	Ubungeke ulindele noma yini enye.
He was not at work.	Wayengekho emsebenzini.
He made a very big impression.	Wenza umbono omkhulu kakhulu.
Everyone did that.	Wonke umuntu wakwenza lokho.
He told me about his work.	Wangitshela ngomsebenzi wakhe.
Even if you want me to do it.	Noma ngabe ufuna ngikwenze.
No, no.	Akunjalo, cha.
Where would you like to go?	Ungathanda ukuya kuphi.
Not better not.	Hhayi kungcono hhayi.
It may be a slow walk.	Kungase kube ukuhamba kancane.
He did not want to go without her.	Wayengafuni ahambe ngaphandle kwakhe.
It will take three.	Kuzothatha ezintathu.
And she is beautiful to me.	Futhi muhle kimi.
But there is no such thing here.	Kodwa ayikho into enjalo lapha.
But so do we.	Kodwa nathi futhi.
He can be there now.	Angaba khona manje.
He always eats.	Udla njalo yena.
The big thing here is to learn to stop.	Okukhulu lapha ukufunda ukuyeka.
I think that's the answer.	Ngicabanga ukuthi impendulo.
But it did not have to be this way.	Kodwa bekungafanele kube njalo.
Probably not always.	Mhlawumbe hhayi njalo.
That is not the case at all.	Akuyona leyo ndlela nhlobo.
No one should learn anything.	Akekho okufanele afunde lutho.
A quick afternoon walk is best.	Ukuhamba ngokushesha ntambama kungcono kakhulu.
You may like that.	Ungathanda lokho .
Nothing more yet.	Akukho okunye okwamanje.
But he will do this.	Kodwa uzokwenza lokhu.
It's not dangerous, maybe a little bit.	Akuyona ingozi, mhlawumbe kancane kancane.
Very, very sometimes.	Kakhulu, ngezinye izikhathi.
He too could not do it.	Naye akakwazanga ukwenza.
I am happy to be a teacher.	Ngiyajabula ukuba uthisha.
His father did not know what to do.	Ubaba wakhe wayengazi ukuthi enzeni.
I never want that to happen.	Angifuni neze lokho kwenzeke.
I just wish you stayed where you are.	Ngifisa nje ukuthi uhlale lapho ukhona.
But there is pain.	Kodwa kukhona ubuhlungu.
That may be all.	Lokho kungase kube konke.
Everything, really.	Konke, ngempela.
But, it can be easy.	Kodwa, kungaba lula.
My father told me this.	Ubaba wangitshela lokhu.
It will not happen to him.	Ngeke kwenzeke kuye.
And yes, it is possible.	Futhi yebo, kungenzeka.
If he leaves, it will not be good.	Uma ehamba, ngeke kube kuhle.
But no, he has to learn.	Kodwa cha, kumele afunde.
Long-term performance.	Ukusebenza isikhathi eside.
I do not have to wait long.	Akumele ngilinde isikhathi eside.
It's ours.	Yinto yethu.
I don’t really know what to do about it.	Angazi ngempela ukuthi ngenzeni ngakho.
I think you did a great job.	Ngicabanga ukuthi wenze umsebenzi omkhulu.
I can't think of a job right now.	Ngeke ngicabange ngomsebenzi njengamanje.
She is afraid to be alone.	Wesaba ukuba yedwa.
Really, no.	Ngempela, cha.
Everyone will be better.	Wonke umuntu uzoba ngcono.
I think this will always happen.	Ngicabanga ukuthi lokhu kuzokwenzeka njalo.
No, not much.	Cha, akukho okuningi.
He should stay here.	Kufanele ahlale lapha.
Done at night.	Kwenziwe ebusuku.
Only this once.	Kuphela lokhu kanye.
I have to do something about it.	Kufanele ngenze okuthile ngakho.
He just spoke, and thought, the way he did.	Wavele wakhuluma, futhi wacabanga, indlela enza ngayo.
First, there may be a choice.	Okokuqala, ukukhetha kungase kube khona.
And sometimes nothing else.	Futhi ngezinye izikhathi akukho okunye okunye.
Sunday morning the same thing.	NgeSonto ekuseni into efanayo.
But if you are afraid.	Kodwa uma wesaba .
This may be difficult for you to do.	Lokhu kungase kube nzima kuwe ukukwenza.
At first, he did just that.	Ekuqaleni, wakwenza.
My mother told me.	Wangitshela umama.
I'm too scared to tell everyone.	Ngesaba kakhulu ukutshela wonke umuntu.
I'll have to get another one.	Kuzofanele ngithole enye.
But not as you did.	Kodwa hhayi njengoba wenza.
Sometimes, you will not.	Ngezinye izikhathi, ngeke.
And apparently that's him.	Futhi ngokusobala lokho kuye .
And the food is really good.	Futhi ukudla kuhle ngempela.
And that is hard to do.	Futhi lokho kunzima ukukwenza.
Just playing is like that.	Ukudlala nje kunjalo.
I always know that.	Ngihlala ngikwazi lokho.
He had to learn everything.	Kwakufanele afunde konke.
This time he sat down.	Kulokhu wahlala phansi.
Not when I want it all the way.	Hhayi lapho engifuna ngayo yonke indlela.
Some of you seem to be right.	Okunye kwakho kubonakala kuyiqiniso.
Life is too hard to live.	Ukuphila kunzima kakhulu ukuphila.
It's actually good.	Empeleni kuhle.
Do something else.	Ingabe okunye.
I couldn't quite figure this out.	Angikwazanga ukuthola kahle lokhu.
But she is happy almost always.	Kodwa uyajabula cishe ngaso sonke isikhathi.
Everyone was amazed at it.	Wonke umuntu wamangala ngakho.
I couldn't do that, either.	Angikwazanga ukwenza lokho, nami.
He must arrive immediately.	Kumele afike ngokushesha.
Also, his age.	Futhi, iminyaka yakhe.
No, we really can't do that.	Cha, empeleni ngeke sikwenze lokho.
I will not go with you.	Ngeke ngihambe nawe.
And so we had to go.	Futhi ngakho kwadingeka sihambe.
But, of course, you know that.	Kodwa, kunjalo, uyakwazi lokho.
What should I do.	Kumele ngenzeni.
I know that.	Ngiyazi kanjalo.
A good marriage.	Umshado omuhle.
I just need to talk.	Ngidinga nje ukukhuluma.
He thought a lie.	Wacabanga amanga.
The mother will not be tall.	Umama ngeke abe mude.
You are my student.	Ungumfundi wami.
I wanted him to do that.	Bengifuna enze njalo.
Not if, when.	Hhayi uma, nini.
I know, my evil one.	Ngiyazi, omubi wami.
I mean, he did.	Ngisho, wakwenza.
I can't find food.	Angikwazi ukuthola ukudla.
I would not get it.	Bengingeke ngithole.
And you can't get out !!!.	Futhi awukwazi ukuphuma !!!.
I just want to get better.	Ngifuna nje ukuba ngcono.
Yes, it will.	Kunjalo, kuzokwenzeka kanjalo.
He opened one.	Wavula eyodwa.
I like being outside.	Ngithanda ukuba ngaphandle.
So far this is exactly your way.	Kuze kube manje lena indlela yakho impela.
It has to be something else.	Kufanele kube okunye.
So maybe you should tell me what happened.	Ngakho mhlawumbe kufanele ungitshele ukuthi kwenzekeni.
But he was too scared to cry.	Kodwa wayesaba kakhulu ukukhala.
Some days, we do the right thing.	Ngezinye izinsuku, senza into efanele.
We can't stay here, and we can't go.	Asikwazi ukuhlala lapha, futhi asikwazi ukuhamba.
You should be here next week.	Kufanele ube lapha ngesonto elizayo.
And you know me alone.	Futhi wazi mina ngedwa.
I couldn’t figure out how to do it.	Angikwazanga ukuthola ukuthi ngenze kanjani.
I have never been to a hospital.	Angikaze ngiye esibhedlela.
Maybe all of us now.	Mhlawumbe sonke manje.
So yes it is.	Ngakho yebo kunjalo.

It would be really nice.	Kungaba muhle ngempela.
And he would be, later.	Futhi wayezoba, kamuva.
What else .	Yini enye .
Every day, he returned to her.	Nsuku zonke, wabuyela kuye.
Not friends or family.	Hhayi abangani noma umndeni.
Everything happened badly here.	Konke kwenzeka kabi lapha.
He wanted something more, so he left.	Wayefuna okuthile okwengeziwe, ngakho wahamba.
This he said would be very difficult.	Lokhu uthe kuzoba nzima kakhulu.
He could not say how.	Akakwazanga ukusho ukuthi kanjani.
This is not your place right now.	Lena akuyona indawo yakho manje.
I had no idea about that.	Ngangingazi ngalokho.
Driving a job is not a problem.	Ukushayela umsebenzi akuyona inkinga.
But this sounds very true.	Kodwa lokhu kuzwakala kuyiqiniso kakhulu.
No one deserves this.	Akekho okufanele lokhu.
I can't think of it much.	Ngeke ngicabange ngakho kakhulu.

Little did I know that it would not be so.	Bengazi ukuthi ngeke kube njalo.
He asked to leave.	Wacela ukuhamba.
Well with him.	Kahle naye.
I know, it seems like a lot.	Ngiyazi, kubonakala sengathi kuningi.
And you know it isn't, not really.	Futhi uyazi ukuthi akuyena, hhayi ngempela.
I am not sure if this is possible.	Anginaso isiqiniseko sokuthi lokhu kungenzeka yini.
I will not do that.	ngeke ngenze njalo.
But you should never say that.	Kodwa akufanele neze usho lokhu.
Without me, it’s not much of a story.	Ngaphandle kwami, akuyona indaba eningi.
I do not like to buy too much.	Angithandi kakhulu ukuthenga.
Maybe he didn't go.	Mhlawumbe akazange ahambe.
It's not even a mistake.	Akulona ngisho iphutha.
There is no food outside.	Akukho ukudla ngaphandle.
More reason now.	Isizathu esengeziwe manje.
And he used to be very good.	Futhi wayevame ukuba kahle kakhulu.
He began to think.	Waqala ukucabanga.

I will not have to go to the office every day.	Ngeke kudingeke ngiye ehhovisi nsuku zonke.
I like it easily, just like you.	Ngithanda kalula, njengawe.
It is not always necessary.	Akudingekile ngaso sonke isikhathi.
He goes again.	Aphinde ahambe.
Certainly not in us.	Impela akekho kithi.
He did it his way.	Wenze ngendlela yakhe.
I just wanted to end the pain.	Bengifuna nje ukuqeda ubuhlungu.
Seeing my friends.	Ukubona abangani bami.

I once thought of something.	Ngike ngacabanga okuthile.
He can't do that, not now.	Angeke akwenze lokho, hhayi manje.
Clearly, he was not alone.	Ngokusobala, kwakungeyena yedwa.
But sometimes he did not do that.	Kodwa ngezinye izikhathi naye akazange akwenze lokho.
I can’t imagine why, but there is.	Angikwazi ukucabanga ukuthi kungani, kodwa kukhona.
We are having a wonderful time.	Senza isikhathi esihle kakhulu.
It's really hard now.	Kunzima impela manje.
He speaks the work.	Ukhuluma umsebenzi.
He used to stay in the house every night doing this.	Wayevame ukuhlala endlini njalo ebusuku enza lokhu.
This is my advice.	Lesi iseluleko sami.
It seems difficult to fix.	Kubonakala kunzima ukulungisa.
But he soon felt better.	Kodwa ngokushesha wazizwa engcono.
The way a dog does.	Indlela inja eyenza ngayo.
So everyone says.	Ngakho wonke umuntu uthi.
We both make mistakes.	Sobabili senza amaphutha.
We are not.	Asikho .
Let's build this project.	Ake sakhe lo msebenzi.
He did not speak to me for several years.	Akazange akhulume nami iminyaka embalwa.
And maybe he can.	Futhi mhlawumbe angaba.
Please stay here.	Ngicela uhlale lapha.
One friend cannot walk at all.	Omunye umngane akakwazi nhlobo ukuhamba.
I am always happy.	Ngijabule njalo.
Hopefully next year you will be much better.	Ngethemba ukuthi ngonyaka ozayo uzoba ngcono kakhulu.
It will not be you.	Ngeke kube nguwe.
Now please go.	Manje ngicela uhambe.
He will not.	Angeke .
I should have been suspicious, of course.	Bekufanele ngabe ngiyasola, kunjalo.
Obviously, it is difficult.	Ngokusobala, kunzima.
I live right here.	Ngihlala khona lapha.
Thank you so much everyone !.	Ngiyabonga kakhulu wonke umuntu!.
So you want a job.	Ngakho ufuna umsebenzi.
He will stay again.	Uzohlala futhi.
He has done so many times.	Wenze njalo kaningi.
He has never been seen.	Akakaze abonakale.
All or none.	Konke noma akukho.
He doesn't know what to do again.	Akazi ukuthi enzeni futhi.
Life is not one thing or another.	Ukuphila akuyona into eyodwa noma enye.
We know you exist.	Siyazi ukuthi ukhona.
It has to be in order for life to exist.	Kufanele kube ukuze ukuphila kube khona.
Or always closer.	Noma eduze njalo.
Help me with it.	Ngisize ngakho.
No one knows where it is.	Akekho owaziyo ukuthi kuphi.
I saw one.	Ngabona eyodwa.
We have a lot to do here together.	Kuningi okumele sikwenze lapha ndawonye.
One cannot do it yesterday or tomorrow.	Umuntu akakwazi ukwenza izolo noma kusasa.
I did not really want to be alone.	Ngangingafuni ngempela ukuba ngedwa.
She is very happy.	Ujabule impela.
My little one.	Ingane yami encane.
He probably shouldn’t even be here.	Cishe akufanele ngisho abe lapha.
This is not the answer.	Akuyona impendulo lena.
I wanted to be a mother.	Ngangifuna ukuba umama.
Yes, and that.	Yebo, nalokho.
That happened, too.	Lokho kwenzeka, futhi.
I really should have thought about that.	Bekufanele ngempela ngicabange ngalokho.
So it is again.	Kunjalo futhi futhi.
I had to go, too.	Kwadingeka ngihambe, nami.
But this would be a lie.	Kodwa lokhu kungaba amanga.
It's just not there.	Akukho nje.
That is not my fault.	Lokho akulona iphutha lami.
Or, not too bad.	Noma, hhayi okubi kakhulu.
And she is very beautiful, too.	Futhi muhle kakhulu, futhi.
But something happened there.	Kodwa kukhona okwenzekayo lapho.
We really have to do something.	Empeleni kufanele senze okuthile.
You are the best of us, you know that.	Ungcono kakhulu wethu, uyakwazi lokho.
It happened just before.	Kwenzeka kanye ngaphambili.
And now there is this.	Futhi manje kukhona lokhu.
Because of you, the way you do.	Ngenxa yakho, indlela owenza ngayo.
But it really is very difficult to do.	Kodwa ngempela kunzima kakhulu ukukwenza.
In fact,.	Empeleni, .
Speaking speak.	Ukukhuluma ukukhuluma.
But he could not do it alone.	Kodwa akakwazanga ukukwenza yedwa.
For me that.	Ngami lokho.
We found a picture of her.	Sithole isithombe sakhe.
You will do almost the same thing every day.	Uzokwenza cishe into efanayo nsuku zonke.
He always left.	Ngaso sonke isikhathi wahamba.
Maybe a few hours is okay.	Mhlawumbe amahora ambalwa kulungile.
Definitely but.	Nakanjani kodwa.
Everyone hurts so much about you.	Wonke umuntu ubuhlungu kanjalo ngawe.
I love when that happens.	Ngithanda uma lokho kwenzeka.
I mean that's right.	Ngisho ukuthi kunjalo.
I have no questions.	Anginayo imibuzo.
Why is he not in prison ?.	Kungani engekho ejele?.
He wanted to help, and he did.	Wayefuna ukusiza, wakwenza ngempela.
But he could never do it.	Kodwa akakwazanga neze ukukwenza.
Hopefully, you are.	Ngethemba, ukhona.
And that's a slow thing, too.	Futhi leyo yinto ehamba kancane, futhi.
Here it is not really something or anyone.	Lapha akuyona into ngempela noma othile.
But he too is not able to sleep.	Kodwa naye akakwazi ukulala.
Location does not exist.	Indawo ayikho.
This is my car.	Imoto yami le.
Sounds like this might be the case.	Kuzwakala njengoba lokhu kungase kube njalo.
My doctor says there is nothing wrong with me.	Udokotela wami uthi akukho okubi ngami.
Just sleep.	Ukulala nje.
And yet, he did not know it.	Futhi noma kunjalo, wayengazi ukuthi ukhona.
He is a much better person than I am.	Ungumuntu ongcono kakhulu kunami.
Not sure, but it is possible.	Akusona isiqiniseko, kodwa kungenzeka.
I think yes and no.	Ngicabanga ukuthi yebo futhi cha.
Only family thinks for a long time.	Umndeni kuphela ocabanga ngesikhathi eside.
That soon.	Lokho maduze nje.
It has been very good for him.	Kube kuhle kakhulu kuye.
My point is here.	Umqondo wami ulapha.
Not me, not someone else.	Hhayi mina, hhayi omunye umuntu.
You want your place.	Ufuna indawo yakho.
But he left.	Kodwa wahamba.
I really came hard.	Ngempela ngize kanzima.
No one has done any work on this, except me.	Akekho owenze umsebenzi kulokhu, ngaphandle kwami.
He knows exactly what he means.	Wazi kahle ukuthi usho ukuthini.
Certainly he is.	Impela nguye.
There he wants to know.	Kukhona afuna ukwazi.
It will take a long time to repair.	Kuzothatha isikhathi eside ukulungisa.
Finally !.	Ekugcineni!.
He lives in prison.	Uhlala ejele.
My mother must have known.	Kumelwe ukuba umama wayazi.
First, it is not true.	Okokuqala, akulona iqiniso.
Soon, that's right.	Ngokushesha, kunjalo.
I did it again.	Ngikwenze futhi.
I walked slowly towards her.	Ngihambe kancane ngiye kuye.
But now there is more, more.	Kodwa manje kuningi, okuningi kakhulu.
Yes, yes, another story indeed.	Yebo, yebo, enye indaba ngempela.
But it seemed worth it.	Kodwa kubonakala kwakufanele.
Now for you.	Manje ngawe.
I think you should go.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kufanele uhambe.
So sleep.	Ngakho ukulala.
I had to sit down.	Kwadingeka ngihlale phansi.
Lots of people, lots of people.	Abantu abaningi, abaningi.
I tried to quit before.	Ngazama ukuyeka ngaphambili.
He used to stay for hours.	Wayevame ukuhlala amahora wonke.
And no matter how hard I try to be beautiful.	Futhi noma ngabe ngizama ukuba muhle kangakanani.
You can't expect any more.	Ngeke ulindele okunye okwengeziwe.
He is trying to say something.	Uzama ukusho okuthile.
There was.	Kade kukhona.
Maybe it's really hard to know.	Mhlawumbe kunzima ngempela ukwazi.
He has no other name and no other life.	Akanalo elinye igama futhi akanayo enye impilo.
It happened a few times.	Kwenzeka izikhathi ezimbalwa.
It will be difficult for you.	Kuzoba nzima kuwe.
He didn't talk much about it.	Akazange akhulume kakhulu ngalokho.
Most of the time, you do not need to do this.	Isikhathi esiningi, awudingi ukwenza lokhu.
Or at least he hoped it would be a doctor.	Noma okungenani wayenethemba lokuthi kuzoba udokotela.
Obviously, not every day.	Ngokusobala, hhayi zonke izinsuku usuku lonke.
That's what everybody ever did.	Yilokho wonke umuntu ake akwenza.
In fact, you may find more.	Empeleni, kungenzeka uthole okwengeziwe.
I wish you were better.	Ngifisa sengathi ngabe ungcono.
But again, he probably did.	Kodwa futhi, mhlawumbe wakwenza.
It did not help me.	Akuzange kube usizo kimi.
I always think about it.	Ngihlale ngicabanga ngakho.
Sometimes quickly, sometimes not immediately.	Ngezinye izikhathi ngokushesha, ngezinye izikhathi hhayi ngokushesha.
In this he is.	Kulokhu nguye.
The problem here.	Inkinga lapha.
He will do anything to fix things.	Uzokwenza noma yini ukulungisa izinto.
He refused to eat.	Wenqaba ukudla.
Maybe not all, but most of you.	Mhlawumbe hhayi konke, kodwa okuningi kwakho.
There is a very serious danger.	Kukhona ingozi enkulu kakhulu.
Not so with you or anyone else.	Akunjalo wena noma omunye umuntu.
No, he said, it had to be him.	Cha, wathi, kwakufanele kube nguyena.
You feel happy.	Uzizwa ujabule.
Maybe it is not necessary now.	Mhlawumbe akudingekile manje.
It seems to be the case here.	Kubonakala sengathi kunjalo lapha.
Isn't it ?.	Akunjalo?.
I will go with you tomorrow.	Ngizohamba nawe kusasa.
He is talking to us.	Ukhuluma nathi.
How long .	Isikhathi eside kangakanani .
One never knows.	Umuntu akakaze azi.
A whole new life for me.	Impilo entsha ngokuphelele kimi.
It does not mean that it will be for you.	Akusho ukuthi kuzoba kuwe.
That is not the only problem.	Akuyona inkinga kuphela leyo.
He did not go home.	Akazange aye ekhaya.
That should happen now.	Lokho kufanele kwenzeke manje.
This way you like.	Ngale ndlela uthanda.
And that's what he is.	Futhi yilokho ayikho.
And he got the answer.	Futhi wathola impendulo.
He didn't really want to drive anywhere.	Wayengafuni ngempela ukushayela noma kuphi.
He would love to.	Angathanda kakhulu.
Not that good.	Hhayi ukuthi kuhle.
Not a big name.	Akulona igama elikhulu.
I don’t want it to be too late in class.	Angifuni ukuba sekwephuzile kakhulu ekilasini.
He was thinking of other things.	Wayecabanga ezinye izinto.
But he wouldn't want me to do that.	Kodwa wayengeke afune ngenze lokho.
No, you can't log in.	Cha, awukwazi ukungena.
I mean nothing.	Ngisho lutho.
I do not want to be.	angifuni ukuba.
He knew he could do this.	Wayazi ukuthi angakwenza lokhu.
What is happening now ?.	Kwenzakalani manje?.
And you will be wrong.	Futhi uzobe unephutha.
Doing the first test.	Ukwenza ukuhlolwa okokuqala.
He thought about all this.	Wacabanga konke lokhu.
Most of the time, though.	Isikhathi esiningi, noma kunjalo.
My parents .	Abazali bami .
I just didn't want to hear.	Ngangingafuni nje ukuzwa.
He doesn't even have to say anything at the moment.	Akudingeki nokuthi asho lutho ngalesi sikhathi.
Lately I have not been so happy.	Muva nje angizange ngijabule kangako.
But water is water.	Kodwa amanzi amanzi.
It could be someone else.	Kungaba omunye umuntu.
Work or activity.	Umsebenzi noma umsebenzi.
He has been with us all the way.	Ube nathi indlela yonke.
But, this is not always the case.	Kodwa, lokhu akunjalo ngaso sonke isikhathi.
He said he would come, anyway.	Wathi uzofika, noma kunjalo.
Great house.	Indlu enkulu.
She loves being with him.	Uthanda ukuba naye.
Even a few hours.	Ngisho amahora ambalwa.
If you can do it there, fine.	Uma ungakwenza lapho, kuhle.
He will be gone all day.	Uzobe engekho usuku lonke.
It could have been in high school.	Kungenzeka esikoleni esiphakeme.
You must have made a fuss.	Kumelwe ukuba wenze umsindo.
He did a great job with it.	Wenza umsebenzi omkhulu ngayo.
He had to sit down.	Kwadingeka ahlale phansi.
He knew some things.	Wayazi ezinye izinto.
Me, not him.	Mina, hhayi yena.
I don't think he is.	Angicabangi ukuthi ubani.
I think he is very talented.	Ngicabanga ukuthi unekhono kakhulu.
He knew he was coming.	Wayazi ukuthi uyeza.
And a little pain to do.	Futhi kancane ubuhlungu ukwenza.
I never really knew, until now.	Angikaze ngikwazi ngempela, kuze kube manje.
You want this.	Ufuna lokhu.
There has to be.	Kuzofanele kube khona.
To the place.	Ukuya endaweni.
I told my girlfriend.	Ngatshela intombi yami.
At least he thought about it.	Okungenani wayecabanga ngakho.
It is not our best idea.	Akuwona umbono wethu omuhle.
We do a good job.	Senza umsebenzi omuhle.
But that will take a lot of time.	Kodwa lokho kuzothatha isikhathi esiningi kakhulu.
But that is not the case here.	Kodwa akukho lokho lapha.
Is that possible ??.	Kungenzeka lokho??.
I was not happy about that either.	Nami angizange ngijabule ngakho.
He probably knew.	Kungenzeka ukuthi wayazi .
I didn’t do it on time.	Angizange ngikwenze ngesikhathi.
Hard work.	Ukusebenza kanzima kanzima.
This job, you know.	Lo msebenzi, uyazi.
Not him, it.	Hhayi yena, yona.
This is our life !.	Impilo yethu le!.
Good to work with you.	Kuhle ukusebenza nawe.
Just an opportunity.	Ithuba nje.
I can't wait that long.	Angikwazi ukulinda isikhathi eside kangako.
Sometimes we do things right and sometimes we make mistakes.	Ngezinye izikhathi senza izinto kahle futhi ngezinye izikhathi senza amaphutha.
He said no, it is not.	Wathi cha, akunjalo.
Hopefully it will happen soon.	Ngethemba ukuthi kuzokwenzeka maduze nje.
So last year you went very fast.	Ngakho ngonyaka odlule uhambe ngokushesha okukhulu.
In the meantime, we are doing well.	Okwamanje, senza kahle.
No need at all.	Asikho isidingo nhlobo.
But still, he could not walk.	Kodwa noma kunjalo, akakwazanga ukuhamba.
But that should not be the case.	Kodwa lokho akumele kube njalo.
Being alone is good.	Ukuba wedwa kuhle.
And how wonderful it is to tell the truth.	Futhi yeka ukuthi kuhle kanjani ukukhuluma iqiniso.
You do not need any more photos.	Awudingi ezinye izithombe.
I make my own pictures.	Ngenza izithombe zami.
Let me go to her.	Ngivumele ngiye kuye.
It shouldn’t be long now, hopefully.	Akufanele kube isikhathi eside manje, ngethemba.
Sometimes, that's just the way it is.	Ngezinye izikhathi, kunjalo nje.
And no later.	Futhi akukho ngemva.
I don't want to waste time.	Angifuni ukuchitha isikhathi.

The more, the better.	Okuningi, kungcono.
He wanted, now.	Wayefuna, manje.
When you think of something, it is true.	Uma ucabanga okuthile, kuyiqiniso.

Outside, maybe not.	Ngaphandle, mhlawumbe akunjalo.
Many of my friends.	Abangane bami abaningi.
Good to see you in the morning.	Kuhle ukukubona ekuseni.
I do not like to drink.	Angithandi ukuphuza.
I think almost everyone knows that.	Ngicabanga ukuthi cishe wonke umuntu uyakwazi lokho.
He didn't really want to get into all that.	Wayengafuni ngempela ukungena kukho konke lokho.
I have been hearing this for a long time.	Sekunesikhathi eside ngizwa lokhu.
And by doing so.	Futhi ngokwenza kanjalo.

I'm sorry again.	Ngiyaxolisa futhi.
A gift, indeed.	Isipho, ngempela.
It can be too much.	Kungaba kuningi kakhulu.
Not bad, you wouldn't say.	Hhayi kabi, ubungeke usho.

I did not want him to leave.	Ngangingafuni ahambe.
And me.	Futhi, mina.
But more is needed.	Kodwa kudingeka okwengeziwe kunalokho.
She is beautiful and beautiful at the same time.	Muhle futhi muhle ngesikhathi esisodwa.
Finding a job should be your career.	Ukuthola umsebenzi kufanele kube umsebenzi wakho.
We will not go long.	Ngeke sihambe isikhathi eside.
My problem is time.	Inkinga yami isikhathi.
He thought he knew, but he did not know who he was.	Wayecabanga ukuthi uyazi, kodwa wayengazi ukuthi ubani.
Maybe you did too.	Mhlawumbe nawe wakwenza.
So he was not.	Ngakho wayengekho.
I don't think we should go to work tomorrow.	Angicabangi ukuthi kufanele siye emsebenzini kusasa.
This is very good, he thought.	Lokhu kuhle kakhulu, wacabanga.
I didn't want a party.	Ngangingafuni iphathi.
There will be no mistake.	Ngeke kube khona iphutha.
He can't see it by that.	Akakwazi ukukubona ngalokho.
Because it's not true, you know.	Ngoba akulona iqiniso, uyazi.
It's just good once.	Kuhle kanye nje.
Something had to happen.	Kwakufanele kwenzeke okuthile.
Maybe there is something right now.	Mhlawumbe okwamanje kukhona okwamanje.
I wanted to get out of the car.	Ngangifuna ukuphuma emotweni.
To make it easier, so far.	Ukube lula, kuze kube manje.
So tell me about it.	Ngakho ngitshele ngakho.
But he did not say.	Kodwa akazange akusho.
That he cannot.	Ukuthi akakwazi.

I know you can do that.	Ngiyazi ungakwenza lokho.
But that happened, too.	Kodwa lokho kwenzeka, futhi.

In fact, all the work will do.	Empeleni, wonke umsebenzi uzokwenza.
Now he knew he had to do it.	Manje wayazi ukuthi kufanele akwenze.
First of all.	Okokuqala konke.
You know very well.	Uyazi kahle kakhulu.
And Dad had to go to his office.	Futhi ubaba kwadingeka aye ehhovisi lakhe.
That's all you have to do.	Yilokho kuphela okufanele ukwenze.
But it had to happen this way.	Kodwa kwakufanele kwenzeke ngale ndlela.
And some, too.	Futhi okunye, futhi.
Here he found great.	Lapha wathola okukhulu.
I like shopping.	Ngithanda ukuthenga.

Or someone else did.	Noma othile wenza.

And he will not be there for long.	Futhi ngeke abe lapho isikhathi eside.

He agreed to go.	Wavuma ukuya .
That a person feels the same way.	Ukuthi umuntu uzizwa ngendlela efanayo.
He wondered what was in between.	Wazibuza ukuthi yini phakathi.

Something terrible happened.	Kwenzeka into embi.
This is true for you.	Lokhu kuyiqiniso kuwe.
But he couldn't think of her now.	Kodwa akakwazanga ukucabanga ngaye manje.

I don't want to be like this.	Angithandi ukuba kanje.
No going home.	Akukho ukuya ekhaya.
This is true for me.	Lokhu kuyiqiniso kimi.
I can do that.	Ngingakwazi ukwenza lokho.
Now that doesn't seem to be the case.	Manje kubonakala sengathi lokho akunjalo ngokusobala.
Or how it happened.	Noma ukuthi kwenzeke kanjani.
I know very well how that sounds.	Ngiyazi kahle kakhulu ukuthi lokho kuzwakala kanjani.
Maybe just a big cat or maybe a dog.	Mhlawumbe nje ikati elikhulu noma mhlawumbe inja.
My mother opened that too.	Naye umama wavula lokho.
Until I heard.	Ngize ngizwe.
I need to work hard.	Ngidinga ukusebenza kanzima.
But not down.	Kodwa hhayi phansi.
This person is just a child.	Lo muntu uyingane nje.
It's not a good thing at all.	Akuyona into enhle neze.
It's up to him alone.	Kuye yedwa.
He wanted to be here.	Wayefuna ukuba lapha.
He saw the flaws.	Wabona amaphutha.
It would be death.	Kungaba ukufa.
You think you will be a boy.	Ucabanga ukuthi uzoba umfana.
But that is not the point.	Kodwa akuwona umqondo.
Last year it did not happen.	Ngonyaka odlule akuzange kwenzeke.
That's my team.	Iqembu lami lelo.
He said it had to be easy.	Wathi kwakudingeka kube lula.
Or you like it very much.	Noma uthanda kakhulu.
He should not go alone obviously.	Akumele ahambe yedwa kusobala.
He told me what he had done.	Wangitshela ukuthi wenzeni.
To the beginning.	Ukuze ekuqaleni.
Just fix things a little bit.	Ukulungisa nje izinto kancane.
I want and need your opinion.	Ngifuna futhi ngidinga umbono wakho.
He is doing much better this week.	Wenza kangcono kakhulu kuleli sonto.
I don't want to see you either.	Nami angifuni ukukubona.
We do the right thing.	Senza okufanele.
I hope it will be helpful.	Ngethemba ukuthi kuzoba usizo.
Definitely not at home.	Nakanjani akukho ekhaya.
And you plan your work.	Futhi uhlela umsebenzi wakho.
Maybe that's not true.	Mhlawumbe lokho akulona iqiniso.

Yes, he will.	Yebo, uzokwenza.
And that or your life.	Futhi lokho noma impilo yakho.
I can only drive one car.	Ngingakwazi ukushayela imoto eyodwa kuphela.
And, more often than not, it is here.	Futhi, kaningi kunalokho, kunjalo lapha.
I just don't want to get married.	Angifuni nje ukushada.
You can't be someone else.	Awukwazi ukuba omunye umuntu.
The rest is not.	Okunye akukho.
I want to go again.	Ngifuna ukuhamba futhi.
The wind is blowing so far.	Umoya uhamba kuze kube manje.
But this is not a mistake.	Kodwa lokhu akulona iphutha.
But that is the only place.	Kodwa indawo eyodwa kuphela leyo.
You can do it! 	Ungakwenza!
She looks very happy today.	Ubukeka ejabule kakhulu namuhla.
Pain, pain, pain.	Ubuhlungu, ubuhlungu, ubuhlungu.
Maybe tomorrow, maybe not.	Mhlawumbe kusasa, mhlawumbe ngeke.
It would be good for me.	Kungaba kuhle kimi.
But it happened yesterday.	Kodwa kwenzeke izolo.
This is not the same thing.	Lokhu akuyona into efanayo.
He knew what music was supposed to be.	Wayazi ukuthi umculo kwakufanele ube yini.
I have to think it will get better.	Kufanele ngicabange ukuthi kuzoba ngcono.
That is his problem.	Inkinga yakhe leyo.
You are trying to buy time.	Uzama ukuthenga isikhathi.
I like it hard.	Ngithanda kanzima.
I was so happy last night.	Ngijabule kakhulu izolo ebusuku.
You have to go through it.	Kuzomele uhambe ngakho.
If you have time, that's fine.	Uma unesikhathi, kuhle.
We need food.	Sidinga ukudla.
They eat again.	Aphinde adle.
Not really a waste of your time.	Hhayi ngempela ukuchitha isikhathi sakho.
Yes you feel bad.	Yebo uzizwa kabi.
That is why it all happened so quickly.	Yingakho konke kwenzeka ngokushesha.
Because it will be so.	Ngoba kuzoba njalo.
To make it easier.	Ukwenza kube lula.
He will be leaving soon.	Uzohamba maduze.
Many days now, she works alone.	Izinsuku eziningi manje, usebenza yedwa.
He wanted to know all about it.	Wayefuna ukwazi konke ngakho.
He arrived now.	Wafika manje.
It was not you.	Awuzange ube wena.
I found some things.	Ngithole ezinye izinto.
And, yes, he is.	Futhi, yebo, nguyena.
I thought for a long time about doing this.	Ngacabanga isikhathi eside kanzima ngokwenza lokhu.
No one in the world knows how you got here.	Akekho umuntu emhlabeni owaziyo ukuthi ufike kanjani lapha.
So he agreed.	Ngakho wavuma.
Everyone in the house knew about it.	Wonke umuntu wayazi ngakho endlini.
You know in advance.	Uyazi ngaphambili.
I have to wait.	Kufanele ngilinde.
He asked me in the middle.	Wangibuza phakathi.
There is no knowing what to do with him.	Akukho ukwazi ukuthi enzeni ngaye.
He lives in a house.	Uhlala endlini.
I like to talk a little.	Ngithanda ukukhuluma kancane.
I thought a little.	Ngicabange kancane.
He is not the one making the money.	Akuyena owenza imali.
Also, no waiting.	Futhi, akukho ukulinda.
In fact, it is not true.	Empeleni, akulona iqiniso.
No, nothing.	Cha, akukho lutho.
You should have said that.	Bekufanele usho njalo.
Not to play again.	Hhayi ukudlala futhi.
Thank you for leaving so soon.	Ngiyabonga ukuthi uhambe ngokushesha.
I think this is very difficult.	Ngicabanga ukuthi lokhu kunzima kakhulu.
I think we need help.	Ngicabanga ukuthi sidinga usizo.
He might be in that.	Angase abe kulokho.
I wonder who you are going with now.	Kazi uhamba nobani manje.
He asked permission to help.	Wacela imvume ukuze asize.
Not a really bad idea.	Akuwona umqondo omubi ngempela.
He is here and now.	Ukhona lapha futhi manje.
He would love your help.	Angathanda usizo lwakho.
She is my best child.	Uyingane yami engcono kakhulu.
It’s good to be with him, actually.	Kuhle ukuhlala naye, empeleni.
I can't walk fast.	Angikwazi ukuhamba ngokushesha.
This is really worth it.	Lokhu kufanele ngempela.
And this will definitely take time.	Futhi lokhu kuzothatha isikhathi nakanjani.
Or a window.	Noma iwindi.
Big, big problem.	Inkinga enkulu, enkulu.
And it is hard for me to fall asleep.	Futhi kunzima kimi ukulala.
Now she is scared.	Manje uyesaba.
Long wait.	Ukulinda isikhathi eside.
You can't keep talking like this.	Awukwazi ukuqhubeka ukhuluma kanje.
Okay about this place.	Kulungile ngale ndawo.
My best friend will do everything else.	Umngane wami omkhulu uzokwenza konke okunye.
You are probably here.	Cishe ulapha.
And not just a few things.	Futhi hhayi nje izinto ezimbalwa.
It is not a good idea to travel.	Akuwona umqondo omuhle ukuhamba.
Just stop for a moment.	Ukuyeka isikhashana nje.
You are the best of them all.	Ungcono ngakho konke.
If you do, good job.	Uma wenze, umsebenzi omuhle.
This is probably what happened.	Cishe kwenzeka kanje.
The problem is that in the end it is too long to wait.	Inkinga ukuthi ekugcineni isikhathi eside kakhulu ukulinda.
I'm sorry to hear that about him.	Ngiyaxolisa ukuzwa lokho ngaye.
I told you what to do.	Ngikutshele okufanele sikwenze.
Everything will be as it should be.	Konke kuzoba njengoba kufanele.
As done before.	Njengoba kwenziwe ngaphambilini.
He was just amazed.	Wavele wamangala.
This is right for me.	Lokhu kulungile kimi.
He will never say so.	Akasoze asho njalo.
You cannot do this alone.	Awukwazi ukwenza lokhu uwedwa.
I know why now.	Ngiyazi ukuthi kungani manje.
So, whatever it may be.	Ngakho, noma kungaba yini.
Learning to see what is happening.	Ukufunda ukubona okwenzekayo.
He did that only a few times.	Wakwenza lokho izikhathi ezimbalwa kuphela.
You try hard and you work hard.	Uzama kanzima futhi usebenza kanzima.
Living a lie.	Ukuphila amanga.
We know that is not true.	Siyazi ukuthi lokho akulona iqiniso.
It may also be helpful.	Kungase kube usizo futhi.
Who is that.	Ubani lowo.
So this.	Ngakho lokhu.
First of all, her dress is a real thing.	Okokuqala, ingubo yakhe yinto ngempela.
This is a bad thing.	Yinto embi le.
Not always though.	Hhayi njalo kodwa.
No, it would be helpful.	Cha, kungaba usizo.
He did not know what to do first.	Wayengazi ukuthi enzeni kuqala.
I just thought.	Ngicabange nje.
He would know nothing about it.	Wayengeke azi lutho ngakho.
I think you went there.	Ngicabanga ukuthi uye lapho.
Sometimes, you need a team.	Ngezinye izikhathi, udinga iqembu.
He was not really a friend.	Wayengeyena ngempela umngane.
He will not be alone, either.	Ngeke kube nguye yedwa, futhi.
He will never again be useful to us.	Ngeke aphinde abe usizo kithi.
He was not sure he could do that again.	Wayengenaso isiqiniseko sokuthi angakwenza lokho futhi.
I saw then.	Ngabona ngaleso sikhathi.
He thought he could do a good job with that.	Wayecabanga ukuthi angenza umsebenzi omuhle ngalokho.
Really nice, beautiful thing.	Into enhle ngempela, enhle.
He admitted this.	Wavuma lokhu.
There are no questions here.	Ayikho imibuzo lapha.
And maybe a lot more.	Futhi mhlawumbe okuningi okwengeziwe.
Or simply.	Noma kalula nje.
I'm waiting for an answer.	Ngilinde impendulo.
Since then, my view of the book has improved.	Kusukela ngaleso sikhathi, umbono wami ngale ncwadi uye waba ngcono.
Boy, of course.	Umfana, kunjalo.
But travel is not a problem.	Kodwa ukuhamba akuyona inkinga.
I'll have to wait until tomorrow.	Kuzomele ngilinde kuze kube kusasa.
He felt better than he had ever felt before.	Wazizwa engcono kunalokho ake wazizwa.
Still, that is what happened.	Noma kunjalo, yilokho okwenzeka.
I think he wants us to leave early.	Ngicabanga ukuthi ufuna sihambe kusenesikhathi.
Other remodeling would be great.	Okunye ukwenza kabusha kungaba kuhle.
And you are not.	Futhi awuyena.
He wanted his money.	Wayefuna imali yakhe.
Rather a test.	Kunalokho ukuhlolwa .
That must be him.	Kufanele kube nguye lowo.
Nothing so bad.	Akukho okubi kangako.
You have probably heard of him.	Cishe uke wezwa ngaye.
How he was not.	Wayengekho kanjani.
I want to do something great.	Ngifuna ukwenza into enkulu.
A lot is good too.	Okuningi kuhle futhi.
One should not do that.	Umuntu akufanele enze kanjalo.
And he did not say anything.	Futhi akazange asho lutho.
In your time.	Ngesikhathi sakho.
He walked over to her.	Wahamba waya kuye.
He should have stayed with her.	Bekufanele ahlale naye.
He did this, no, he did that.	Wenza lokhu, cha, wenza lokho.
And you don't have to play one anymore.	Futhi awudingi ukudlala eyodwa futhi.
And you're wrong about that, too.	Futhi unephutha ngalokho, futhi.
If so, how.	Uma kwenzeka, kwenzeka kanjani.
And you know it.	Futhi nawe uyazi.
He is not a good boy.	Akayena umfana omuhle.
He needs to learn to sleep alone.	Kudingeka afunde ukulala yedwa.
You have to tell me all the mistakes, all the mistakes.	Kufanele ungitshele wonke amaphutha, wonke amaphutha.
But today, we cannot speak.	Kodwa namuhla, asikwazi ukukhuluma.
But thank you very much.	Kodwa ngiyabonga kakhulu.
Maybe just kids.	Mhlawumbe izingane nje.
He is sitting at the table alone.	Uhlezi etafuleni yedwa.
I never had it, that's right.	Angikaze ngibe nakho, kunjalo.
But no, it will not be.	Kodwa cha, ngeke kube njalo.
That person did not exist.	Akazange abe khona lowo muntu.
He wanted it all.	Wayefuna konke.
Speaking, speaking, speaking.	Ukukhuluma, ukukhuluma, ukukhuluma.
Three hours down.	Amahora amathathu phansi.
Obviously, the family really is.	Ngokusobala, umndeni empeleni.
I have never told you everything before.	Angizange ngikutshele konke ngaphambili.
Even a boy.	Ngisho umfana.
But he did, always.	Kodwa wenza njalo, njalo.
I need to go back to the office.	Ngidinga ukubuyela ehhovisi.
It's not my fault at all.	Akulona iphutha lami nhlobo.
He did not want to help.	Wayengafuni ukusiza.
I can't talk about it.	Angikwazi ukukhuluma ngakho.
No one knows except you and me.	Akekho umuntu owaziyo ngaphandle kwami ​​nawe.
But it can also be very difficult.	Kodwa futhi kungase kube nzima kakhulu.
He could not finish.	Akakwazanga ukuqeda.
I've been looking for one, too.	Bengilokhu ngifuna eyodwa, futhi.
I do not want you to leave.	Angifuni uhambe.
But it will be a good time no matter what.	Kodwa kuzoba isikhathi esihle noma ngabe kwenzekani.
No, that will not be the case.	Cha, lokho angeke kube njalo.
We will have to make a decision soon.	Kuzomele senze isinqumo maduze.
It is very difficult to be a friend.	Kunzima kakhulu ukuba umngane.
It can be a big job.	Kungaba umsebenzi omkhulu.
He could not have imagined.	Ngabe akakwazanga ukucabanga.
Sometimes, that's right.	Ngezinye izikhathi, kunjalo.
No, today.	Cha, kusasa.
Really, I want to go.	Ngempela, ngifuna ukuhamba.
And he is happy about that.	Futhi ujabule ngalokho.
And he had to stay.	Futhi kwadingeka ahlale.
But I can no longer move on.	Kodwa angisakwazi ukuqhubeka.
He wanted time alone.	Wayefuna isikhathi eyedwa.
I don't have to do anything big about it.	Akumele ngenze into enkulu ngakho.
Maybe anytime.	Mhlawumbe noma nini.
He did not.	Akazange enze .
I can't wait to make one.	Angikwazi ukulinda ukwenza eyodwa.
I have to find a new one.	Kufanele ngithole entsha.
We too.	Nathi.
It could be in him.	Kungaba kuye.
There is food on the table.	Kukhona ukudla etafuleni.
He couldn't get into that at the time.	Wayengeke akwazi ukungena kulokho ngaleso sikhathi.
This is not in this case.	Lokhu akukho kulokhu.
He doesn't want to see you again.	Akafuni ukukubona futhi.
So much for it.	Kuningi ngakho.
He should not be here.	Akufanele abe lapha .
What a beautiful place though.	Yeka indawo enhle kodwa.
Right in the middle.	Khona phakathi.
He did not even know why.	Wayengazi nokuthi kungani.
You can do that, you know.	Ungakwenza lokho, uyazi.
Instead he picked up a book.	Kunalokho wathatha incwadi.
It is not a new concept.	Akuwona umqondo omusha.
That's much better.	Kungcono kakhulu lokho.
He is always happy to talk !.	Ujabule njalo ukukhuluma!.
So that's what happened.	Ngakho yilokho okwenzekayo.
Still.	Noma kunjalo .
Too hard working.	Ukusebenza kanzima kakhulu.
Currently a minor problem.	Njengamanje inkinga encane.
Everyone looks happy.	Wonke umuntu ubukeka ejabule.
And maybe not at all.	Futhi mhlawumbe akukho nhlobo.
All the money.	Yonke imali.
Maybe that person will never be there.	Mhlawumbe lowo muntu akasoze abe khona.
I did not really know how or why.	Ngangingazi ngempela ukuthi kanjani noma ngani.
But it doesn't matter now.	Kodwa akusho lutho manje.
I hope this is okay.	Ngethemba ukuthi lokhu kulungile.
It can be difficult to talk.	Kungaba nzima ukukhuluma.
Want to know my name? 	Uyafuna ukwazi igama lami?
But some reading is possible.	Kodwa okunye ukufunda kungenzeka.
This time he knew better.	Kulokhu wayazi kangcono.
But lunch is good.	Kodwa kuhle ukudla kwasemini.
And maybe that should be as it should be.	Futhi mhlawumbe lokho kufanele kube njengoba kufanele.
He started talking to her.	Waqala wakhuluma naye.
Nothing is happening here.	Akukho okwenzekayo lapha.
I don't know when that will be right now.	Angazi ukuthi lokho kuzoba nini okwamanje.

I know this is not true.	Ngiyazi ukuthi lokhu akulona iqiniso.
But it will not be so difficult.	Kodwa ngeke kube nzima kangako.
There is really no need to do that.	Empeleni asikho isidingo sokwenza lokho.

Either way, fine.	Noma iyiphi indlela, kuhle.

They say he's a good guy, but slowly.	Bathi ungumfana omuhle, kodwa kancane kancane.
You would not know it.	Ubungeke wazi ukuthi ukhona.
You know not.	Uyazi akunjalo.
And maybe you should too.	Futhi mhlawumbe nawe kufanele.
Well, he never went there himself.	Hhayi, akakaze aye lapho yena.
And not just a person.	Futhi hhayi nje umuntu.
But he decided to do it.	Kodwa wanquma ukwenza kanjalo.
He too looked young.	Naye wayebukeka esemncane.

He wanted nothing from her.	Wayengafuni lutho kuye.
Not that bad, is it ?.	Akuyona into embi kangako, akunjalo?.
Her father did not want to stay.	Ubaba wakhe wayengafuni ukuhlala.

And, really good.	Futhi, kuhle ngempela.
I think there is.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kukhona.
He gave a moment yes.	Wanikeza isikhashana yebo.
A nice little thing, too.	Into encane enhle, futhi.
I think that would be a good idea.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kungaba umqondo omuhle lowo.
I have to go at the end.	Kuzomele ngihambe ekugcineni.
And a friend to you.	Futhi umngane kuwe.
It could be me, yes.	Kungase kube yimi, yebo.
And time is not required.	Futhi isikhathi akudingeki.
I'm glad to be here with you.	Ngiyajabula ukuba lapha nami.
You are very wrong.	Unephutha kakhulu.
But he could not make that decision.	Kodwa akakwazanga ukwenza isinqumo.
And all of that is true.	Futhi konke lokho kuyiqiniso.
Maybe days.	Mhlawumbe izinsuku.
It does not matter if you know it or not.	Akusho lutho ukuthi uyazi noma cha.
Maybe this time, he thought.	Mhlawumbe kulokhu, wacabanga.
And it's good and everything.	Futhi kuhle futhi konke.
I just feel that way.	Ngizizwa kanjalo nje.
Day in time.	Usuku ngesikhathi.
Now all is well.	Manje konke kuhle.
Now is not the time or the place.	Manje akusona isikhathi noma indawo.
It is very difficult to pick someone right now.	Kunzima kakhulu ukukhetha umuntu njengamanje.
So you just keep thinking about what you did.	Ngakho uhlezi nje ucabanga ukuthi wenzeni.
You will need all that.	Uzodinga konke lokho.
He also did not speak.	Naye akazange akhulume.
I just like the picture.	Ngithanda nje isithombe.
I'm sure you told people this.	Ngiqinisekile ukuthi utshele abantu lokhu.
He rarely tries one method alone.	Akavamile ukuzama indlela eyodwa eyedwa.
This is my truth.	Lokhu kuyiqiniso lami.
I think you went too slow.	Ngicabanga ukuthi uhambe kancane kakhulu.
He started doing something else.	Waqala ukwenza okunye futhi.
I was thinking about you all the time.	Ngangicabanga ngawe ngaso sonke isikhathi.
He could not find the key right away.	Akakwazanga ukuthola ukhiye ngaso leso sikhathi.
I will not sit in the meeting.	Ngeke ngihlale emhlanganweni.
But you have to make a choice.	Kodwa kufanele wenze ukukhetha.
We all know that one of us is wrong.	Sonke siyazi ukuthi omunye wethu unephutha.
It should not be.	Akufanele kube.
Doing this is not a big deal.	Ngokwenza lokhu akuyona inkinga enkulu.
He told me he was not there.	Wangitshela ukuthi akekho.
He was alone.	Kade eyedwa.
He really can't help himself.	Ngempela akakwazi ukuzibamba.
He certainly was not a father.	Impela wayengeyena ubaba.
He sat down at his desk again.	Wahlala etafuleni lakhe futhi.
Thanks again.	Ngiyabonga futhi .
It does not matter how it happened.	Akusho lutho ukuthi kwenzeka kanjani.
I didn't really know.	Bengingazi ngempela.
You must be here now.	Kumele ngabe ulapha manje.
That's all you have to think about right now.	Yilokho kuphela okufanele ucabange ngakho manje.
Not that he knew why.	Hhayi ukuthi wayazi ukuthi kungani.
Every day .	Nsuku zonke .
He makes it very easy.	Wenza kube lula kakhulu.
I want to be a cat.	Ngifuna ukuba ikati.
He knew this was going to happen.	Wayazi ukuthi lokhu kuzokwenzeka.
He used to find his way.	Wayevame ukuthola indlela yakhe.
He has always seemed alone.	Ubelokhu ebonakala eyedwa.
It happened for many years.	Kwenzeka iminyaka eminingi.
My father did that.	Ubaba wakwenza lokho.
You can do it right here.	Ungakwenza khona lapha.
The doctor will not be long.	Udokotela ngeke abe mude.
So much for everything.	Kakhulu yonke into.
Almost soon.	Cishe maduze nje.
But, it will not.	Kodwa, ngeke.
I need you to stay there.	Ngidinga ukuthi uhlale lapho.
But you can't tell anyone that.	Kodwa ngeke utshele muntu lokho.
And what a great job that is!	Futhi yeka umsebenzi omkhulu lowo.
But something is happening here.	Kodwa kukhona okwenzekayo lapha.
His mother, that one.	Umama wakhe, lowo.
It should have been very difficult.	Bekufanele kube nzima kakhulu.
I think you should get help.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kufanele uthole usizo.
You are not yet.	Awuyena okwamanje.
To be high, it must be low.	Ukuze kube phezulu, kufanele kube phansi.
Me too, maybe.	Nami futhi, mhlawumbe.
But this time, everyone came in.	Kodwa kulokhu, wonke umuntu wangena.
I was on my way to work.	Bengithi ngiya emsebenzini.
And he opened it.	Futhi wavula.
He stays here all the time.	Uhlale lapha sonke isikhathi.
But where there is a problem.	Kodwa lapho kukhona inkinga.
In this case, you will be wrong.	Kulokhu, uzobe unephutha.
But she is happy.	Kodwa ujabule.
He said he never said.	Wathi akakaze asho.
I want it right now.	Ngifuna okwamanje.
There you and I are.	Kukhona mina nawe.
I mean at least my mom is there.	Ngisho ukuthi okungenani umama wami ukhona.
I know what should happen.	Ngiyazi okufanele kwenzeke.
Lena.	Lena .
He did not think why.	Akazange acabange ukuthi kungani.
I have never done such a thing.	Angikaze ngiyenze into enjalo.
I just have to wait.	Kufanele ngilinde kuphela.
Actually doing things.	Empeleni ukwenza izinto.
So much for making a good impression.	Kakhulu ngokwenza umbono omuhle.
Nothing happens until it happens.	Akukho okwenzekayo kuze kwenzeke.
You should, too !.	Kufanele, futhi!.
I hope you will always come back.	Ngethemba ukuthi uzobuya njalo.
This should be done correctly.	Lokhu kufanele kwenziwe ngendlela efanele.
There had to be, of course.	Kwakufanele kube khona, kunjalo.
You probably knew.	Cishe wayazi.
He said he was happy to be my friend.	Wathi uyajabula ukuba umngane wami.
And it has to be you, no one else.	Futhi kufanele kube nguwe, akekho omunye.
Instead he left again.	Kunalokho wahamba futhi.
And almost at the top.	Futhi cishe phezulu.
In practice, it can be difficult.	Ngokwenza, kungaba nzima.
He will do better, he promised.	Uzokwenza kangcono, wathembisa.
How wrong you are.	Unephutha kanjani.
Time to think.	Isikhathi ucabange.
In his work, it was worth it.	Emsebenzini wakhe, kwakufanele.
Well done .	Wenze kahle .
It must be a boy.	Kumele kube umfana.
He was not there every day.	Wayengekho nsuku zonke.
Man lives alone.	Umuntu uhlala yedwa.
I want to make a good impression first.	Ngifuna ukwenza umbono omuhle kuqala.
I wanted a girlfriend.	Ngangifuna intombi.
My father too.	Ubaba naye.
I am a mother now.	Yimina umama manje.
I never thought to talk about it.	Angikaze ngicabange ukukhuluma ngakho.
He came to a large house.	Afike endlini enkulu.
But still there is danger.	Kodwa noma kunjalo kukhona ingozi.
Very nice person, to go like that.	Umuntu omuhle kakhulu, ukuhamba kanjalo.
He came home.	Afike ekhaya.
There must be help.	Kufanele kube khona usizo.
Neither have I.	Nami angikaze ngibe nakho.
But he never told me why.	Kodwa akazange angitshele ukuthi kungani.
You talk about this all the time.	Ukhuluma ngalokhu ngaso sonke isikhathi.
Still, he will.	Noma kunjalo, uzokwenza.
But, more on that, later.	Kodwa, okuningi ngalokho, kamuva.
I really want to do it.	Ngifuna ngempela ukukwenza.
This will be good for me.	Lokhu kuzoba kuhle kimi.
No, not at all.	Cha, hhayi yedwa.
I can't say that enough.	Angikwazi ukusho lokho ngokwanele.
I did not find a way.	Angizange ngithole indlela.
Just after we were.	Ngemva nje kokuba sibe .
Not too hard.	Hhayi kanzima kakhulu.
But he did not have to.	Kodwa kwakungadingeki ukuba enze lokho.
Nowhere do we need it.	Akukho lapho sidinga khona.
I still don't know anything about him.	Namanje angazi lutho ngaye.
I do not want anything from you.	angifuni lutho lwakho.
It is good to have it.	Kuhle ukuba nakho.
I want to do my best.	Ngifuna ukwenza konke okusemandleni.
I know you did this.	Ngiyazi ukuthi wenze lokhu.
I don't think very well yet.	Angicabangi kahle kakhulu okwamanje.

That's a good idea.	Icebo elihle lelo.
And he did a very good job.	Futhi wenza umsebenzi omuhle kakhulu.
Or do his best, at least.	Noma enze okusemandleni akhe, okungenani.
Not in the car.	Hhayi emotweni.
That, too, was worth it.	Lokho, futhi, bekufanele.
I want you to go there.	Ngifuna uye lapho.
Not your marriage.	Hhayi umshado wakho.
Not all of them are outstanding.	Angiyena wonke lowo ovelele.
You may need to think about it.	Kungase kudingeke ukuba ucabange ngakho.
He would not be your friend for long.	Wayengeke abe umngane wakho isikhathi eside.
I really don't want to do anything right now.	Angifuni ngempela ukwenza lutho okwamanje.
Not at all like me.	Akunjalo neze njengami.
He retired a great deal.	Wathola umhlalaphansi omkhulu.
I'm just not sure if you look like him.	Angiqiniseki nje ukuthi ufana naye.
Because it is very difficult today.	Ngoba kunzima kakhulu namuhla.
He also did something.	Kukhona futhi akwenzile.
Yes, of course, that is possible.	Yebo, nakanjani, lokho kungenzeka.
Now tell me something.	Manje ngitshele okuthile.
He once had it all.	Wake waba nakho konke.
I actually thought.	Empeleni ngacabanga.
Not as it is today.	Hhayi njengoba kukhona namuhla.
We had to do something.	Kwakufanele senze okuthile.
And not immediately.	Futhi hhayi ngokushesha futhi.
Now it's not over.	Manje akukho phezulu.
And did you know.	Futhi ngabe uyazi.
At first he didn't have my time.	Ekuqaleni wayengenaso isikhathi sami.
You eat food.	Udla ukudla.
In the same way, it is true.	Ngendlela efanayo, kuyiqiniso.
I'm glad we don't have to.	Ngiyajabula ukuthi akudingeki sikwenze.
I would just like to talk about that.	Ngingathanda ukukhuluma ngalokho kuphela.
I had to do this alone.	Kwadingeka ngikwenze lokhu ngedwa.
You, too.	Nawe, naye.
He seemed very happy to hear this.	Wabonakala ejabule kakhulu ukuzwa lokhu.
Every day for a long time.	Nsuku zonke isikhathi eside.
Nice place though.	Indawo enhle kodwa.
He refused to buy anything else.	Wenqaba ukuthenga noma yini enye.
Everything, all food, all the time.	Konke, konke ukudla, ngaso sonke isikhathi.
And there is no single correct answer.	Futhi ayikho impendulo eyodwa efanele ngempela.
Happy alone.	Ejabule yedwa.
So, very close.	Ngakho, eduze kakhulu.
Please, make this easy.	Ngicela, wenze lokhu kube lula.
You don't have to think about that.	Akumele ucabange ngalokho.
Not every day, but always.	Hhayi nsuku zonke, kodwa njalo njalo.
I need a gun.	Ngidinga isibhamu.
Just great for his age.	Enkulu nje ngeminyaka yakhe.
Not waiting for something else.	Hhayi ukulinda enye into.
I said almost.	Ngathi cishe.
Not quite right.	Hhayi kahle kahle.
He is not here, but.	Akekho lapha, kodwa .
You want to think about it as little as possible.	Ufuna ukucabanga ngakho kancane ngangokunokwenzeka.

Hopefully next week.	Ngethemba ngesonto elizayo.
That's what the boy did.	Wakwenza lokho umfana.
Great response.	Impendulo kakhulu.
But something.	Kodwa into .
There are pictures, even.	Kukhona izithombe, ngisho.
Anything to simplify it.	Noma yini ukwenza lula ngakho.
And they say it often enough.	Futhi bathi kaningi ngokwanele.
And he knew what he looked like.	Futhi wayazi ukuthi wayebukeka kanjani.
Now it's good.	Manje kuhle.
So you need to choose that.	Ngakho udinga ukukhetha lokho.
It would be a very good job.	Kungaba umsebenzi omuhle kakhulu.
But he too was afraid.	Kodwa naye wayesaba.
He probably did not know about this.	Cishe wayengazi ngalokhu.
Not too much, not too little.	Hhayi kakhulu, hhayi kancane kakhulu.
I will definitely do it again and again.	Ngizokwenza nakanjani futhi futhi futhi.
But apparently someone found a way to do this.	Kodwa ngokusobala othile uthole indlela yokwenza lokhu.
I don’t really know what else I should do.	Angikwazi ngempela ukuthi yini enye okufanele ngiyenze.
I wanted to know when he would return.	Bengifuna ukwazi ukuthi uzobuya nini.
Please tell me when and where.	Ake ungitshele ukuthi nini futhi kuphi.
He did not want to come out to us.	Wayengafuni ukuphuma eze kithi.
You know.	Nawe uyazi.
I can't do it.	Angeke ngikwazi ukukwenza.
You will need one.	Uzodinga eyodwa.
You can't even do that, you can't take a picture.	Awukwazi ngisho ukwenza lokho, awukwazi ukuthatha isithombe.
To think, that.	Ukucabanga, lokho.
You are not visible to me.	Awubonakali nami.
We should have done a lot more.	Kufanele ngabe senza okuningi okwengeziwe.
I know that is my answer.	Ngiyazi impendulo yami leyo.
You will not be able to see anything else.	Ngeke ukwazi ukubona okunye.
And soon it will not be.	Futhi maduze ngeke kube .
I know this one died.	Ngiyazi ukuthi lo omunye washona.
I do not have enough time.	Anginaso isikhathi esanele.
Not too bad.	Hhayi kabi kakhulu.
I did not want to wait until tomorrow.	Ngangingafuni ukulinda kuze kube kusasa.
Death must be good.	Ukufa kumele kube kuhle.
I'm afraid to tell you.	Ngesaba ukukutshela.
That should be me.	Kumele kube yimi lowo.
But for now, no.	Kodwa okwamanje, cha.

You can see what a child is.	Uyakwazi ukubona ukuthi yini ingane.
He does the job once and for all.	Wenza umsebenzi kanye.
Curious, he easily opened the door.	Efuna ukwazi, wavula umnyango kalula.
And this happens all the time.	Futhi lokhu kwenzeka njalo.
Why, everybody knows what you did.	Ngani, wonke umuntu uyazi ukuthi wenzeni.
But it was worth it.	Kodwa bekufanele.
I asked everywhere for help.	Ngacela yonke indawo usizo.
At the moment, there is no particular choice.	Okwamanje, akukho ukukhetha okuthile.
You just need time alone.	Udinga nje isikhathi uwedwa.

How do you know? 	Wazi kanjani?
Is that it.	Ngabe lokho .
But this is good enough.	Kodwa lokhu kuhle ngokwanele.

I need to try some.	Ngidinga ukuzama ezinye.
I want to be better.	Ngifuna ukuba ngcono.
But he could not get inside him.	Kodwa akakwazanga ukungena kuye.
What’s worse now, of course.	Okubi manje, kunjalo.
It does not mean that you have made money.	Akusho ukuthi wenze imali.
But up.	Kodwa phezulu.
No one knows yet.	Akekho owaziyo okwamanje.
Probably a lifelong friend.	Mhlawumbe umngane ukuphila kwakho konke.
I know it is very difficult.	Ngiyazi ukuthi kunzima kakhulu.
He should be a good doctor.	Kufanele abe udokotela okahle.
That is not the case at all.	Akukhona lokho nhlobo lokhu.
It may be the worst thing yet.	Kungase kube yinto embi kakhulu okwamanje.
And apparently not.	Futhi ngokusobala akunjalo.
There is something.	Kukhona okuthile .

He could not contain himself.	Akakwazanga ukuzibamba lokho.
You told me how I did this.	Ungitshele ukuthi ngikwenze kanjani lokhu.
He said he never did.	Wathi akakaze.
So yes that's exactly it.	Ngakho yebo yilokho ngempela.
He finally made the decision.	Ekugcineni wathatha isinqumo.
And next year.	Futhi ngonyaka ozayo.
Instead we do something.	Kunalokho senza okuthile.
Still it seems to us.	Noma kunjalo kubonakala ngathi.

I wanted to come.	Bengifuna ukuza.
They are not mistakes.	Akuwona amaphutha.

You will go alone.	Uzohamba wedwa.

But he keeps talking all day long.	Kodwa uhlezi ekhuluma usuku lonke.
To make you better.	Ukwenza ube ngcono.
I don't think so.	Angiboni kunjalo.
Or it is not really true.	Noma akulona iqiniso ngempela.
Probably the best time ever.	Mhlawumbe isikhathi esihle kakhulu.
She felt that she was feeling better.	Wezwa ukuthi uzizwa kahle.

Or try at least.	Noma uzama okungenani.
He did not drive.	Akazange ashayele.
Your place to do it, of course.	Indawo yakho yokwenza, kunjalo.
There is nothing that any of us can do.	Akukho lutho noma ubani wethu angakwenza.
So the teacher would never make a mistake.	Ngakho, uthisha akasoze enze iphutha.
I would not, at least.	Bengingeke, okungenani.
You will go to your bed.	Uzohamba embhedeni wakho.
Now to find out.	Manje ukuthola.
You never thought about it, even.	Awuzange ucabange ngakho, ngisho.
There it is.	Nakho lapho.

He must not do that.	Akumele akwenze lokho.
Just saying.	Ukusho nje.
He wanted to be better.	Wayefuna ukuba ngcono.
He was not in the house at all.	Wayengekho nhlobo endlini.
The problem is not with us.	Inkinga ayikho kithi.
I go outside.	Ngiya ngaphandle.
I can't wait to stay again.	Angisakwazi ukulinda ukuhlala futhi.
So obviously that is possible.	Ngakho ngokusobala lokho kungenzeka.
Neither did you.	Nawe awuzange.
But yes with everything else.	Kodwa yebo ngakho konke okunye.
That would only be good.	Lokho kungaba kuhle kuphela.
It should be very nice to see.	Kumele kube kuhle kakhulu ukubona.
Another coffee.	Elinye ikhofi.

You want to learn the truth.	Ufuna ukufunda iqiniso.
Waiting for nothing.	Ukulinda lutho.

You can't figure out what the problem is.	Awukwazi ukuthola ukuthi yini inkinga.
Not as many, it is.	Hhayi njengoba abaningi, kunjalo.
He said it was a very bad idea.	Uthe umbono omubi kakhulu lowo.

For ease of reading.	Ukuze kube lula ukufunda.
Or a year from now.	Noma ngonyaka kusukela manje.
I think that's fine now.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kuhle manje.
And hopefully.	Futhi ngethemba.
Clearly, he is very determined.	Ngokusobala, uzimisele kakhulu.
Up in my house.	Phezulu endlini yami.
Not because of him.	Hhayi ngenxa yakhe.
It will happen and it will happen.	Kuzokwenzeka futhi kwenzeke.
As you did before.	Njengoba wenza ngaphambili.
I really wish he could do that.	Ngifisa ngempela ukuthi angenza njalo.
But we must do it right.	Kodwa kufanele sikwenze ngendlela efanele.
He should not speak at all.	Akumele akhulume nhlobo.
But a little later than that.	Kodwa kancane kancane kunalokho.
You eat alone.	Udla wedwa.
He asked me questions.	Wangibuza imibuzo.
He told me how I got there.	Wangitshela ukuthi ngifike kanjani lapho.
You want power.	Ufuna amandla.
My father did not know what to do.	Ubaba wayengazi ukuthi enzeni.
And I did not.	Futhi angizange.
No, soon anything.	Akunjalo, maduze noma yini.
Not quite an idea.	Hhayi impela umbono.
I will do it one way or another.	Ngizokwenza ngendlela eyodwa noma enye.
You can't go to work.	Awukwazi ukuya emsebenzini.
This is not true here.	Lokhu akulona iqiniso lapha.
A few days, at least.	Izinsuku ezimbalwa, okungenani.
He has been coming home in the summer before.	Ubelokhu efika ekhaya ehlobo ngaphambili.
I need to talk to you, immediately.	Ngidinga ukukhuluma nawe, ngokushesha.
He looked at many pictures.	Wabheka izithombe eziningi.
He has just started college.	Usanda kuqala ekolishi.
It was supposed to be tonight.	Bekufanele kube namhlanje ebusuku.
I just want to find out what happened.	Ngifuna nje ukuthola ukuthi kwenzekeni.
We will not be that.	Ngeke sibe yilokho.
It is good to be with you.	Kuhle ukuhlala nawe.
Probably nothing happens.	Mhlawumbe akukho okwenzekayo.
Everyone wanted one.	Wonke umuntu wayefuna eyodwa.
And he did, yes.	Futhi wakwenza, yebo.
Instead he did.	Kunalokho wenza.
He took his coffee.	Wathatha ikhofi lakhe.
I know how to do that.	Ngiyazi ukwenza lokho.
Or the opportunity may be able to stay home.	Noma ithuba angakwazi ukuhlala ekhaya.
Finally he came to me.	Ekugcineni weza kimi.
I'm not sure what happened.	Angiqiniseki ukuthi kwenzekeni.
Maybe not for you.	Mhlawumbe ngeke kuwe.
But she seemed happy about it.	Kodwa wayebonakala ejabule ngakho.
Almost very good.	Cishe kahle kakhulu.
You obviously need.	Udinga ngokusobala.
That is, nothing else.	Yilokho, akukho okunye.
You will never know him.	Ngeke wazi naye.
And all is well.	Futhi konke kulungile.
There is no reason, there is no reason for all this.	Asikho isizathu, asikho isizathu sakho konke lokhu.
But he looked bad.	Kodwa wayebukeka kabi.
He says you can.	Uthi ungakwazi.
We will not do that in the city.	Ngeke sikwenze lokho edolobheni.
I didn't, really.	Angizange, ngempela.
At least a little every day.	Okungenani kancane nsuku zonke.
I think so, absolutely.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kunjalo, ngokuphelele.
It is difficult to pinpoint exactly why this happened.	Kunzima ukwazi kahle ukuthi kungani lokhu kwenzeka.
There is a question.	Kukhona umbuzo.
I just wanted to do that.	Bengifuna nje ukwenza lokho.
I can.	Ngingakwazi .
I wanted to think about it.	Ngangifuna ukucabanga ngakho.
But that sounds like it.	Kodwa kuzwakala sengathi kunjalo.
He may not be able to live alone.	Angase angakwazi ukuphila yedwa.
Talking about him.	Ukukhuluma ngaye .
I just wanted him to stop.	Bengifuna ayeke kuphela.
We didn’t really do much.	Asizange senze okuningi ngempela.
He would not want me to come.	Ubengeke afune ngize.
From now on, please stay here with me.	Kusukela manje, ngicela uhlale lapha nami.
Not just sometimes.	Hhayi nje ngezinye izikhathi.
If you can do it.	Uma ungakwenza.
And as long as you want.	Futhi isikhathi eside njengoba ufuna.
Her father agreed.	Ubaba wakhe wavuma.
And that he will never leave.	Nokuthi akasoze ahambe.
Certainly not.	Impela akuyena.
I need to prepare food.	Ngidinga ukulungisa ukudla.
I can't buy a dress.	Angikwazi ukuthenga ingubo.
Walking.	Ehamba .
If it happens for a long time.	Uma kwenzeka isikhathi eside.
This is not a job.	Lokhu akuwona umsebenzi.
He wants to be alone.	Ufuna ukuba yedwa.
Also, you know very well.	Futhi, ukwazi kahle kakhulu.
There is one more problem.	Kukhona enye inkinga eyodwa.
Thirty years ago.	Eminyakeni engamashumi amathathu edlule.
I will have plenty of time.	Ngizoba nesikhathi esiningi.
I do not see how.	Angiboni ukuthi kanjani.
I don't want to be alone right now.	Angifuni ukuba ngedwa njengamanje.
Not much about it.	Hhayi okuningi ngakho.
But he did it in the right way.	Kodwa wakwenza ngendlela efanele.
So the question remains.	Ngakho umbuzo uhlala.
If that's right.	Uma lokho kulungile.
He can't eat anything.	Akakwazi ukudla lutho.
I need my coffee.	Ngidinga ikhofi lami.
Outside, nothing happens.	Ngaphandle, akukho okwenzekayo.
He wouldn't want that.	Wayengeke afune lokho.
Soon something completely different.	Ngokushesha enye into ngokuphelele.
The more you travel, the better you feel.	Lapho uhamba kakhulu, uzizwa ungcono.
But everyone saw it.	Kodwa wonke umuntu wabona.
But he was a little scared for days.	Kodwa wesaba kancane izinsuku.
Likely you did too.	Cishe nawe wenza kanjalo.
He knew something, too.	Wayazi okuthile, futhi.
Stop crying now.	Yeka ukukhala manje.
Me? ' 	Mina?'
Not a word, not a phone call, not a letter.	Hhayi izwi, hhayi ucingo, hhayi incwadi.
My whole family attended.	Umndeni wami wonke waba khona.
I got my answer.	Ngithole impendulo yami.
No one does all this.	Akekho owenza konke lokhu.
There is a dress tonight.	Kukhona ingubo namhlanje ebusuku.
It all would have happened anyway.	Konke ngabe kwenzeka noma kunjalo.
I have to do that, too.	Kufanele ngenze lokho, futhi.
Or you.	Noma nawe.
And he is sleeping.	Futhi ulele.
The doctor needs more time.	Udokotela udinga isikhathi esengeziwe.
This may happen more often than you think.	Lokhu kungenzeka kaningi kunalokho ocabanga ngakho.
Let me say something about that.	Ake ngisho okuthile ngalokho.
That's fine, too.	Lokho kuhle, futhi.
Or his friend.	Noma umngane wakhe.
I wanted to make money.	Ngangifuna ukwenza imali.
But there is a boy.	Kodwa kukhona umfana.
We all make mistakes.	Sonke senza amaphutha.
not me.	hhayi mina.
We have made a lot of money.	Senze imali enkulu kakhulu.
Right.	Okufanele.
You think you are alone here in your room.	Ucabanga ukuthi uwedwa lapha ekamelweni lakho.
This is good advice.	Lesi iseluleko esihle.
He did it again.	Wakwenza kabusha.
More time with his friend.	Isikhathi esengeziwe umngane wakhe.
I just can't do that.	Angikwazi nje ukukwenza lokho.
You can too !.	Ungakwazi futhi!.
Okay, a lot.	Kulungile, okuningi.
And you know more.	Futhi uyazi okunye.
We have to find something.	Kufanele sithole okuthile.
But more on that a little bit.	Kodwa okuningi kulokho kancane.
He said it was difficult.	Wathi kunzima.
This may be your choice.	Lokhu kungaba ukukhetha kwakho.
Isn't that right.	Akuyona yini leyo.
I want to hear your voice.	Ngifuna ukuzwa izwi lakho.
None of us want to die.	Akekho kithi ofuna ukufa.
Not with us, but with me.	Hhayi nathi, kodwa nami nje.
But let me say this.	Kodwa ake ngisho lokhu.
I would not be like that here.	Angeke ngibe kanjalo lapha.
He went to prison for you.	Wangena ejele ngenxa yakho.
First, you need to select a location.	Okokuqala, udinga ukukhetha indawo.
I can, really.	Ngingakwazi, ngempela.
He never made a mistake.	Akazange enze iphutha.
He should stay with me.	Kufanele ahlale nami.
He will be there anytime now.	Uzoba khona noma nini manje.
But no sleep, no sleep.	Kodwa akukho ukulala, akukho ukulala.
I never did.	Angizange ngenze njalo.
Feeling healthy.	Ukuzwa impilo.
But it has always been there.	Kodwa kade kukhona njalo.
And no other food.	Futhi akukho okunye ukudla.
I'm sorry you feel that way.	Ngiyaxolisa ukuthi uzizwa kanjalo.
You really have had it.	Ube nakho ngempela.
Hopefully none of this is happening.	Ngethemba ukuthi akukho kulokhu okwenzekayo.
That's what it means.	Yilokho okushiwo.
I want to know more about it.	Ngifuna ukwazi okwengeziwe ngayo.
But also not the whole picture.	Kodwa futhi akusona sonke isithombe.
My family needs money.	Umndeni wami udinga imali.
It would be such a good thing.	Kungaba yinto enhle kangaka.
No problem for us.	Ayikho inkinga ngathi.
It's good to be there.	Kuhle ukuba lapho.
Before there were people, maybe.	Ngaphambi kokuba kube khona abantu, mhlawumbe.
In his absence, he did just that.	Njengoba engekho, ukwenzile lokho.
I wanted to be outside.	Ngangifuna ukuba ngaphandle.
I wanted to be a little alone.	Bengifuna ukuba ngedwa kancane.
I want to know, that's all.	Ngifisa ukwazi, yilokho kuphela.
That's a really good opportunity.	Ithuba elihle ngempela lelo.
I came here in the summer.	Ngize lapha ehlobo.
Yes, learning is hard.	Yebo, ukufunda kunzima.
But sometimes.	Kodwa ngezinye izikhathi .
He knew about it for weeks.	Wayazi ngakho amasonto.
But we both did what we needed to do.	Kodwa sobabili senza okwakudingeka sikwenze.
But this is by no means the time or place.	Kodwa lesi akusona neze leso sikhathi noma indawo.
He said that would be easy.	Wathi lokho kuzoba lula.
He will probably never come back.	Cishe ngeke aphinde abuye.
It will be a while, too.	Kuzoba isikhashana, futhi.
Now, he was afraid to go in the door.	Manje, wayesaba ukungena kwakhe emnyango.
Even my friends.	Ngisho abangani bami.
But this is clearly happening, too.	Kodwa lokhu kwenzeka ngokusobala, futhi.
He wouldn't be able to.	Ubengeke akwazi.
He heard.	Wezwa .
Our mother can't be there for you now.	Umama wethu akakwazi ukuba lapho ngenxa yakho manje.
But he could not see much.	Kodwa akakwazanga ukubona okuningi.
This is a completely different place.	Lena enye indawo ngokuphelele.
Marriage rearranges everything.	Umshado uhlela kabusha yonke into.
You know what's best for you.	Uyazi ukuthi yini engcono kuwe.
I don't want my family to know.	Angifuni umndeni wami wazi.
That doesn't mean at all.	Lokho akusho nhlobo.
I go where I sit, I always think.	Ngike ngiye lapho ngihlale, ngihlale ngicabange.
I think this will happen next year.	Ngicabanga ukuthi lokhu kuzokwenzeka ngonyaka ozayo.
Don't forget now.	Ungakhohlwa manje.
I never said anything.	Angikaze ngisho lutho.
Book to go home.	Incwadi eya ekhaya.
He got the idea.	Wathola umqondo.
Not immediately but.	Hhayi ngokushesha kodwa.
When it sounds right.	Lapho kuzwakala kulungile.
The problem, you say, is to tell the truth.	Inkinga, usho ukuthi, ukukhuluma iqiniso.
I wanted an answer.	Bengifuna impendulo.
You just did a good thing.	Wenze into enhle nje.
Good boy, he can't be good.	Umfana omuhle, ngeke abe muhle.
He walks slowly and active.	Uhamba kancane futhi usebenza.
Still, there are.	Noma kunjalo, kukhona.
He said no, he said yes.	Wathi cha, wathi yebo.
But he says this.	Kodwa usho lokhu.
He has to do something.	Kufanele enze okuthile.
Death can be wonderful.	Ukufa kungaba kuhle kakhulu.
It's hard sometimes.	Kunzima ngezinye izikhathi.
Or rather, it could be.	Noma kunalokho, kungaba.
And really, it didn’t go well.	Futhi ngempela, akuzange kube kahle.
Would you like some ?.	Ungathanda ezinye?.
And he soon knew.	Futhi ngokushesha wayazi.
You never want to be out.	Awufuni neze ukuba ngaphandle.
I had to make a place.	Bekufanele ngenze indawo.
But there are mistakes.	Kodwa kukhona amaphutha.
Not to get married.	Hhayi ukushada.
Great room.	Igumbi elikhulu.
In this case, almost.	Kulokhu, cishe.
Now you, please.	Manje wena, ngicela.
Not a bad idea, either.	Akuwona umqondo omubi, mhlawumbe.
Just my opinion though.	Umbono wami nje kodwa.
You seem to be unable to help.	Ubonakala ungakwazi ukukusiza.
He cannot continue like this.	Angeke akwazi ukuqhubeka kanje.
He went to college and did some work.	Waya ekolishi futhi wenza umsebenzi.
That's it, that's all.	Yilokho, yilokho konke.
It will be lunch.	Kuzoba ukudla kwasemini.
So, food to think about there.	Ngakho, ukudla ukucabanga lapho.
Also, it is good to know.	Futhi, kuhle ukwazi.
We know he did not.	Siyazi ukuthi akakwenzanga.
Yes, it is not, and no it is not.	Yebo, akunjalo, futhi cha akunjalo.
No, nothing really happens.	Cha, akukho okwenzekayo ngempela.
Soon you will be home.	Maduze uzofika endlini.
And coffee, of course.	Futhi ikhofi, kunjalo.
He did that to her.	Wakwenza lokho kuye.
He started to find out.	Waqala ukuthola.
Is there anyone else ?.	Ukhona omunye?.
He told me this.	Wangitshela lokhu.
In the meantime, we are doing everything right.	Okwamanje, senza konke kahle.
But now, he was not sure.	Kodwa manje, wayengenaso isiqiniseko.
He saw that something had to be done.	Wabona ukuthi kumele kwenziwe okuthile.
But sometimes you just have to do what you have to do.	Kodwa ngezinye izikhathi kufanele wenze lokho okufanele ukwenze.
You want something.	Ufuna okuthile.
You got my departure.	Uthole ukuhamba kwami.
Not everything, of course.	Akuyona yonke into, kunjalo.
He went in alone.	Wangena yedwa.
There was a noise.	Kube khona umsindo.
No choice at all.	Akukho ukukhetha nhlobo.
All right, that's fine.	Kulungile, lokho kuhle.
Not hard, but always.	Hhayi kanzima, kodwa ngaso sonke isikhathi.
He wanted something close.	Wayefuna okuthile eduze.
He knew there was no choice, really.	Wayazi ukuthi akukho ukukhetha, ngempela.
He did not want anyone around him.	Wayengafuni muntu eduze kwakhe.
I can no longer speak.	Angikwazi futhi ukukhuluma.
Okay, not really.	Kulungile, hhayi ngempela.
No time, no time, no time.	Asikho isikhathi, asikho isikhathi, asikho isikhathi.
Just to get the picture right.	Ukuze nje sithole isithombe ngendlela efanele.
He wants to be with his family.	Ufuna ukuba nomndeni wakhe.
This could be a mistake for him.	Lokhu kungaba iphutha kuye.
But you need help.	Kodwa udinga usizo.
Only me.	Mina kuphela .
You don't really need it.	Awudingi ngempela.
And now all this.	Futhi manje konke lokhu.
But we want to hear from you.	Kodwa sifuna ukuzwa kuwe.
I should have done something about it.	Kufanele ngabe ngenza okuthile ngakho.
I do not understand why.	Angiqondi ukuthi kungani .
He couldn't talk to her, yet.	Akakwazanga ukukhuluma naye, okwamanje.
But the case.	Kodwa icala.
You better think about this.	Kungcono ucabange ngalokhu.
And, obviously, it’s just not necessary.	Futhi, ngokusobala, asikho nje isidingo.
My father wanted to buy.	Ubaba wayefuna ukuthenga.
Because he can.	Ngoba angakwazi.
I wish it were but it is not.	Ngifisa kube njalo kodwa akunjalo.
People upstairs in the house.	Abantu phezulu endlini.
Looks like you've been there.	Kubonakala sengathi uke waba khona.
I want to work on that.	Ngifuna ukusebenza kulokho.
He just wants to play football.	Ufuna nje ukudlala ibhola.
He has no idea why we should go there.	Akazi nakancane ukuthi kungani kufanele siye lapho.
I look like that.	Ngibukeka kanjalo.
He did so to her.	Wenza kanjalo kuye.
I'm not sure what you did with this.	Angiqiniseki ukuthi wenzeni ngalokhu.
It was clear to me.	Kwacaca kimi.
I can't wait to get one !.	Angikwazi ukulinda ukuthola eyodwa!.
There seems to be something wrong here.	Kubonakala sengathi kukhona okubi lapha.
Let's do something.	Ake senze okuthile.
I need your feedback on this.	Ngidinga impendulo yakho kulokhu.
You will be very wrong.	Uzobe unephutha impela.
That's all he.	Konke lokho yena.
I'll be right there.	Ngizoba lapho impela.
Or at least not at all.	Noma okungenani hhayi konke.
And finally do it.	Futhi ekugcineni ukwenze.
He thought about it again.	Wacabanga ngakho futhi.
We make the best music.	Senza umculo ongcono kakhulu.
She's really nice and wants everyone to be her friend.	Muhle ngempela futhi ufuna wonke umuntu abe umngane wakhe.
Me too, right now.	Nami, njengamanje.
Epaki.	Epaki.
Yes, yes, whatever.	Yebo, yebo, noma yini.
There is no meat.	Ayikho inyama.
I should not have done that.	Kwakungafanele ngikwenze lokho.
And finally, yes.	Futhi ekugcineni, yebo.
He lives alone most of the time.	Uhlala eyedwa isikhathi esiningi.
And, that's exactly what happened.	Futhi, yilokho kanye okwenzeka.
And always, and so forth, and so forth.	Futhi njalo, njalo njalo, njalo njalo.
But at least you know about it.	Kodwa okungenani uyazi ngakho.
Shopping with family.	Ukuthenga nomndeni.
Everyone should drive these.	Wonke umuntu kufanele ashayele lezi.
And so on.	Futhi kanjalo.
Or for a long time.	Noma isikhathi eside.
I could not go on, not now.	Angikwazanga ukuqhubeka, hhayi manje.
I will do that, too.	Ngizokwenza lokho, nami.
Or eat in your room if you like.	Noma udle ekamelweni lakho uma uthanda.
No, he would not have thought that he would need to know.	Cha, ubengeke acabange ukuthi uzodinga ukwazi.
Out in your area.	Ngaphandle endaweni yakho.
Spending everything.	Ukuchitha yonke into.
All right, everybody.	Kulungile, wonke umuntu.
Death can be difficult.	Ukufa kungase kube nzima.
There has been a problem several times.	Kube khona inkinga izikhathi ezimbalwa.
It is difficult to read this time.	Kunzima ukwazi ukufunda lesi sikhathi.
I'm glad to see this happen.	Ngiyajabula ukubona lokhu kwenzeka.
It could be anything.	Kungenzeka ukuthi kungaba lutho.
You work hard on that.	Usebenza kanzima kulokho.
She can't cook.	Akakwazi ukupheka.
That is good for us if it is true.	Lokho kuhle kithi uma kuyiqiniso.
You better do something about it, he thought.	Kungcono wenze okuthile ngalokho, wacabanga.
You know, just to help.	Uyazi, ukusiza nje.
Yes, it is too late.	Yebo, kunalokho sekwephuzile.
Going out for a while.	Ukuphuma ngaphandle isikhashana .
i don't like to talk about it.	angithandi ukukhuluma ngakho.
But he never did.	Kodwa akazange aphinde.
He said that it really is.	Wathi empeleni kunjalo.
Anyway a very good name.	Noma kanjani igama elihle kakhulu.
Clearly or explicitly.	Ngokusobala noma ngokusobala.
He took it very seriously.	Wathatha kakhulu.
Everything you went through.	Konke odlule kukho.
This, of course, is true.	Lokhu, ngempela, kuyiqiniso.
Now in our work.	Manje emsebenzini wethu.
He just doesn't always know.	Akazi nje njalo.
I do all the thinking here.	Ngenza konke ukucabanga lapha.
I like to spend a lot of time with my family.	Ngithanda ukuchitha isikhathi esiningi nomndeni wami.
It all seems to me.	Konke kubonakala kimi.
He goes everywhere.	Uya yonke indawo noma kuphi.
And now, this.	Futhi manje, lokhu.
I would not do that to him.	Bengingeke ngikwenze lokho kuye.
Not all of us.	Angithi sonke.
He knew he would never be the same again.	Wayazi ukuthi wayengeke aphinde abe nguye.
It never really happened.	Akuzange kwenzeke ngempela.
But this is not the case.	Kodwa kulokhu akunjalo.
You want us to make a choice.	Ofuna sikwenze ukukhetha.
This is by no means his fault.	Lokhu akulona neze iphutha lakhe.
You are not human.	Awuyena muntu.
In the meantime, thank you.	Okwamanje, ngiyabonga.
I need to sleep for a while.	Ngidinga ukulala isikhashana.
Or rather he tried.	Noma kunalokho wazama.
His fault.	Iphutha lakhe.
It's just you.	Nguwe nje.
I want to know why.	Ngifuna ukwazi ukuthi kungani kunjalo.
Not in my place.	Hhayi endaweni yami.
Actually a really good idea.	Empeleni umqondo omuhle ngempela.
You would not have it all.	Ubungeke ube nakho konke.
Of course not!	Hhayi ngeke.
How can this not be true ?.	Kanjani lokhu akulona iqiniso?.
If it should, it should.	Uma kufanele, kufanele.
We found that person in the middle.	Sithole lowo muntu phakathi.
But, enough.	Kodwa, ngokwanele.
You never know what a person can do.	Ngeke wazi ukuthi umuntu uyakwazi ukwenzani.
That is not the case at all.	Akukhona lokho nhlobo.
She is happy now.	Ujabule manje.
This could be your dog, your cat, or you.	Lokhu kungaba inja yakho, ikati lakho, noma wena.
I've been thinking about it all day.	Bengilokhu ngicabanga ngakho usuku lonke.
Needless to say, a great place.	Akudingekile ukusho, indawo enkulu.
It will not last long.	Ngeke ahlale isikhathi eside.
What is wrong with me?.	Yini engalungile ngami?.
That's your person.	Lowo muntu wakho.
But lately there is so much more than that.	Kodwa muva nje kuningi kakhulu kunalokho.
For me this time.	Ngami lesi sikhathi.
But not that.	Kodwa hhayi lokho.
Up in the middle.	Phezulu phakathi.
And too long.	Futhi isikhathi eside kakhulu.
He couldn't say that.	Wayengeke akwazi ukusho lokho.
But he did not want his mother to know.	Kodwa wayengafuni ukuthi umama wakhe azi.
If you can do that.	Uma ungakwenza lokho.
You should go to him.	Kufanele uye kuye.
He left home in the afternoon.	Wahamba ekhaya ntambama.
I didn't think you could do it.	Bengingacabangi ukuthi ungakwenza.
All of that will happen soon.	Konke lokho kuzokwenzeka ngokushesha.
I have no other place.	Anginayo enye indawo.
In practice, it sounds too.	Ngokwenza, kuzwakala futhi.
And not for me.	Futhi hhayi kimi.
He could not die now.	Wayengeke akwazi ukufa manje.
One can always find books.	Umuntu angakwazi njalo ukuthola izincwadi.
Not much is happening in the office.	Akukho okuningi okwenzekayo ehhovisi.
But they say that it is good.	Kodwa bathi lokho kuhle.
Maybe I should go.	Mhlawumbe kuzofanele ngihambe.
He did so here.	Wenza kanjalo lapha.
This happened a few times.	Lokhu kwenzeka izikhathi ezimbalwa.
We can't try anything new.	Asikwazi ukuzama noma yini entsha.
But maybe.	Kodwa mhlawumbe .
That is what happened this morning.	Yilokho okwenzekile ekuseni.
Not tomorrow, today.	Hhayi kusasa, namuhla.
He certainly did not want to go to prison.	Impela wayengafuni ukuya ejele.
That is what happened at home.	Kwenzeka kanjalo ekhaya.
We will find nothing today.	Ngeke sithole lutho namuhla.
But you can't stop eating.	Kodwa awukwazi ukuyeka ukudla.
He told me a week.	Wangitshela ngesonto.
I thought it best to be alone.	Ngabona kungcono ukuthi ngize ngedwa.
I'm sorry but it is.	Ngiyaxolisa kodwa kunjalo.
A cute, cute cat.	Ikati elihle, elihle elihle.
Probably not.	Cishe akazange.
This is not your problem.	Lena akuyona inkinga yakho.
Not the first time, you know.	Akukhona okokuqala, uyazi.
I would like to hear a voice.	Ngingathanda ukuzwa izwi.
He wanted to know that.	Wayefuna ukwazi lokho.
I was thinking that.	Bengicabanga lokho.
Much of it is obviously true.	Okuningi kwakho kuyiqiniso ngokusobala.
It's my decision, 'he said.	Isinqumo sami,' usho kanje.
There must be something.	Kumelwe ukuba kukhona okuthile .
It may be soon.	Kungenzeka maduze.
No, no, this will not happen.	Cha, cha, ngeke kwenzeke lokhu.
Actually everything.	Empeleni konke.
And, yes you made a mistake.	Futhi, yebo wenza iphutha.
He realized that it was not his place to do so.	Wabona ukuthi akuyona indawo yakhe ukwenza kanjalo.
I'm not sure how it could be better.	Angiqiniseki ukuthi kungaba ngcono kanjani.
A few days, a week at least.	Izinsuku ezimbalwa, isonto okungenani.
Here in his house.	Lapha endlini yakhe.
You want to drink plenty of water all day.	Ufuna ukuphuza amanzi amaningi usuku lonke.
The boy spoke loudly.	Umfana wakhuluma kakhulu.
Because there is no story.	Ngoba ayikho indaba.
Other.	Okunye .
Man, you are beautiful.	Muntu, muhle.
Or death.	Noma ukufa.
That is my plan.	Icebo lami lelo.
He thought it was well done.	Wayecabanga ukuthi kwenziwe kahle.
Today she is gone.	Namuhla akekho.
He really wants to.	Uyafuna ngempela.
I need to do something about that.	Ngidinga ukwenza okuthile ngalokho.
It can be difficult to keep going.	Kungaba nzima ukuqhubeka.
Lots of stuff, maybe.	Izinto eziningi, mhlawumbe.
I do not want another child.	Angifuni enye ingane.
Or he wouldn’t try it with me.	Noma wayengeke azame nami.
This is not really my biggest problem.	Lena akuyona inkinga yami enkulu ngempela.
This time it was there.	Lesi sikhathi sibe lapho.
Not just him.	Hhayi yena kuphela.
I don't see any way in that yet.	Angiboni noma iyiphi indlela kulokho okwamanje.
I will not be with you there.	Ngeke ngibe nawe lapho.
You must be going to work.	Kumele ngabe uya emsebenzini.
And you should never have to do that.	Futhi akufanele neze kudingeke wenze kanjalo.
Now more.	Manje okunye.
I could not go to my home.	Angikwazanga ukuya ekhaya lami.
I'm not really sure why this happened.	Angiqiniseki ngempela ukuthi kungani lokhu kwenzeka.
And he should not do that.	Futhi akufanele akwenze lokho.
Much later when that happens.	Okuningi kamuva uma lokho kwenzeka.
But there is no certainty.	Kodwa asikho isiqiniseko.
Now my whole family is working with us.	Manje wonke umndeni wami usebenza nathi.
He will be here soon.	Uzoba lapha maduze nje.
But no mother wants to hear that.	Kodwa akekho umama ofuna ukuzwa lokho.
I would like you to go with me.	Ngingathanda ukuthi uhambe nami.
He actually looks surprised.	Empeleni ubukeka emangele.
They would love to spend more time together.	Angathanda ukuchitha isikhathi esiningi ndawonye.
And she is actually very beautiful.	Futhi empeleni muhle kakhulu.
So he has to make good money.	Ngakho kufanele enze imali enhle.
You will not earn money, but you will not have everything.	Ngeke uthole imali, kodwa ngeke ube nakho konke.
Yes, we do too.	Yebo, nathi.
Finally let me tell you one thing.	Ekugcineni ake ngikutshele into eyodwa.
This will now not be necessary.	Lokhu ngeke manje kudingeke.
I wanted a whole week to think.	Ngangifuna isonto lonke ukucabanga.
He spoke ill of me.	Wakhuluma kabi kimi.
Her father, almost.	Ubaba wakhe, cishe.
Let me think about all of that.	Ake ngicabange ngakho konke lokho.
He wanted, all the time.	Wayefuna, ngaso sonke isikhathi.
At that time he used to stay at home.	Ngaleso sikhathi wayevame ukuhlala kwakhe.
The food here is also good.	Ukudla lapha nakho kuhle.
Because we did.	Ngoba senze.
Something is happening all the time.	Kukhona okwenzeka njalo.
At home, one can really walk away.	Ekhaya, umuntu angase ahambe ngempela.
He did it once.	Wenze kanye.
But that's fine, that's fine.	Kodwa lokho kulungile, kulungile ngokuphelele.
He tried to make sense of all of this.	Wazama ukwenza umqondo kukho konke lokhu.
And again completely.	Futhi futhi ngokuphelele.
It's been a good thing.	Kube yinto enhle.
I found it anyway, anyway.	Ngithole kunjalo, noma kunjalo.
And it will only get better.	Futhi kuzoba ngcono kuphela.
There is a danger in this.	Kukhona ingozi kulokhu.
In my new house.	Endlini yami entsha.
I have had to feel my way so far.	Kuye kwadingeka ngizwe indlela yami kuze kube manje.
I really enjoy it.	Ngijabule ngayo ngempela.
So we want more.	Ngakho sifuna okwengeziwe.
Well, he wasn't sure what to do.	Hhayi, wayengenaso isiqiniseko sokuthi enzeni.
He went into the bathroom.	Wangena endlini encane.
He is leaving in the morning.	Uzohamba ekuseni.
Maybe he can make this work.	Mhlawumbe angakwenza lokhu kube umsebenzi.
He came in like this.	Wangena kanje.
But it probably happened.	Kodwa cishe kwenzeka.
Danger in the world.	Ingozi emhlabeni.
That's the worst of it all.	Yilokho okubi kakhulu kwakho.
Identifying the problem.	Ukuthola inkinga.
He made a bad impression almost immediately.	Wenza umbono omubi cishe ngokushesha.
You've been here long enough to know this.	Ube lapha isikhathi eside ngokwanele ukwazi lokhu.
I don't see how it really is.	Angiboni ukuthi kanjani ngempela.
I sit at a table.	Ngihlale etafuleni.
I want it fast.	Ngifuna ngokushesha.
I would like to read his books.	Ngingathanda ukufunda izincwadi zakhe.
Church name.	Isonto igama.
This is not a good time now.	Akusona isikhathi esihle manje.
His death means nothing to us.	Ukufa kwakhe akusho lutho kithi.
He's a great guy.	Uyinsizwa enkulu .
I did not want to hurt anyone.	Ngangingafuni muntu kabi.
This is nothing new.	Lokhu akuyona into entsha yebo.
He works here so he should know what is good.	Usebenza lapha ngakho kufanele azi ukuthi yini enhle.
I'm so sorry, but it's me.	Ngiyaxolisa kakhulu, kodwa yimina.
And he can sing.	Futhi uyakwazi ukucula.
I do that all the time.	Ngenza lokho ngaso sonke isikhathi.
In fact, it looks very good.	Empeleni, kubonakala kuhle kakhulu.
I know almost nothing about it.	Angazi cishe lutho ngakho.
I'm actually happy.	Empeleni ngijabule.
But he did it, he did it.	Kodwa wakwenza, wakwenza.
I just feel it.	Ngizwa nje .
I just want to help.	Ngifuna ukusiza nje.
That is what we needed to do.	Yilokho okwakudingeka sikwenze.
He wanted to commit a crime.	Wayefuna enze icala.
I do, many times.	Ngenza, izikhathi eziningi.
If so, it will not last long.	Uma kunjalo, ngeke abe isikhathi eside.
He is going to town.	Uya edolobheni.
And there is not much extra time.	Futhi asikho isikhathi esengeziwe esiningi.
I wanted to be a great mom, too.	Ngangifuna ukuba umama omkhulu, futhi.
He thought he would never know.	Wayecabanga ukuthi ngeke azi.
He is not his person.	Akayena umuntu wakhe.
Everything looks obvious.	Konke kubukeka kusobala.
Some may be helpful to you.	Okunye kungase kube usizo kuwe.
Just his car.	Imoto yakhe nje.
That might be okay, too.	Lokho kungenzeka kulungile, futhi.
Obviously, that is the case.	Ngokusobala, kunjalo.
Hopefully you did too !.	Ngethemba nawe wenza kanjalo!.
He always says that.	Ukhuluma kanjalo njalo.
She seemed happy.	Wabonakala ejabule.
He can't be with us.	Angeke nathi.
Because he is just like you.	Ngoba ufana nawe.
Think about it.	Ake ucabange ngakho.
Yes, indeed.	Yebo, kunjalo ngempela.
Maybe he should have left.	Mhlawumbe bekufanele ahambe.
He tried hard to control himself.	Wazama kanzima ukuzibamba.
I mean, thank you.	Ngisho, ngiyabonga.
You should be feeling better.	Bekufanele ngabe uzizwa kahle.
I have been waiting my whole life for this moment.	Ngilinde impilo yami yonke ngalesi sikhathi.
And no one else, apparently.	Futhi akekho omunye, ngokusobala.
Or not.	Noma akunjalo.
I can't sleep or eat.	Angikwazi ukulala noma ukudla.
No, that is his name.	Cha, igama lakhe lelo.
So there really isn’t a reason.	Ngakho asikho ngempela isizathu.
Clearly, he could not have imagined it.	Kusobala ukuthi akakwazanga nhlobo ukucabanga kahle ngakho.
Good music will do just that.	Umculo omuhle uzokwenza lokho.
This is really me.	Impela yimi lo.
Slowly but surely.	Kancane kancane kodwa.
He could not have known better.	Wayengeke azi kangcono.
Crying a little.	Ukukhala kancane.
He pretended to be a car.	Wenze sengathi imoto.
Maybe just a little bit.	Mhlawumbe kancane nje.
All he has to do is wait.	Okufanele akwenze ukulinda.
I will not be a father.	Angeke ngibe ubaba.
He died in his bed.	Washona embhedeni wakhe.
Probably not very good.	Mhlawumbe hhayi muhle kakhulu.
It's hard to read, of course.	Kunzima ukufunda, kunjalo.
He wanted to do more.	Wayefuna ukwenza okwengeziwe.
In prison, you got your dinner right away.	Ejele, uthole isidlo sakho sakusihlwa ngaleso sikhathi.
Lies to you and about you.	Amanga kuwe futhi ngawe.
Thank you, for all that really.	Ngiyabonga, ngakho konke ngempela.
But food, or food, is okay.	Kodwa ukudla, noma ukudla, kulungile.
I know it to be true.	Ngiyazi ukuthi kuyiqiniso.
But enough, already.	Kodwa ngokwanele, kakade.
I have to go here.	Kumele ngihambe lapha.
He will not be able to continue this.	Angeke akwazi ukuqhubeka nalokhu.
It's not 'really that hard.	Akunjalo' ngempela ukuthi kunzima.
You will definitely be here.	Impela uzoba lapha.
That looks real.	Lokho kubukeka kuyiqiniso.
But a lot of you.	Kodwa okuningi kwakho.
He kept looking outside.	Wahlala wabheka ngaphandle.
He could not see the other children.	Akakwazanga ukubona ezinye izingane.
Maybe not like before.	Mhlawumbe hhayi njengakuqala.
As you say, by work, not work.	Njengoba usho, ngomsebenzi, hhayi umsebenzi.
But he can't take a chance.	Kodwa akakwazi ukuthatha ithuba.
I would love to see you anytime.	Ngingathanda ukukubona noma nini.
But in the end yes.	Kodwa ekugcineni yebo.
We may have a family.	Kungenzeka sibe nomndeni.
I want to be with her all the time.	Ngifuna ukuba naye ngaso sonke isikhathi.
We did very well, you and I.	Senze kahle kakhulu, wena nami.
He told me what was going on there.	Wangitshela ukuthi kwenzekani lapho.
He could not come.	Akakwazanga ukufika.
I've always thought she was so beautiful.	Bengilokhu ngicabanga ukuthi muhle kakhulu.
He is here today.	Ukhona namuhla.
I don't think he should talk.	Angicabangi ukuthi kufanele akhulume.
Because you want to know.	Ngoba ufuna ukwazi.
Everyone is very happy about it.	Wonke umuntu ujabule kakhulu ngakho.
I really could not.	Ngempela angikwazanga.
You love it so much, that's the problem.	Uthanda kakhulu, inkinga leyo.
I want to find out what is wrong.	Ngifuna ukuthola ukuthi yini engalungile.
I would like to stop talking.	Ngingathanda ukuyeka ukukhuluma.
I know, and we know, the right thing to do.	Ngiyazi, futhi siyazi, into efanele ukuyenza.
I could not stop thinking about you.	Angikwazanga ukuyeka ukucabanga ngawe.
He would not want to talk about it.	Wayengeke afune ukukhuluma ngakho.
That he'll be back soon, you know.	Ukuthi uzobuya maduze, uyazi.
Something for the weekend.	Okuthile ngempelasonto.
But maybe this is too hard.	Kodwa mhlawumbe lokhu kunzima kakhulu.
I did a little bit.	Ngenza kancane.
I don't know, that's right.	Angazi, kunjalo.
Obviously.	Kusobala ukuthi .
It will be something new.	Kuzoba yinto entsha.
The teacher was surprised.	Uthisha wamangala.
You need to hear this.	Udinga ukuzwa lokhu.
I would like some help.	Ngingathanda ukuthola usizo.
I want to live, not just be there.	Ngifuna ukuphila, hhayi nje ukuba khona.
I mean we both want you to be happy all the time.	Ngisho ukuthi sobabili sifuna ujabule ngaso sonke isikhathi.
It will not be easy.	Ngeke sibe lula.
He can walk, but not always.	Angakwazi ukuhamba, kodwa hhayi njalo njalo.
But the big answer.	Kodwa impendulo enkulu.
I think you should be there.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kufanele ube lapho.
I know about everything.	Ngazi ngakho konke.
But long enough.	Kodwa isikhathi eside ngokwanele.
He speaks all the way.	Ukhuluma indlela yonke.
I told you to think.	Ngikutshele ukuthi ucabange.
I saw what he did.	Ngabona ukuthi wenzeni.
So really, or one.	Ngakho ngempela, noma eyodwa.
It should have been.	Bekufanele kube .
No one really knows how much.	Akekho owaziyo ngempela ukuthi kangakanani.
But he is not sure if he can.	Kodwa akanaso isiqiniseko sokuthi angakwazi.
But in reality it is not at all.	Kodwa empeleni akunjalo neze.
I mean, it has to be.	Ngisho, kufanele kube.
But it may be more than you think.	Kodwa kungase kube kuningi kakhulu kunalokho ocabanga ngakho.
This is my way of doing it.	Lena indlela yami yokwenza.
Just a few pictures.	Izithombe ezimbalwa nje.
It can only be the police.	Kungaba amaphoyisa kuphela.
He felt absent.	Wazizwa engekho.
But that's just as it should be.	Kodwa lokho kuphela njengoba kufanele kube.
I'm talking about you.	Ngikhuluma ngani .
I never thought of pain in me.	Angikaze ngicabange ubuhlungu kimi.
Everything else has been so much easier.	Konke okunye kube lula kakhulu.
Another idea for me.	Omunye umqondo ngami.
I think she is so beautiful.	Ngicabanga ukuthi muhle kangako.
That, simply, would not happen.	Lokho, kalula, ngeke kwenzeke.
You just need a good friend.	Udinga nje umngane omuhle.
He could not return to it.	Akakwazanga ukubuyela kukho.
Or, it could be tomorrow.	Noma, kungaba kusasa.
We won't have much time together before you leave.	Ngeke sibe nesikhathi esiningi ndawonye ngaphambi kokuthi uhambe.
He refused his money.	Wenqaba imali yakhe.
He looked up, amazed.	Wabuka, wamangala.
I'm not sure yet.	Angazi kahle okwamanje.
And so it is with everything else.	Futhi kunjalo kukho konke okunye.
It is not the only reason for you to stay.	Akusona isizathu kuphela sokuthi uhlale.
Whenever you say.	Noma nini usho.
It will happen soon, of course.	Kuzokwenzeka maduze, kunjalo.
But this does not mean anything.	Kodwa lokhu akusho lutho.
No waiting at all.	Akukho ukulinda nhlobo.
But from then on, it can be difficult.	Kodwa kusukela lapho, kungase kube nzima.
He really wanted to fix that.	Wayefuna ngempela ukulungisa lokho.
And he wanted to know.	Futhi wayefuna ukwazi.
Sounds like me.	Kuzwakala njengami.

I can't stop eating.	Angikwazi ukuyeka ukudla.
You do not have to get married.	Awudingi ukushada.
I could not see the problem.	Angikwazanga ukubona inkinga.

And now that's it.	Futhi manje yilokho.
I would love to have this in one place.	Ngingathanda ukuba nalokhu endaweni eyodwa.
I do not remember very well.	Angisakhumbuli kahle impela.

We should not have done this.	Bekungafanele sikwenze lokhu.
I can't imagine how he did it.	Angikwazi ukucabanga ukuthi ukwenza kanjani.
You know, a little bit like this.	Uyazi, kancane kanje.

He saw that he had to eat now.	Wabona ukuthi kumele adle manje.
You just started working here.	Usanda kuqala ukusebenza lapha.
It's hard for me to find a word.	Kunzima ukuthi ngithole izwi.
We should both have it.	Sobabili kufanele sibe nakho.
Please tell, whats the story of them big puppys .....	Ngicela ungitshele ukuthi ukwenze kanjani.

To see what is happening.	Ukuze abone okwenzekayo.
If anything has to happen to me.	Uma kukhona okumele kwenzeke kimi.

But he just wanted to talk.	Kodwa wayefuna nje ukukhuluma.
At your school.	Esikoleni sakho.
I have to talk about it, but in my own way.	Kufanele ngikhulume ngakho, kodwa ngendlela yami.
That's a really big thing.	Yinto enkulu ngempela leyo.
No other car.	Ayikho enye imoto.
And he knows nothing about it.	Futhi akazi lutho ngalokhu.
He started working outside.	Waqala ukusebenza ngaphandle.
He never has, he never will.	Akakaze abe nakho, akasoze abe nakho.
Well, this time.	Kuhle, lesi sikhathi.
Or in the afternoon people.	Noma ntambama abantu.
And, needless to say, to be alone.	Futhi, akudingekile ukusho, ukuba wedwa.

He always talks about her.	Uhlala ekhuluma ngaye.
He feels it all.	Uzizwa konke.
So, he knew.	Ngakho, wayazi.
You did it yourself.	Wenze njalo wena.
It should have been easy to fix this.	Bekufanele kube lula ukulungisa lokhu.
I realized now that it would not.	Ngabona manje ukuthi ngeke.
He is not at all.	Akekho nhlobo.
At least he did that later.	Okungenani wakwenza lokho kamuva.

But he knew it very well.	Kodwa wakwazi kahle kakhulu.
She thought he looked bad.	Wayecabanga ukuthi ubukeka kabi.

I'd better get a call.	Kungcono ngithole ucingo.
Very, very likely.	Kakhulu, mhlawumbe kakhulu.

And it's hard to do it right.	Futhi kunzima ukwenza ngendlela efanele.
It is good to go with him.	Kuhle ukuhamba naye.

There is a new one almost every day.	Kukhona entsha cishe nsuku zonke.
Or soon.	Noma ngokushesha.
And the answer.	Futhi impendulo.
You didn't do it.	Awuzange ukwenze.
No matter what you do to him.	Noma ngabe wenzani kuye.

Big, big money.	Imali enkulu, enkulu.
And he began to speak.	Futhi waqala ukukhuluma.
As you wish, you will be in it.	Njengoba ufisa, uzoba kukho.

Our little baby.	Ingane yethu encane.
Not so last year.	Akunjalo ngonyaka odlule.
That's why he knows everything about me.	Yingakho azi konke ngami.

There is nothing in this.	Akukho lutho kulokhu.
But speaking is not really true.	Kodwa ukukhuluma akulona iqiniso ngempela.

It would be nice to get a little better.	Kungaba kuhle ukuba ngcono kancane kancane.

But for now, it's better to play together.	Kodwa okwamanje, kungcono ukudlala ndawonye.

He probably should have done it right away.	Cishe kwakufanele akwenze ngaso leso sikhathi.
No, he could not.	Cha, akakwazanga ukwenza lokhu.
Just one book.	Incwadi eyodwa nje.
The police can make a mistake.	Amaphoyisa angenza iphutha.

You do not need anything.	Awudingi lutho.
We found his name.	Sithole igama lakhe.
You always do the right thing.	Ngaso sonke isikhathi wenza okufanele.

But not close.	Kodwa hhayi eduze.
If only a few hours.	Uma nje amahora ambalwa.
Just because you can, doesn't mean you should.	Ukuthi ungakwazi, akusho ukuthi kufanele.
There it is again.	Kukhona lapho futhi.
Or flowers.	Noma izimbali.
He does not know what to do.	Akazi ukuthi enzeni.
Everything had to be fine.	Konke kwakufanele kube kuhle.

What are you trying to do here.	Uzama ukwenzani lapha.
Of course he would not.	Yebo wayengeke.

That, he couldn't do it.	Lokho, akakwazanga ukukwenza.
Everyone eats together.	Wonke umuntu udla ndawonye.
She wanted to be with him again.	Wayefuna ukuba naye futhi.
To get your name.	Ukuze uthole igama lakho.
He made sense.	Wenza umqondo.
Or maybe so, but not only that.	Noma mhlawumbe kunjalo, kodwa hhayi lokho kuphela.
Either way there is a new life.	Noma iyiphi indlela kukhona impilo entsha.

And sometimes it's hard.	Futhi ngezinye izikhathi kunzima.
I found his place.	Ngithole indawo yakhe.

This obviously should be the case.	Lokhu ngokusobala kufanele kube njalo.
He used to think so.	Wayevame ukucabanga kanjalo.
But it was really worth it.	Kodwa kwakufanele ngempela.
Maybe that will happen.	Mhlawumbe lokho kuzokwenzeka.
You have to go to school.	Kufanele uye esikoleni.
He says everyone should go now.	Uthi wonke umuntu kumele ahambe manje.
He never stopped walking.	Akazange ayeke ukuhamba.
It could be that it is not.	Kungaba ukuthi akunjalo.
You should not have thought about him.	Akufanele ngabe ucabanga ngaye.
You will need help to make it happen.	Uzodinga usizo ukuze kwenzeke.

And that would only be good.	Futhi lokho kungaba kuhle kuphela.
But all of us.	Kodwa nathi sonke.
It’s clear to us, at least.	Kusobala kithi, okungenani.
And it has been difficult.	Futhi kube nzima.

In this case, however.	Kulokhu, noma kunjalo.

But this was not the case.	Kodwa kwakungeyena lo.
Everyone can have it, and everyone should.	Wonke umuntu angaba nakho, futhi wonke umuntu kufanele.

There seems to be something there.	Kubonakala sengathi kukhona okuthile lapho.
He is waiting to speak with us.	Ulindele ukukhuluma nathi.
I never thought it would be a job.	Angikaze ngicabange ukuthi kuzoba umsebenzi.
I have never seen anything in him.	Angikaze ngibone lutho kuye.
Because that's my name.	Ngoba lelo igama lami.

Tell me what you did.	Ngitshele ukuthi wenzeni.
But he will not talk to you.	Kodwa ngeke akhulume nawe.
I never said anything about that.	Angikaze ngisho lutho kulokho.
As it will take.	Njengoba kuzothatha.
Maybe that's my problem.	Mhlawumbe inkinga yami leyo.
Everyone can do what they want to do.	Wonke umuntu angenza lokho afuna ukukwenza.
Just talking to him this.	Ukukhuluma nje naye lokhu.
Now she did not know how she felt about him.	Manje wayengazi ukuthi uzizwa kanjani ngaye.
I would not go.	bengingeke ngihambe.
You really need to go.	Udinga ukuhamba ngempela.
That is what everyone deserves.	Yilokho okufanele wonke umuntu.
But the same thing.	Kodwa into efanayo.
But a child.	Kodwa ingane.
This has been happening for a long time.	Lokhu kwenzeka isikhathi eside.
At least with him.	Okungenani naye.
I think of other things.	Ngicabanga ngezinye izinto.
Not why.	Hhayi ukuthi kungani.
You will be a better father.	Uzoba ubaba ongcono.
He just wanted to talk to her.	Wayefuna nje ukukhuluma naye.
And stop thinking too much.	Futhi yeka ukucabanga kakhulu.
I don't really want that.	Angifuni ngempela lokho.
I'm sorry about that, but there it is.	Ngiyaxolisa ngakho, kodwa kukhona.
Just like that, too.	Kanjalo nje, futhi.
Work is a thing.	Umsebenzi yinto.
I just wanted to be with myself.	Ngangifuna nje ukuba nami.
Just so you know.	Ukuze wazi nje.
Not really what you want to do.	Akunjalo ngempela ofuna ukuzenza.
It's hard to even talk to you.	Kunzima ngisho ukukhuluma nawe.
As you say, obviously.	Njengoba usho, kusobala.
I did not speak or see anyone.	Angizange ngikhulume noma ngibone muntu.
Not here, and probably nowhere.	Hhayi lapha, futhi mhlawumbe akukho ndawo.
Thank you.	Ngiyabonga .
And there is, in fact, no one who can do it.	Futhi akukho, empeleni, akukho muntu angakwenza ngakho.
You know that's okay.	Uyazi ukuthi kulungile.
I will be there for you.	Ngizoba lapho ngenxa yakho.
Sounds like hours.	Kuzwakala sengathi amahora.
It works well too.	Usebenza kahle futhi.
We will not do this here.	Ngeke sikwenze lokhu lapha.
He did all of this.	Konke lokhu wakwenza.
Stop talking.	Ayeke ukukhuluma.
Probably because that is what happens after you eat a few.	Mhlawumbe ngoba yilokho okwenzeka ngemva kokuba udle ezimbalwa.
He reached the door and pulled out his key.	Wafika emnyango wakhipha ukhiye wakhe.
Not even a crime.	Akulona ngisho icala.
He thought to himself.	Wacabanga yedwa.
But not every day.	Kodwa hhayi zonke izinsuku.
He is talking to you.	Ukhuluma nawe.
And only in the summer.	Futhi kuphela ehlobo.
You need a dog.	Udinga inja.
He says he works very hard.	Uthi usebenza kanzima kakhulu.
But he has to go to school.	Kodwa kumele aye esikoleni.
He did just that.	Wakwenza kahle lokhu.
Some of you are not.	Okunye kwakho akunjalo.
The more you do, the more you learn.	Lapho wenza okwengeziwe, ufunda kakhulu.
Yes, we all want that to happen.	Yebo, sonke sifuna kube njalo.
That's exactly what you like.	Kunjalo njengoba uthanda.
I got to the end, finally.	Ngifike ekugcineni, ekugcineni.
Or at least he thought he did.	Noma okungenani wayecabanga ukuthi ukwenzile.
You know how it happened.	Uyazi ukuthi kwenzeka kanjani.
Not a bit of a problem.	Hhayi kancane inkinga.
He may not be so bad at all.	Kungenzeka ukuthi akayena umuntu omubi kangako.
John has to leave tomorrow.	UJohn kufanele ahambe kusasa.
It looks like a human being.	Kubonakala sengathi umuntu.
What a reason.	Yini isizathu.
I think he is coming this week.	Ngicabanga ukuthi uyeza kuleli sonto.
And that he couldn't do it.	Nokuthi akakwazanga ukukwenza.
And it is not necessary at all.	Futhi akudingekile neze.
I'm here for the day.	Ngilapha usuku.
He did not stay at all.	Akazange ahlale nhlobo.
I just need an idea.	Ngidinga nje umbono.
Why, he asked, but he was not sure.	Kungani, wabuza, kodwa wayengenaso isiqiniseko.
You need a job.	Udinga umsebenzi.
I want to stay in the middle.	Ngifuna ukuhlala phakathi.
So that you are not alone.	Ukuze ungabi wedwa.
I just wanted something new.	Bengifuna into entsha nje.
He didn't know if it was right, but he didn't.	Wayengazi noma kufanele, kodwa akazange.
Most of the time it is not a bad thing.	Isikhathi esiningi akuyona into embi.
Tell me if you know.	Ngitshele uma uyazi.
That's what he is.	Yilokho ayikho.
Not without him.	Hhayi ngaphandle kwakhe.
We can not go on at all.	Asikwazi nhlobo ukuqhubeka.
Where do you live ?.	Uhlala kuphi?.
This is not a picture.	Akusona isithombe lesi.
It will happen in the end.	Kuzokwenzeka ekugcineni.
I can't go to jail.	Angikwazi ukuya ejele.
Probably always.	Mhlawumbe ngaso sonke isikhathi.
Even new.	Ngisho entsha.
And not just for me.	Futhi hhayi nje ngami.
You want to know what's wrong.	Ufuna ukwazi ukuthi yini engalungile.
You must say no.	Kumele uthi cha.
I'm not sure what to think about this.	Angiqiniseki ukuthi yini okumele ngicabange ngalokhu.
Not your time.	Asikho isikhathi sakho.
He would not talk to me in this way.	Wayengeke akhulume nami ngale ndlela.
You got it all.	Uthole konke.
Nice to see you too.	Ngiyajabula ukukubona nawe.
I'll have to talk to him about it.	Kuzodingeka ngikhulume naye ngakho.
It has to be done perfectly.	Kufanele kwenziwe ngokuphelele.
Ability to make friends easily.	Ukwazi ukwenza abangani kalula.
You are quite wrong.	Unephutha impela.
Slightly enough as it is.	Kancane ngokwanele njengoba kunjalo.
He thought again.	Wayecabanga futhi.
Or she is very beautiful.	Noma muhle kakhulu.
We need to get out the back.	Sidinga ukuphuma ngemuva.
But it can also be something more.	Kodwa futhi kungaba okunye okwengeziwe.
He was terrified of the worst.	Wayesaba okubi kakhulu.
She is very happy now.	Ujabule kakhulu manje.
He knew that was going to be a plan.	Wayazi ukuthi kuzoba icebo lelo.
But something else happened over the weekend.	Kodwa kukhona okunye okwenzeka ngempelasonto.
But if you do, that's fine.	Kodwa uma wenza kanjalo, kulungile.
I always knew that was true.	Bengilokhu ngazi ukuthi kuyiqiniso lokho.
I really like when that happens.	Ngithanda kakhulu uma lokho kwenzeka.
Or he thought he was.	Noma wayecabanga ukuthi uyena.
I should have gone home.	Kufanele ngabe ngiya ekhaya.
So far, so good.	Kuze kube manje, kusobala.
But he can't go with us.	Kodwa akakwazi ukuhamba nathi.
I have to go to my room for a while.	Kufanele ngiye ekamelweni lami isikhashana.
I can't wait to try.	Angikwazi ukulinda ukuzama.
There is really no such thing.	Ayikho ngempela into enjalo.
How difficult that is.	Kunzima kangakanani lokho.
I want to get a picture.	Ngifuna ukuthola isithombe.
I just want him back.	Ngifuna abuye nje.
We all do, in our own way.	Sonke senza, ngendlela yethu.
All you have to do is come.	Okufanele ukwenze ukuza.
I thought you did a great job.	Ngangicabanga ukuthi wenze umsebenzi omuhle kakhulu.
He just started riding his bike.	Wavele waqala ukugibela ibhayisikili.
You can not go home again.	Awukwazi ukuya ekhaya futhi.
But anything to me.	Kodwa noma yini kimi.
He is taller and slower.	Mude futhi naye kancane kancane.
Still, not quite well.	Noma kunjalo, hhayi kahle.
Something is happening all the time here.	Kukhona okwenzeka njalo lapha.
I don’t want to see everything.	Angifuni ukubona yonke into.
You have to think about that yourself.	Kufanele ucabange ngalokho wena.
Money is not everything and it is not the only thing.	Imali akuyona yonke into futhi akuyona into kuphela.
No, not at all.	Cha, akukho nhlobo.
I think that’s what everyone should do.	Ngicabanga ukuthi yilokho wonke umuntu okufanele akwenze.
I could not wait.	Angikwazanga ukulinda.
He always is.	Uhlala kunjalo.
He knew nothing about me.	Wayengazi lutho ngami.

You can sing.	Ungakwazi ukucula.
We need more money.	Sidinga imali eningi.
He would never be alone again.	Wayengeke aphinde abe yedwa.
I need a team.	Ngidinga iqembu.
But again, that is not true.	Kodwa futhi, akulona iqiniso.
Since then, more has happened.	Kusukela lapho, kuye kwenzeka okwengeziwe.
We know that sometimes that is difficult.	Siyazi ukuthi ngezinye izikhathi kunzima lokho.
Great bad job.	Umsebenzi omubi omkhulu.
In the end, it should.	Ekugcineni, kufanele.
I also could not cry.	Nami angikwazanga ukukhala.
But this can only happen locally.	Kodwa lokhu kungenzeka kuphela endaweni.
Now that is obvious to me.	Manje lokho kusobala kimi.
I don’t like to think about it too much.	Angithandi ukucabanga ngakho kakhulu.
Would you not know.	Ubungeke yini wazi.
But only if no one knows.	Kodwa kuphela ukube akekho owaziyo.
But you did what you had to do.	Kodwa wenza lokho okufanele ukwenze.
Only a small space and not a lot of clothes.	Indawo encane kuphela futhi hhayi izingubo eziningi.
Not a lot of money.	Hhayi imali eningi.
Why did he do that.	Kungani enze lokho.
You can't either.	Awukwazi futhi.
I found out why that happened.	Ngithole ukuthi kungani kwenzeka lokho.
He lives here on earth.	Uhlala lapha emhlabeni.
Not quite close.	Hhayi impela eduze.
Or almost all of them.	Noma cishe yonke.
I do not want to continue like that.	Angifuni ukuqhubeka kanjalo.
I need your help.	Ngicela usizo lwakho.
It's not the right thing to do.	Akuyona into efanele ukuyenza.
I will never talk about this again.	Ngeke ngiphinde ngikhulume ngalokhu.
I thought everyone knew.	Ngangicabanga ukuthi wonke umuntu uyazi.
It's you and no one else.	Nguwe hhayi omunye.
No story there.	Ayikho indaba lapho.
He will not help.	Ngeke asize.
The department knows about it.	Umnyango uyazi ngakho.
He too was good at that.	Naye waba muhle kulokho.
I could not be with you.	Angikwazanga ukuba nawe.
I knew right away.	Ngazi ngaso leso sikhathi.
He wanted to come back.	Wayefuna abuye.
So my friend.	Ngakho umngane wami.
Certainly not today.	Impela akunjalo namuhla.
I arrived late.	Ngifike sekwephuzile.
We did it for him.	Senze kuye.
So he stayed home.	Ngakho wahlala ekhaya.
Somewhere he knows.	Kukhona lapho azi khona.
But my spirit.	Kodwa umoya wami.
But, you should know where you are.	Kodwa, kufanele wazi lapho ukhona.
He never told me what to do.	Akazange angitshele ukuthi ngenzeni.
He said he would probably be here all week.	Wathi cishe uzoba lapha isonto lonke.
our whole answer.	impendulo yethu yonke.
I wonder if that idea ?.	Kazi umqondo lowo?.
I don't know who to help first.	Angazi ukuthi ngisize bani kuqala.
But he would not be friends again.	Kodwa wayengeke aphinde abe umngane.
I doubt he exists, but he can be.	Ngiyangabaza ukuthi ukhona, kodwa angaba njalo.
Really hard outside.	Impela kunzima ngaphandle.
He started eating too much, talking too much.	Waqala ukudla kakhulu, ekhuluma kakhulu.
From the last few years.	Kusukela eminyakeni embalwa edlule.
I can't do it then.	Ngeke ngikwazi ukukwenza ngaleso sikhathi.
Something happened to me there.	Kukhona okwenzeka kimi lapho.
I'd like to go for a walk.	Ngingathanda ukuhamba isikhashana.
First, do not do that.	Okokuqala, ungakwenzi lokho.
Dinner in town tonight.	Isidlo sakusihlwa edolobheni namuhla ebusuku.
Nothing is happening to us yet.	Akukho okwenzeka kithi okwamanje.
And he's trying to be.	Futhi uzama ukuba.
Football but.	Ibhola kodwa.
I did the same thing.	Nami ngenze into efanayo.
You will have to stay here.	Kuzofanele uhlale lapha.
You probably feel worse than I do.	Cishe uzizwa kabi kunami.
Actually a really good question.	Empeleni umbuzo omuhle ngempela.
That will not be the case.	Ngeke kube njalo lokho.
But it is not a lie.	Kodwa akuwona amanga.
He came with us.	Weza nathi.
He became very difficult.	Waba nzima kakhulu.
I mean, it's possible.	Ngisho ukuthi, kungenzeka.
I thought a bit about this.	Ngicabange kancane ngalokhu.
We are doing this now.	Senza lokhu manje.
And don't forget about it.	Futhi ungakhohlwa ngakho.
She feels happy.	Uzizwa ejabule.
We do it our way.	Senza ngendlela yethu.
Now you have to do that again.	Manje kufanele ukwenze lokho futhi.
Also, how long will it take.	Futhi, kuzothatha isikhathi esingakanani.
It would be a bad idea.	Kungaba umqondo omubi.
He wanted to stay in the house.	Wayefuna ukuhlala endlini.
Only not much.	Kuphela hhayi okuningi.
As of today.	Kusukela namuhla.
But it could be entry, anyway.	Kodwa kungaba ukungena, noma kunjalo.
That a lot is immediately apparent.	Lokho okuningi kubonakala ngokushesha.
I just need to know.	Ngidinga ukwazi nje.
It just so happened that I was here.	Kwenzeka lokhu nje ngilapha.
We want something small.	Sifuna into encane.
Why are you talking? 	Kungani ukhuluma?
We must really find the truth.	Kufanele ngempela sithole iqiniso.
I felt that way.	Ngizwe kanjalo.
I cannot tell you exactly when.	Angikwazi ukukutshela kahle ukuthi nini.
But our boy.	Kodwa umfana wethu.
You can do it, you can do it.	Ungakwenza, ungakwenza.
I'm so glad you did.	Ngijabule kakhulu ukuthi uwena.
Money is not a thing.	Imali akuyona into.

Well done today.	Wenze kahle namuhla.
I did not know, why.	Ngangingazi, kungani.

It will be about.	Kuzoba cishe.
There is always water.	Kukhona amanzi njalo.
I did not know both.	Bengingazi nobabili.
I thought it might be better.	Bengicabanga ukuthi kungaba ngcono.
Can you control yourself ?.	Ungakwazi ukuzibamba?.
I feel this way sometimes, too.	Ngizizwa ngale ndlela ngezinye izikhathi, futhi.
And not just pain.	Futhi hhayi nje ubuhlungu.
Is that a bad thing ?.	Yinto embi leyo?.
I'm not even human.	Angiyena ngisho umuntu.
But, how, he wondered.	Kodwa, kanjani, wazibuza.
That can be a big, big problem.	Lokho kungaba inkinga enkulu, enkulu.
That would be very easy for me to do.	Lokho kungaba lula kakhulu kimi ukuba ngikwenze.
Good or not.	Kuhle noma cha.
He could not live with his family.	Akakwazanga ukuhlala nomndeni wakhe.
You, here I am.	Wena, lapha nami.
But your music spoke to me.	Kodwa umculo wakho wakhuluma nami.
He looked down at his coffee.	Wabuka phansi ikhofi lakhe.
Not her name.	Akulona igama lakhe.
I didn’t know, of course.	Bengingazi, kunjalo.

Maybe not now.	Mhlawumbe hhayi manje.
You really have to do it.	Kufanele ukwenze ngempela.
Or maybe not.	Noma mhlawumbe akufanele.
I thought he would go eventually.	Ngicabange ukuthi uzohamba ekugcineni.
I was looking for air.	Ngangifuna umoya.
You probably know me, not him.	Cishe uyazi mina hhayi yena.
So it finally happened.	Ngakho ekugcineni kwenzeka.
Very, really.	Kakhulu, empeleni.
He knew it right away, right away.	Wakwazi ngaleso sikhathi, ngaso leso sikhathi.
No one, no one but me.	Akekho, akekho ngaphandle kwami.
And for me? 	Futhi kimi?
This is your time.	Lesi isikhathi sakho.
I can't say how good it is.	Angikwazi ukukhuluma ukuthi kuhle kangakanani.

Last night, it could be.	Izolo ebusuku, kungaba.
He can't see you today.	Akakwazi ukukubona namuhla.

I would like an answer right now.	Ngingathanda impendulo okwamanje.

But there is no problem.	Kodwa ayikho inkinga.
You can not mistake.	Awukwazi iphutha.
That will obviously take time.	Lokho kusobala kuzothatha isikhathi.
Or even more of you.	Noma ngisho okuningi kwakho.
Yes, it is not there.	Yebo, akukho lapho.
But you know that too.	Kodwa nawe uyakwazi lokho.

But the work went quickly.	Kodwa umsebenzi wahamba ngokushesha.
Not here, not in the room.	Hhayi lapha, hhayi ekamelweni.

There is a lot going on in the area today.	Kuningi okwenzekayo endaweni namuhla.

I do not want to be here without him.	Angifuni ukuba lapha ngaphandle kwakhe.
I don’t really know how to do this.	Angazi ngempela ukuthi ukwenza kanjani lokhu.
Doing too many things is very common at home.	Ukwenza izinto eziningi kwenzeka kakhulu ekhaya.

This may be easier on what you need to do.	Lokhu kungase kube lula kulokho okudingeka ukwenze.

You don't have to do it.	Akumele ukwenze.
Or maybe get a ride.	Noma mhlawumbe uthole ukugibela.
I didn't do it, of course.	Angizange ngikwenze, kunjalo.
Or always even.	Noma ngaso sonke isikhathi ngisho.
It had to be done quickly.	Kwakudingeka kwenziwe ngokushesha.
Good boy at the time.	Umfana omuhle ngaleso sikhathi.
But, now that's fine.	Kodwa, manje lokho kulungile.

But, really, it is.	Kodwa, ngempela, kunjalo.
In this case it is.	Kulokhu kunjalo.
Not every day, but sometimes.	Hhayi nsuku zonke, kodwa ngezinye izikhathi.
Or sometimes all of this at once.	Noma ngezinye izikhathi konke lokhu ngesikhathi esisodwa.
Do not do that.	Ungakwenzi njalo.
And in the back, and together.	Futhi ngemuva, futhi ndawonye.
And that's not even a bad thing.	Futhi lokho akuyona ngisho into embi.
He said.	Wathi.

The need is nothing else.	Isidingo ayikho enye into.
And he did it all week.	Futhi wenze isonto lonke.

People say it can't be done.	Abantu bathi ngeke kwenziwe.
There is no way for me.	Ayikho indlela kimi.

This could be me but.	Lokhu kungaba yimina kodwa.

Without all that.	Ngaphandle kwakho konke lokho.
I don't have my book, just my homework.	Anginayo incwadi yami, umsebenzi wami wesikole kuphela.
But the truth is.	Kodwa iqiniso .
Finding more is not an opportunity.	Ukuthola okunye akulona ithuba.
This is actually the case.	Lokhu empeleni kunjalo.
You really want to do well.	Impela ufuna ukwenza kahle.
So that's why, really.	Ngakho yingakho, ngempela.
Not that he knew, though.	Hhayi ukuthi wayazi, noma kunjalo.

I try to think.	Ngizama ukucabanga.
This, in fact, is what happened.	Lokhu, empeleni, yilokho okwenzeka.
Done, but better ?.	Kwenziwe, kodwa kungcono?.
This can happen very well.	Lokhu kungenzeka kahle.
And that's right, that's right.	Futhi kunjalo, kunjalo.
I do not want to tell you anything.	angifuni ukukutshela lutho.

He can't, of course.	Angeke, kunjalo.
Another good way is to exercise self-control.	Enye indlela enhle ukuzibamba.
But you do not have to do that.	Kodwa akudingekile ukuba wenze lokho.
And it will all be behind you.	Futhi konke kuzoba ngemuva kwakho.

Looks like you know.	Kubonakala sengathi uyazi.
But he lives here.	Kodwa uhlala lapha.
Can I take your name please.	Ngicela igama lakho.

He just spoke.	Wakhuluma nje.
You heard anything here.	Wezwa noma yini lapha.
There is something wrong with him.	Kukhona okuthile kuye.
This is probably good.	Lokhu mhlawumbe kuhle.
In fact, we have done so much more than that.	Empeleni, senze okuningi kakhulu kunalokho.
The boy was afraid to tell anyone.	Umfana wayesaba ukutshela muntu.
I did not mention this.	Angizange ngikhulume lokhu.
I am leaving in the morning.	Ngizohamba ekuseni.
I don't know when it will happen.	Angazi ukuthi kuzokwenzeka nini.
This may be overly easy.	Lokhu kungase kube ukwenza lula ngokweqile.
But imagine that it did not happen.	Kodwa ake ucabange ukuthi akuzange kwenzeke lokho.
I just want to live my life '.	Ngifuna ukuphila impilo yami kuphela'.
And now the answer.	Futhi manje impendulo.
Sometimes that will not be done.	Ngezinye izikhathi lokho ngeke kwenziwe.
Still, he heard enough.	Noma kunjalo, wezwa ngokwanele.
Positive thinking.	Ukucabanga izinto kahle.
I wonder why this is so.	Ngiyazibuza ukuthi kungani lokhu kunjalo.
Your dad usually travels for so long.	Ubaba wakho uvame ukuhamba isikhathi eside kangaka.
And later, too.	Futhi kamuva, futhi.
Now you know that this is possible.	Manje uyazi ukuthi lokhu kungenzeka.
That is not power.	Lokho akuwona amandla.
As if he had never spoken of her before.	Sengathi akakaze akhulume ngaye ngaphambili.

And still sometimes.	Futhi namanje ngezinye izikhathi.
Nothing, he says.	Lutho, uthi.
Or really life.	Noma ngempela ukuphila.
You should not say anything.	Akufanele usho lutho.
No, he finally decided.	Cha, wanquma ekugcineni.
How long do you appear?	Kuze kube nini ubonakala.
So, how do you like clothing ?.	Ngakho, uthanda kanjani ingubo?.
No, it will be in the background.	Hhayi, kuzoba ngemuva.
I'm glad you're happy and that you're here.	Ngiyajabula ukuthi ujabule nokuthi ulapha.
There is no one way to do this.	Ayikho indlela eyodwa yokwenza lokhu.
Unless something happened.	Ngaphandle kokuthi kukhona okwenzekile.
If he has to go, he will go.	Uma kufanele ahambe, uzohamba.
Everyone is convinced of that.	Wonke umuntu uqinisekile ngakho.
Not in the city.	Hhayi edolobheni.
I could not do this job without him.	Angikwazanga ukwenza lo msebenzi ngaphandle kwakhe.
This is a very good question.	Umbuzo omuhle kakhulu lo.
And it's better not to.	Futhi kungcono hhayi.

Yes yes but no.	Yebo yebo kodwa cha.
We want him back soon.	Sifuna abuye ngokushesha.
There is no time to do anything.	Asikho isikhathi sokwenza noma yini.
Sometimes this is true.	Ngezinye izikhathi lokhu kuyiqiniso.
But he was not a man.	Kodwa kwakungeyena umuntu.
Driving too long though.	Ukushayela isikhathi eside kodwa.
I feel it every day.	Ngizizwa nsuku zonke.
It should not be too much work.	Akumele kube umsebenzi omkhulu kakhulu.
We need to redo it.	Sidinga ukulungisa kabusha.
Maybe this will happen or that will happen.	Mhlawumbe lokhu kuzokwenzeka noma lokho kuzokwenzeka.
He thought about this.	Wacabanga ngalokhu.
All you have to do is go out and get it.	Okufanele ukwenze ukuphuma nakho.
But you can't ???.	Kodwa awukwazi???.
He is busy, but good.	Umatasa, kodwa muhle.
But what will it be ?.	Kodwa kuzoba yini?.
I wonder if sometimes.	Ngiyazibuza ukuthi ngezinye izikhathi.
Still, that is not your story.	Noma kunjalo, akuyona indaba yakho leyo.

So far, we have done very well.	Kuze kube manje, senze kahle kakhulu.
I'm not sure it really should.	Angiqiniseki ukuthi kufanele ngempela.

For my father to go home.	Ukuze ubaba ahambe ekhaya.
So we need your help right away.	Ngakho sidinga usizo lwakho ngokushesha.
That did not happen here.	Lokho akuzange kwenzeke lapha.
Hard working.	Ukusebenza kanzima.
No no no, it is not.	Cha cha cha, akunjalo.
That will be something.	Lokho kuzoba okuthile.
So it's not there.	Ngakho akukho lapho.
He wanted to be helpful to me.	Wayefuna ukuba usizo kimi.
It has not been very helpful.	Akuzange kube usizo kakhulu.
So far, it is very difficult.	Kuze kube manje, kunzima kakhulu.
And let me talk about that.	Futhi ake ngikhulume kulokho.
Maybe even a purchase.	Mhlawumbe ngisho ukuthenga.

He is a really great man.	Uyindoda enkulu ngempela.
And, by the way.	Futhi, ngendlela.
A lot is happening right now.	Kuningi okwenzekayo njengamanje.
Not just a few times, either.	Hhayi nje izikhathi ezimbalwa, noma.
He will be alone in his place.	Uzobe eyedwa endaweni yakhe.
All I say is, if he stays there long enough.	Konke ngisho, uma ehlala lapho isikhathi eside ngokwanele.
You think this should never be the case.	Ucabanga ukuthi lokhu akufanele neze.
Because there is nothing at all.	Ngoba akukho nhlobo kukho.
The earlier it is better.	Ngaphambili kungcono.
All right, so he can have dinner with his family.	Kulungile, ukuze adle isidlo sakusihlwa nomndeni wakhe.
I have never seen my children.	Angikaze ngibone izingane zami.
It happens anyway.	Kwenzeka noma kunjalo.
You just want to make sure there is a call.	Ufuna nje ukwenza isiqiniseko sokuthi kukhona ucingo.
I can't work on that.	Angikwazi ukusebenza ngalokho.
There will be no problems there.	Ngeke kube khona izinkinga lapho.

I have to assume you know.	Kufanele ngicabange ukuthi uyakwazi.
It cannot happen all at once.	Angeke kwenzeke konke ngesikhathi esisodwa.
You can't live with that.	Awukwazi ukuphila ngalokho.
I wish you were here with me.	Ngifisa sengathi ngabe ulapha nami.
Still, he entered.	Noma kunjalo, wangena.
But not taking money.	Kodwa hhayi ukuthatha imali.
I want to spend my life with you.	Ngifuna ukuchitha impilo yami nawe.
He can't either.	Naye angeke.

No one knows where it should be.	Akekho owaziyo ukuthi kufanele kuphi.
It should not be because he entered.	Akumele ngoba wangena.
Stupid, just stupid.	Isilima, isilima nje.
Or my mom or dad.	Noma umama noma ubaba wami.

But and everything else.	Kodwa nakho konke okunye.
No, it seems.	Akunjalo, kubonakala kunjalo.
You would not do bad things to his class.	Ubungeke wenze okubi ekilasini lakhe.
But he was not really.	Kodwa wayengeyena ngempela.
All power to you.	Wonke amandla kuwe.

I ask for help if possible.	Ngicela usizo uma kungenzeka.
He decided to sit down for a while.	Wanquma ukuhlala phansi isikhashana.
Not in one place, but everywhere.	Hhayi endaweni eyodwa, kodwa yonke indawo.
But he is always with me.	Kodwa uhlala nami njalo.
We know why.	Siyazi ukuthi kungani.
You can do just that.	Ungakwenza lokho kanye.
He often rode with us almost every morning.	Wayevame ukugibela nathi cishe njalo ekuseni.
He is not in there.	Akekho phakathi lapho.
He just sits there all day.	Uhlezi nje usuku lonke.
Trying to be human.	Ukuzama ukuba umuntu.
But he would not be.	Kodwa wayengeke abe njalo.
But it could not be him again.	Kodwa angeke futhi kube nguye.
I tried very hard.	Ngazama kakhulu.
So man, man.	Ngakho umuntu, umuntu.
He can't stop thinking about that.	Akakwazi ukuyeka ukucabanga ngalokho.
You look so much like him, you know.	Ufana naye kakhulu, uyazi.
He actually looked surprised.	Empeleni wabonakala emangele.
I mean, as little as possible.	Ngisho, kancane ngangokunokwenzeka.
He's just here.	Ulapha nje.
I live in that, too.	Ngihlala kulokho, nami.
I don’t want to think too much.	Angifuni ukucabanga kakhulu.
I should have been there for you no matter what.	Bekufanele ngibe khona kuwe noma ngabe kwenzekani.
I want everyone to know what happened to me.	Ngifuna wonke umuntu azi ukuthi kwenzekani ngami.
I can't wait to see more.	Angikwazi ukulinda ukubona okwengeziwe.
This can be just as dangerous.	Lokhu kungase kube ingozi nje.
He said with his eyes closed.	Usho amehlo akhe.
But, he thought, he thought.	Kodwa, wacabanga, wacabanga.
He decided to drive home.	Wanquma ukushayela ekhaya.
Really, really, really aspiring.	Ngempela, ngempela, ngifisa ngempela.
I didn't want to talk about it.	Ngangingafuni ukukhuluma ngakho.
Bad but true.	Okubi kodwa kuyiqiniso.
We don't really know that yet.	Asikwazi ngempela lokho okwamanje.
He doesn't think though.	Akacabangi kodwa.
And, good idea !.	Futhi, umqondo omuhle!.
No, not a fix.	Cha, hhayi ukulungisa.
I can't take too much.	Angikwazi ukuthatha kakhulu.
It is very good to learn from you.	Kuhle impela ukufunda kuwe.
What he said here is not true.	Ukusho kwakhe lapha akulona iqiniso.
But in the morning.	Kodwa ekuseni .
No one but me.	Akekho ngaphandle kwami.
It seems like it might be very helpful.	Kubonakala sengathi kungase kube usizo kakhulu.
He simply accepted the truth.	Wavele wavuma iqiniso.
Not much, but definitely a little bit.	Hhayi okuningi, kodwa nakanjani kancane.
I want power.	Ngifuna amandla.
Not immediately this.	Hhayi ngokushesha lokhu.
I don't think that should happen.	Ngicabanga ukuthi akufanele kwenzeke lokho.
You have done a wonderful thing today.	Wenze into enhle kakhulu namuhla.
Easily and often.	Kalula futhi kaningi.
You probably do not know.	Cishe awazi.
But he will not know anything about it.	Kodwa ngeke azi lutho ngakho.
I want to know the whole story.	Ngifuna ukwazi yonke indaba.
I'm really sorry yesterday.	Ngiyaxolisa ngempela izolo.
You are not at all a mother.	Awuyena nhlobo umama.
You have to think before you act.	Kufanele ucabange ngaphambi kokuba wenze.
I've seen a little bit.	Ngike ngibone kancane.
At least not for long.	Okungenani hhayi isikhathi eside.
He knew, and he probably knew, too.	Wayazi, futhi cishe wayazi, futhi.
Maybe you can do it.	Mhlawumbe ungakwenza.
Just once in a while.	Kanye nje ngesikhathi.
Not for us.	Hhayi ngathi.
I wanted to talk to you before.	Bengifuna ukukhuluma nawe ngaphambili.
But my story should.	Kodwa indaba yami kufanele.
Nothing to read.	Akukho okufanele ukufunda.
There is just no time.	Asikho nje isikhathi.
He says it all now.	Ukhuluma konke manje.
You and us ?.	Wena nathi?.
But let me tell you what.	Kodwa ngikutshele ukuthini.
Hopefully this will be the case.	Ngethemba ukuthi kuzoba njalo kulokhu.
It happens all the time.	Kwenzeka njalo njalo.
But the boy was not well.	Kodwa umfana wayengekho kahle.
At least, at first.	Okungenani, ekuqaleni.
There is not even a gun.	Akukho ngisho isibhamu.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Ayikho into embi kangaka.
I really want to help.	Ngifuna ngempela ukusiza.
He can always come back.	Angakwazi ukubuyela njalo.
Everyone thinks this way.	Wonke umuntu ucabanga ngale ndlela.
Baby, you know.	Ingane, uyazi.
He never said.	Akakaze asho .
Anyway, thank you.	Noma yini, ngiyabonga.
He can't stay here.	Akakwazi ukuhlala lapha.
I will never see anyone again.	Ngeke ngiphinde ngibone umuntu.
Why.	Kungani kungani.
But you have to tell me.	Kodwa kumele ungitshele.
He does not think that he will stay long.	Akacabangi ukuthi uzohlala isikhathi eside.
Obviously that should not be the case.	Ngokusobala lokho akufanele kube njalo.
It always happens the same way.	Njalo kwenzeka ngendlela efanayo.
At least this one time.	Okungenani ngalesi sikhathi esisodwa.
Not now, but finally.	Hhayi manje, kodwa ekugcineni.
It happens all the time, in the same place.	Kwenzeka ngaso sonke isikhathi, indawo efanayo.
And I was very scared.	Futhi ngesaba kakhulu.
It seems quite obvious.	Kubonakala kusobala ngokuphelele.
But it sounds great.	Kodwa kuzwakala kakhulu.
And that is not a bad thing at all.	Futhi lokho akuyona into embi ngempela.
As it looks great.	Njengoba kubonakala kakhulu.
You think he can help you.	Ucabanga ukuthi angakwazi ukukusiza.
But that's a lot of money.	Kodwa imali eningi leyo.
You know.	Uyazi .
He does everything well.	Wenza konke kahle.
First, there is no need.	Okokuqala, asikho isidingo.
It could be weeks or months.	Kungaba amasonto noma izinyanga.
I go home every morning.	Ngiya ekhaya ekuseni nsuku zonke.
So he learns as he goes.	Ngakho ufunda njengoba ehamba.
He would not make it easy for you.	Wayengeke akwenze kube lula.
Finally, she returned to him.	Ekugcineni, wabuyela kuye.
That's what he told me to do.	Yilokho angitshele ukuba ngikwenze.
I live with him in college.	Ngihlala naye ekolishi.
I will, of course.	Ngizokwenza, kunjalo.
And I want to know, too.	Futhi ngifisa ukwazi, kanye nami.
Lots of crying.	Ukukhala okuningi.
That is what happened to this.	Yilokho okwenzeka kulokhu.
He will not stop now.	Ngeke ayeke manje.
Nice to talk to you.	Ngiyajabula ukukhuluma nawe.
I did not want to go to prison.	Ngangingafuni ukuya ejele.
It is very difficult to say here.	Kunzima kakhulu ukusho lapha.
He did not want to see this happen.	Wayengafuni ukukubona lokhu kwenzeka.
It happened between you and me.	Kwenzeke phakathi kwami ​​nawe.
But he never went to college.	Kodwa akazange aye ekolishi.
Just like this.	Kanje nje.
And that can be any time.	Futhi lokho kungase kube noma nini.
So it has to be.	Ngakho kufanele kube njalo.
No one should know anything.	Akekho okumele azi lutho.
Now this is when.	Manje lokhu nini.
Only now.	Kuphela manje.
Just because he wanted to.	Ngoba nje wayefuna.
He did not do many.	Akazange enze abaningi.
He should not be beautiful.	Akufanele abe muhle.
Or he did.	Noma ukwenzile.
This has been going on for three weeks.	Lokhu sekuphele amasonto amathathu.
I like to sit up.	Ngithanda ukuhlala phezulu.
Stop one thing.	Yeka into eyodwa.
This is not a gift.	Akusona isipho lesi.
She is a real child.	Uyingane impela.
Something bad happened here last night.	Kwenzeke into embi lapha izolo ebusuku.
It could be for now.	Kungaba okwamanje.
I do not know at all.	Angazi neze.
He told me it was his job.	Wangitshela ukuthi umsebenzi wakhe.
This will be for you, soon.	Lokhu kuzoba nguwe, maduze.
We need to find out what is happening.	Kudingeka sithole ukuthi kwenzakalani.
He just does things.	Wenza izinto nje.
Not just once.	Hhayi nje kanye kanye.
But now that will not happen.	Kodwa manje lokho ngeke kwenzeke.
You've been there long enough.	Ube khona isikhathi eside ngokwanele.
He knows he has to go.	Uyazi ukuthi kufanele ahambe.
That's all there is to do.	Yilokho kuphela okumele kwenziwe.
He wanted to make things right.	Wayefuna ukulungisa izinto.
That is not all true.	Akulona iqiniso lonke.
That's it again.	Yilokho kuphela futhi.
I never thought he could do it.	Angikaze ngicabange ukuthi angakwenza.
But you do not need to take our word for it.	Kodwa awudingi ukuthatha izwi lethu ngakho.
Clearly, he was not.	Kusobala ukuthi wayengekho.
But he would not go there.	Kodwa wayengeke aye lapho.
You will be leaving for a while.	Uzohamba isikhashana.
But I do not know how to do it.	Kodwa angazi kanjani ukwenza kanjalo.
He came home tomorrow.	Ufike ekhaya kusasa.
Not the way you think.	Hhayi indlela ocabanga ngayo.
In all of that.	Kukho konke lokho.
Because I've been looking for you.	Ngoba kade engifuna.
For my work, of course, you too.	Ngomsebenzi wami, kunjalo, nawe.
He knew that had to happen.	Wayazi ukuthi lokho kwakufanele kwenzeke.
I want to know how that sounds.	Ngifuna ukwazi ukuthi kuzwakala kanjani lokho.
I said I was surprised.	Ngathi ngiyamangala.
But we all know that he should be.	Kodwa sonke siyazi ukuthi kufanele abe njalo.
It shouldn't have been.	Bekungafanele kube khona.
Maybe that's all he ever wanted to do.	Mhlawumbe yilokho kuphela ake afuna ukukwenza.
Not true now.	Akulona iqiniso manje.
Everyone knows this, very well.	Wonke umuntu uyakwazi lokhu, kahle kakhulu.
But it is definitely not worth it.	Kodwa nakanjani akufanele.
But it did not have to be today, or tomorrow.	Kodwa kwakungadingeki ukuthi kube namuhla, noma kusasa.
No, he did not know when he would return.	Cha, wayengazi ukuthi uzobuya nini.
We have to do it right.	Kufanele sikwenze kahle.
I need to be better than that.	Ngidinga ukuba ngcono kunalokho.
Not that he would do that either.	Hhayi ukuthi naye uzokwenza lokho.
He did not know there was such a thing.	Wayengazi ukuthi kukhona into enjalo.
But he also got there before me.	Kodwa futhi wafika lapho ngaphambi kwami.
I go every day.	Ngiya zonke izinsuku.
Or maybe wait.	Noma mhlawumbe ukulinda.
I don’t know if I did this the right way.	Angazi noma ngenza lokhu ngendlela efanele.
He didn't know what it was yet.	Wayengazi ukuthi yini okwamanje.
Or rather he said.	Noma kunalokho wathi.
There to see, talk to him.	Lapho ukuze abone, akhulume naye.
Sometimes it's really hard.	Ngezinye izikhathi kunzima ngempela.
It was clear he was.	Kwacaca ukuthi uyena.
I think it will happen.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kuzokwenzeka.
Stop trying to find things.	Yeka ukuzama ukuthola izinto.
Our beautiful cat.	Ikati lethu elihle.
I also know that he did not speak.	Ngiyazi futhi ukuthi akazange akhulume.
I want to eat one.	Ngifuna ukudla eyodwa.
He got one first.	Wathola eyodwa kuqala.
No, not at all.	Cha, impela kuye.
But he found out who she was talking to.	Kodwa wathola ukuthi ukhuluma nobani.
It can happen again at any time.	Kungenzeka futhi noma nini.
Or truth.	Noma iqiniso.
I am the only one.	Mina ngedwa .
She would be beautiful and tall.	Wayezoba muhle futhi mude.
Making a lot of money.	Ukwenza imali eningi.
But he knew that he would never do such a thing.	Kodwa wayazi ukuthi wayengeke enze into enjalo.
Not really, everywhere.	Cha ngempela, yonke indawo.
The problem, he said, was the story.	Inkinga, wathi indaba.
He too could not say anything.	Naye akakwazanga ukusho lutho.
It would be a mistake to do so.	Kungaba iphutha ukwenza lokhu.
He said he would make it happen.	Wathi uzokwenza kwenzeke.
Help him stay.	Amsize ahlale.
Very good case, isn't it.	Icala elihle kakhulu, akunjalo.
He knew right now.	Wayazi khona manje.
Another died later.	Omunye umuntu washona kamuva.
But that is not your worst problem.	Kodwa leyo akuyona inkinga yakho embi kakhulu.
Up in the room.	Phezulu ekamelweni.
He has no other choice.	Akanayo enye indlela.
This is a big deal for me.	Lena into enkulu ngami.
What you want to do first.	Yini ofuna ukuyenza kuqala.
Absolutely, as much as possible.	Ngokuphelele, ngangokunokwenzeka.
Very loud noise.	Umsindo omkhulu kakhulu.
But today.	Kodwa namuhla .
I want my dinner.	Ngifuna isidlo sami sakusihlwa.
But my father is not here.	Kodwa ubaba akekho.
He has only done his job.	Wenze umsebenzi wakhe kuphela.
He couldn't do it with you there.	Akakwazanga ukukwenza nawe lapho.
My father is with him now.	Ubaba ukhona naye manje.
Good health.	Impilo enhle.
I did not know why.	Ngangingazi ukuthi kungani ngempela.
He did not know when he had departed.	Wayengazi ukuthi uhambe nini.
Maybe we both did.	Mhlawumbe sobabili senze kanjalo.
I will be your boy.	Ngizoba umfana wakho.
I am glad we did better in this.	Ngiyajabula ukuthi senze kangcono kulokhu.
Just for me.	Ngami nje.
Or in prison, obviously.	Noma ejele, kusobala.
Eventually, he decided to return to work.	Ekugcineni, wanquma ukubuyela emsebenzini.
That's right, that's very true.	Lokho kunjalo, kuyiqiniso kakhulu.
Please.	Ngicela .
And that's exactly what happened.	Futhi khona lapho kwenzeka.
He is a better person.	Ungumuntu ongcono.
I don't know, he thought.	Angazi, wacabanga.
How to do most of it all.	Indlela yokwenza okuningi kwakho konke.
I need help right away.	Ngifuna usizo ngokushesha.
You know you can't be that.	Uyazi ngeke ube yilokho.
Everyone knew everyone.	Wonke umuntu wayazi wonke umuntu.
This is not life.	Akuyona impilo lena.
He may return at any time.	Angase abuye noma nini.
Unless it's going to be a lot better.	Ngaphandle kokuthi kuzoba ngcono kakhulu.
Certainly I would not know.	Impela bengingeke ngazi.
You made a lot of money.	Wenze imali eningi.
I want to finish.	Ngifuna ukuqeda.
My mother found out about it.	Umama wathola ngakho.
I just know that a lot.	Ngiyazi nje ukuthi kuningi.
And he was able to do it.	Futhi wakwazi ukukwenza.
I say that, too.	Ngisho lokho, futhi.
It is not something completely new.	Akuyona into entsha ngokuphelele.
He must be our best friend.	Kumelwe abe umngane wethu omkhulu.
So nothing really.	Ngakho akukho lutho ngempela.
I'm sure you know.	Ngiqinisekile uyazi.
He can speak.	Uyakwazi ukukhuluma.
Not for me, though.	Hhayi kimi, noma kunjalo.
Not just one thing.	Hhayi nje into eyodwa.
Probably because it would be a big job.	Mhlawumbe ngoba kungaba umsebenzi omkhulu.
Now it seems like it could possibly happen.	Manje kubonakala sengathi kungenzeka ukuthi kungenzeka.
Not really me.	Akumina ngempela.
The work is excellent.	Umsebenzi muhle kakhulu.
Very good time.	Isikhathi esihle impela.
You should tell me that.	Kufanele ungitshele kanjalo.
You can also travel over time.	Ungakwazi futhi ukuhamba isikhathi.
Making the choice easier.	Ukwenza ukukhetha kube lula.
She was beautiful.	Waba muhle.
He will not do anything.	Ngeke enze noma yini.
Too much thinking.	Ukucabanga kakhulu.
He never left.	Akakaze ahambe.
But in such a place.	Kodwa endaweni enjalo.
You should eat with me.	Kufanele udle nawe.
I have never known such a thing.	Angikaze ngazi into enjalo.
It just had to be.	Kwakufanele nje kube njalo.
He asked me everything.	Wangibuza ngakho konke.
Looking for an opportunity.	Ofuna ithuba.
I should know better now.	Kufanele ngazi kangcono manje.
I don't have a dog.	Anginayo inja.
This way it will be good for both of us.	Ngale ndlela kuzoba kuhle kithi sobabili.
And not just in class.	Futhi hhayi nje ekilasini.
He is not alone here.	Akekho yedwa lapha.
How he came to be in the end.	Ube khona kanjani ekugcineni.
Where he goes.	Lapho eya khona.
And it's better.	Futhi kungcono.
At least not then.	Okungenani hhayi ngaleso sikhathi.
He may stop.	Angase ayeke.
Not everyone, of course.	Akuwona wonke umuntu, kunjalo.
That one needs a certain job.	Lowo udinga umsebenzi othile.
Yes but for how long.	Yebo kodwa kuze kube nini.
Maybe a car is a really good thing.	Mhlawumbe imoto into enhle ngempela.
At first it is better.	Ekuqaleni kungcono.
We too.	Nathi futhi.
He should have done that three years ago.	Bekufanele akwenze lokho eminyakeni emithathu edlule.
I'm not sure how.	Angazi kahle kanjani.
All of this and all of mine.	Konke lokhu nakho konke kwami.
And it is better to do it right.	Futhi kungcono akwenze kahle.
I have thought many times.	Ngiye ngacabanga kaningi.
All you have to do is find out why.	Okufanele ukwenze ukuthola ukuthi kungani.
No I am surprised.	Hhayi mina ngiyamangala.
I really want to know.	Ngifisa ukwazi ngempela.
He did not do so either.	Naye akazange enze njalo.
I wish there was.	Ngifisa sengathi ngabe kukhona.
That is what happened.	Yilokho okwenzekile.
That is probably true right now.	Cishe lokho kuyiqiniso njengamanje.
He has been very helpful to me.	Ube usizo kakhulu kimi.
Except maybe this one.	Ngaphandle mhlawumbe lena.
But still, he should have told me.	Kodwa noma kunjalo, bekufanele angitshele.
I don't see, still.	Angiboni, namanje.
Or it may be earlier now.	Noma kungenzeka kube ngaphambili manje.
My mother did.	Umama wenza njalo.
I saw the room.	Ngabona igumbi.
Sometimes, months or years.	Ngezinye izikhathi, izinyanga noma iminyaka.
No, he just said a nice dress.	Cha, uthe nje ingubo enhle.
The City loves money.	UMuzi uthanda imali.
I saw the same thing.	Ngabona into efanayo.
You need to do something.	Udinga ukwenza okuthile.
I hope that happens soon.	Ngethemba ukuthi lokho kwenzeka maduze nje.
Tomorrow you will do better.	Kusasa uzokwenza kangcono.
He wanted his clothes.	Wayefuna izingubo zakhe.
It happened to me the same way.	Kwenzeke kimi ngendlela efanayo.
It can be very difficult at least.	Kungaba nzima kakhulu okungenani.
No drinking, at work or at work.	Akukho ukuphuza, emsebenzini noma emsebenzini.
And you too.	Futhi wena naye.
And he started working.	Futhi waqala ukusebenza.
We do better here.	Senza kangcono lapha.
I wanted to say that.	Bengifuna ukusho lokho.
I couldn't really say anything.	Angikwazanga ngempela ukusho lutho.
It could just be me.	Kungase kube yimina nje.
He says it's okay.	Uthi kulungile.
That's right, that's fine.	Kunjalo nje, kuhle.
He got into trouble immediately.	Wangena enkingeni ngokushesha.
No one thinks it is true.	Akekho ocabanga ukuthi kuyiqiniso.
But you are definitely capable.	Kodwa nakanjani unekhono.
I should have thought about that.	Bekufanele ngicabange ngalokho.
Maybe you just want to travel to the big city.	Mhlawumbe ufuna nje ukuhamba edolobheni elikhulu.
You can definitely do it at home.	Ungakwazi nakanjani ukwenze ekhaya.
You're sitting, you're sitting.	Uhlezi, uhlezi.
That maybe my parents.	Ukuthi mhlawumbe abazali bami .
Really bad, too.	Omubi ngempela, futhi.
Everyone told me.	Wonke umuntu wangitshela.
So, yes, where are you going.	Ngakho, yebo, lapho uya khona.
Maybe that's why he came.	Mhlawumbe yingakho eze.
I need hope.	Ngidinga ithemba .
Hopefully I will do so this summer.	Ngethemba ukuthi ngizokwenza kanjalo ehlobo.
Or maybe something completely different.	Noma mhlawumbe enye into ngokuphelele.
So today we will not do it.	Ngakho namuhla ngeke sikwenze.
I didn't have to tell anyone.	Kwakungadingeki ngitshele muntu.
Well these are there.	Kahle lezi lapho.
He never did.	Akakaze akwenze.
He rarely makes a bad decision.	Akavamile ukwenza isinqumo esibi.
I mean, yes, that's right.	Ngisho, yebo, kunjalo.
It is not always easy to be busy.	Akukhona neze ukuba matasa ngaso sonke isikhathi.
We all know about this.	Sonke siyazi ngalokhu.
So far so good !.	Kuze kube manje kuhle kakhulu!.
And, let me repeat.	Futhi, ngivumele ngiphinde.
You will be able to speak on your own.	Uzokwazi ukukhuluma wedwa.
He goes there again.	Aphinde lapho aphinde ahambe futhi.
You know that you have a choice.	Uyazi ukuthi kukhona ukukhetha okufanele ukwenze.
I hope you made the right choice.	Ngethemba ukuthi wenze ukukhetha okufanele.
Now you want one.	Manje ufuna eyodwa.
Even he himself has spoken of it.	Ngisho naye uke akhulume ngayo.
But that is not true of me right now.	Kodwa lokho akulona iqiniso lami njengamanje.
You want someone in between.	Ufuna umuntu phakathi.
He agreed and left.	Wavuma wahamba.
I am a newcomer.	Yimina omusha lo.
I need to go home to our home.	Ngidinga ukuya ekhaya ekhaya lethu.
He may be with her then.	Angase abe naye ngaleso sikhathi.
This can also be very helpful.	Lokhu kungase futhi kube usizo kakhulu.
I wish you hadn’t.	Ngifisa sengathi awuzange.
I apologize for what happened.	Ngiyaxolisa lokhu okwenzekile.
I asked my mother.	Ngabuza umama.
I can't say much.	Angikwazi ukusho okuningi.
But he did a few things.	Kodwa wenza izinto ezimbalwa.
You want a name.	Ufuna igama.
Not his friends.	Hhayi abangani bakhe.
I want more on this.	Ngifuna okwengeziwe kulokhu.
That happens all the time.	Lokho kwenzeka ngaso sonke isikhathi.
He should never know.	Akumele neze azi.
You have to go to work tomorrow.	Kuzomele uye emsebenzini kusasa.
I feel it now.	Ngizwe manje.
I feel that way in the morning.	Ngizizwa kanjalo ekuseni.
But not fast enough.	Kodwa hhayi ngokushesha ngokwanele.
I said thank you.	Bengithi ngiyabonga.
I just need time alone.	Ngidinga nje isikhathi ngedwa.
When you do this, a few things happen.	Uma wenza lokhu, kwenzeka izinto ezimbalwa.
Not just me but him too.	Hhayi nami kuphela kodwa naye.
Lots of people too.	Abantu abaningi futhi.
Money is not everything.	Imali akuyona yonke into.
He did not really know how he felt.	Wayengazi ngempela ukuthi uzizwa kanjani.
I can't read his mind on that.	Angikwazi ukufunda umqondo wakhe ngalokho.
Just doing the job.	Ukwenza nje umsebenzi.
But anything! 	Kodwa noma yini!
I really think that.	Ngicabanga lokho ngempela.
This should be the case.	Kufanele kube lokhu.
Maybe one.	Mhlawumbe eyodwa.
Someone had to know.	Kwakufanele omunye umuntu azi.
I think about it.	Ngike ngicabange ngakho.
This should be easy for us.	Lokhu kufanele kube lula kithi.
So he came.	Ngakho wafika.
Yesterday, if possible.	Izolo, uma kungenzeka.
In making it better.	Ekwenzeni kube ngcono.
Why that happened.	Kungani lokho kwenzeka.
I thought of drinking.	Ngacabanga ukuphuza.
Everything is too good to be true.	Konke kuhle kakhulu ukuba kuhle.
That's a very good reason.	Leso isizathu esihle kakhulu.
He went in everywhere.	Wangena yonke indawo.
He slowly refused.	Wenqaba kancane kancane.
He can have it all.	Angaba nakho konke.

Error there.	Iphutha lapho.
Clothes? 	Ingubo?

He has a lot to tell you.	Kuningi afuna ukukutshela kona.
He did not go.	Akazange aye.
But it always happens.	Kodwa kwenzeka ngaso sonke isikhathi.

That is why the marriage began.	Yingakho umshado waqala.
Need, of course, reason.	Isidingo, kunjalo, isizathu.
It seems like a lot of hard work for me to try.	Kubonakala sengathi ukusebenza kanzima kimi ukuzama.
Dad organizes one every year.	Ubaba uhlela eyodwa njalo ngonyaka.
Maybe he would be hard.	Mhlawumbe wayezoba nzima.

So in the office, there all morning.	Ngakho ehhovisi, lapho ekuseni yonke.
This is not true, either.	Lokhu akulona iqiniso, futhi.

It is best if the whole family reads the plan.	Kungcono uma wonke umndeni ufunda uhlelo.
He may not be able to get out.	Angase angakwazi ukuphuma.
I have reconsidered.	Ngike ngacabanga kabusha.

Nice to see you, of course.	Kuhle ukukubona, kunjalo.
He thought the doctor was his father.	Wayecabanga ukuthi udokotela ubaba wakhe.
I'm happy for you, you know.	Ngijabule ngawe, uyazi.
Everyone should go to work.	Wonke umuntu kufanele aye emsebenzini.
You know when it sounds right.	Uyazi uma kuzwakala kulungile.
Everything has been very simple.	Konke kube lula kakhulu.
I will do anything, anything.	Ngizokwenza noma yini, noma yini.
I do not know.	Cha angazi.
He speaks for a long time.	Ukhuluma isikhathi eside.
I'm not sure you're human.	Angiqiniseki ukuthi ungumuntu.
He cannot live alone.	Akakwazi ukuphila yedwa.
He thought of sleeping for three hours.	Wacabanga ukulala amahora amathathu.
She wanted to cry at night.	Wayefuna ukukhala ebusuku.
He wants to spend time with us.	Ufuna ukuchitha isikhathi nathi.
What a name.	Yini igama.
He looked up a little.	Wabheka kancane.
Even if you have thought about it.	Noma ngabe uke wacabanga ngakho.
This is nothing new to him.	Lokhu akuyona into entsha kuye.
This is ultimately a problem.	Lokhu ekugcineni inkinga.
And at night.	Futhi ebusuku.
You should not be happy.	Akumele ujabule.
I know what happened to me.	Ngiyazi ukuthi kwenzekani kimi.
But right there.	Kodwa khona lapho.
So you do not need to fix anything at all.	Ngakho awudingi ukulungisa lutho nhlobo.
All of this is done by you.	Konke lokhu kwenziwe nguwe.
All great.	Konke okukhulu.
But that does not have to happen.	Kodwa lokho akudingekile ukuba kwenzeke.
I said he would go alone.	Bengithi uzohamba sodwa.
Here and there, everywhere.	Lapha lapho, yonke indawo.
If you need to go, you need to go.	Uma udinga ukuhamba, udinga ukuhamba.
I wanted to drink too much.	Ngangifuna ukuphuza kakhulu.
I need to stop.	Ngidinga ukuyeka.
This will probably not happen soon.	Lokhu cishe ngeke kwenzeke maduze.
I wanted to do it too.	Nami ngangifuna ukukwenza.
I got the idea early.	Ngithole umqondo kusenesikhathi.
He left for a while.	Wahamba isikhashana.
At that time, he knew many things.	Ngaleso sikhathi, wayazi izinto eziningi.
We should do the same.	Kufanele nathi sikwenze lokho nathi.
But the choice, the choice is there.	Kodwa ukukhetha, ukukhetha kukhona.
He seemed to be going well.	Wayebonakala ehamba kahle.
And you, well.	Futhi wena, kahle.
They said that it was wrong.	Bathi lokho bekungafanele.
By this time, he knew everything about her.	Ngalesi sikhathi, wayazi konke ngaye.
Or you can't.	Noma awukwazi.
And so it could be your fault.	Futhi ngakho kungaba iphutha lakho.
I have to know what happened.	Kumele ngazi ukuthi kwenzekeni.
Nothing at all, and all that.	Akukho nhlobo, nakho konke lokho.
It's hard enough for that to happen.	Kunzima ngokwanele ukuthi lokho kwenzeke.
And he wanted to go.	Futhi wayefuna ukuhamba.
But you can't do it.	Kodwa awukwazi ukukwenza.
You just never know.	Awukaze nje wazi.
Not in the room, but in him.	Hhayi ekamelweni, kodwa kuye.
I will not do such a thing here.	Ngeke ngenze into enjalo lapha.
New family.	Umndeni omusha.
I found some right here.	Ngithole ezinye khona lapha.
He will be back in the night.	Uzobuya ebusuku.
But just a plan.	Kodwa icebo nje.
I found one right away.	Ngithole eyodwa ngaso leso sikhathi.
But, this.	Kodwa, lokhu.
You know, that's not my job.	Uyazi, akuwona umsebenzi wami lowo.
There is no such thing.	Ayikho nje into enjalo.
He really felt it.	Wazizwa ngempela .
That's the fix.	Lokho ukulungisa.
He recognized my name.	Waqaphela igama lami.
Still in a bad way.	Namanje ngendlela embi.
I think there is nothing wrong with it.	Ngicabanga ukuthi akukho okubi kukho.
That will not happen now.	Lokho ngeke kwenzeke manje.
I did not want to come.	Ngangingafuni ukuza.
I would just like to see.	Ngingathanda nje ukubona.
Not helpful.	Hhayi usizo.
I'm not sure what to think about.	Angiqiniseki ukuthi yini okumele ngicabange ngayo.
I didn't want to go either.	Nami ngangingafuni ukuhamba.
Not entirely, of course.	Hhayi ngokuphelele, kunjalo.
I need this.	Ngidinga lena.
I need my sleep.	Ngidinga ukulala kwami.
He was surprised with her.	Wamangala naye.
And you can't do that unless you do it.	Futhi awukwazi ukwenza lokho ngaphandle kokuthi ukwenze.
Very good, perhaps.	Kuhle kakhulu, mhlawumbe.
He did not even know if he could walk.	Wayengazi nokuthi angakwazi yini ukuhamba.
I mean, just think about it.	Ngisho, ake ucabange ngakho.
He never talked about it.	Akakaze akhulume ngayo.
Maybe he went into the house looking for something else.	Mhlawumbe wangena endlini efuna okunye.
We've done things together, exactly.	Senze izinto ndawonye, ​​impela.
I just wanted time.	Ngangifuna isikhathi nje.
Yes, all of this is possible.	Yebo, konke lokhu kungenzeka.
There is no .	Akekho .

But he did not try.	Kodwa akazange azame.
She seemed happy with him.	Wabonakala ejabule naye.
Not always, of course.	Akunjalo ngaso sonke isikhathi, kunjalo.
Finally, Dad opened his eyes.	Ekugcineni, ubaba wavula amehlo akhe.
You are not.	Nawe awuyena.
Maybe that could happen to me.	Mhlawumbe lokho kungenzeka kimi.
But why did you do that ?.	Kodwa kungani wenze lokho?.

I would like to hear.	Ngifisa ukuzwa.
Times, and you should.	Izikhathi, futhi kufanele.
And he didn't want to try.	Futhi wayengafuni ukuzama.
He did not eat breakfast in the morning.	Akazange adle isidlo sasekuseni ekuseni.
But he did not speak again immediately.	Kodwa akazange aphinde akhulume ngokushesha.
I have to talk to him now '.	Kuzomele ngikhulume naye manje'.
It's useless.	Akulona usizo.
Your room.	Igumbi lakho.
Not just his death but your whole death.	Hhayi nje ukufa kwakhe kodwa ukufa kwakho konke.
I don't know what to do now.	Angazi ngenzeni manje.
His spirit went out.	Umoya wakhe waphuma.
Something has to be done.	Kufanele kwenziwe okuthile.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Ayikho into engalungile kakhulu.
So stop wasting your time with me.	Ngakho yeka ukuchitha isikhathi sakho ngami.
But you can if you like.	Kodwa ungakwazi uma uthanda.
Or, better, over here.	Noma, kungcono, ngale.

Not always true, but most of the time, it is.	Akulona iqiniso ngaso sonke isikhathi, kodwa isikhathi esiningi, kunjalo.
I'm not sure that could be that.	Angiqiniseki ukuthi kungaba yini lokho.
I did it all.	Ngikwenze konke.
I mean, he just wouldn't stop.	Ngisho, ubengeke nje ayeke.
There is nothing to be done about it, of course.	Akukho okumele kwenziwe ngakho, kunjalo.
I could not think of anyone but myself.	Ngangingacabangi muntu ngaphandle kwami.
But that will not be the case.	Kodwa lokho ngeke kube.
He did, actually.	Wenza, empeleni.
I should have known he was coming.	Kumele ngabe ngazi ukuthi uyeza.
All my life he seemed like that to me.	Ukuphila kwami ​​konke wayebonakala kanjalo kimi.
We had a really bad time.	Sibe nesikhathi esibi ngempela.
I would love to be.	Ngingathanda ukuba.

I'm sure he'll be right back.	Nginesiqiniseko sokuthi uzobuya khona manje.
I want so many things.	Ngifuna izinto eziningi kakhulu.
He was just alone.	Wavele waba yedwa.
At least it is very difficult.	Okungenani kunzima kakhulu.
Obviously, if you think about it.	Kusobala, uma ucabanga ngakho.
Now you know everything.	Manje wazi konke.
But not in the way he said.	Kodwa hhayi ngendlela asho ngayo.
And playing at home.	Futhi ukudlala ekhaya.

But every morning.	Kodwa njalo ekuseni.
And now, just once.	Futhi manje, kanye nje.

Every now and then, one went back to the room.	Njalo, omunye wabuyela ekamelweni.
Man does not have it, or does not have it at all.	Umuntu akanalo, noma akanalo nhlobo.
All the way in between.	Indlela yonke phakathi.
And there is no way.	Futhi ayikho indlela.

Before one arrives first.	Ngaphambi kokuthi umuntu afike kuqala.
And to stay longer.	Futhi ukuhlala isikhathi eside.
He is coming, and he will be here tomorrow.	Uyeza, abe lapha kusasa.
He will not think of things first.	Ngeke acabange izinto kuqala.
And it will be me.	Futhi kuzoba yimina.
But great danger, too.	Kodwa ingozi enkulu, futhi.
Tell me first about yourself.	Ngitshele kuqala ngawe.

He knew he was doing the best he could.	Wayazi ukuthi wenza konke okusemandleni akhe.
And boy is it always true.	Futhi umfana kuyiqiniso njalo.

We have done well so far.	Senze kahle kuze kube manje.
I didn’t want to be something else.	Ngangingafuni ukuba enye into.
But in this case, that is not true.	Kodwa kulokhu, lokho akulona iqiniso.
That is not his story.	Akuyona indaba yakhe.
Or it should not be.	Noma akufanele kube njalo.
Homework.	Umsebenzi wesikole.
And he speaks almost every day.	Futhi ukhuluma cishe nsuku zonke.
I think everyone knows.	Ngicabanga ukuthi wonke umuntu uyazi.
I hope that is true for all of us.	Ngethemba ukuthi lokho kuyiqiniso kithi sonke.

Yes, that seems too good to be true.	Yebo, lokho kubonakala kungcono kakhulu.
I just didn't know it was going to take that long.	Bengingazi nje ukuthi kuzothatha isikhathi eside kangaka.

Great question !.	Umbuzo omkhulu!.
And my family stayed with me.	Futhi umndeni wami wahlala nami.
I want him to stop talking.	Ngifuna ayeke ukukhuluma.
He really wants to talk to you.	Ufuna ngempela ukukhuluma nawe.

And he was not sure about her.	Futhi wayengenaso isiqiniseko ngaye.
But you know that you really should eat.	Kodwa uyazi ukuthi kufanele udle ngempela.
Tell everyone the truth.	Tshela wonke umuntu iqiniso.
It could be better this way.	Kungaba ngcono ngale ndlela.
At least, it should be.	Okungenani, kufanele kube.

That is why we need your help.	Yingakho sidinga usizo lwakho.
So do you.	Usho kanjalo nawe.

And as you say.	Futhi njengoba usho.
We really shouldn’t have gone.	Bekungafanele sihambe ngempela.
He is her only hope.	Uyena kuphela ithemba lakhe.
Meanwhile, he did not.	Okwamanje, akazange.
I'm so glad you're coming.	Ngijabule kakhulu ukuthi uyeza.
No, he is not with me.	Cha, akekho nami.
Or he did.	Noma wakwenza.
Really, I want to do that again.	Ngempela, ngifuna ukwenza lokho futhi.
It only happens a few times.	Kwenzeka izikhathi ezimbalwa kuphela.
He told me what had happened.	Wangitshela ukuthi kwenzekeni.
And that, obviously, is good.	Futhi lokho, ngokusobala, kuhle.
He is, now.	Ukhona, manje.
He was not sure if it was true.	Wayengenaso isiqiniseko sokuthi kuyiqiniso yini.
He did not want to say what he did.	Wayengafuni ukusho ukuthi wenzeni.
Let me do it.	Ake ngikwenze.
Mistakes definitely.	Amaphutha nakanjani.
This would be a lie.	Lokhu kuzoba amanga.
It's hard now you know.	Kunzima manje uyazi.
He did it because he wanted to.	Wakwenza ngoba efuna.
I thought about him a lot.	Ngacabanga ngaye kakhulu.
You really want to talk about me.	Uyafuna ngempela ukukhuluma ngami.
But now! 	Kodwa manje!
His family.	Umndeni wakhe.
I came here for you.	Ngize lapha ngenxa yakho.
We want you to stay at work.	Sifuna uhlale emsebenzini.
He could not have done better himself.	Wayengeke enze kangcono yena.
You think we want to be this way.	Ucabanga ukuthi sifuna ukuba ngale ndlela.
He hoped he would arrive on time.	Wayenethemba lokuthi uzofika ngesikhathi.
So don’t be hard.	Ngakho ungabi nzima.
And that's the danger.	Futhi ingozi leyo.
But you too.	Kodwa nawe.
Unless you do.	Ngaphandle uma wenza.
How it works for you.	Usebenza kanjani ngawe.
I want to go to the park.	Ngifuna ukuya epaki.
Not your father, of course.	Hhayi ubaba wakho, kusobala.
He could not do this to me.	Akakwazanga ukwenza lokhu kimi.
I'm not sure that's true.	Angiqiniseki ukuthi lokho kuyiqiniso.
He is, he is the only one.	Nguye, nguye yedwa.
Right now, that's not true.	Njengamanje, akulona iqiniso.
I know you don't want to do it this way.	Ngiyazi ukuthi awufuni ukwenza ngale ndlela.
Yes he was.	Yebo wayesaba.
He said he wanted to go to school.	Uthe ufuna ukuya esikoleni.
And something had to be done about it.	Futhi kwakudingeka kwenziwe okuthile ngakho.
He looked ugly, really ugly.	Wayebukeka embi, embi ngempela.
I want all his money.	Ngifuna yonke imali yakhe.
He has to think things through.	Kufanele acabange kahle izinto.
French though.	IsiFulentshi kunjalo.
This could be.	Lokhu kungaba.
Then to him.	Khona kuye.
Please reconsider.	Ngicela ucabange kabusha.
I really did.	Ngempela ngenze kanjalo.
Everyone reads this in the end.	Wonke umuntu ufunda lokhu ekugcineni.
You had a great time today.	Wenze isikhathi esihle namuhla.
I need to tell you what to do.	Ngidinga ukukutshela okufanele kwenziwe.
Many times, though.	Izikhathi eziningi, noma kunjalo.
Maybe in the same way.	Mhlawumbe ngendlela efanayo.
I wanted to buy a new house.	Bengifuna ukuthenga indlu entsha.
I want more time there.	Ngifuna isikhathi esiningi lapho.
You think everyone is just like you.	Ucabanga ukuthi wonke umuntu ufana nawe.
You make mistakes.	Wenza amaphutha.
But he's a good boy.	Kodwa ungumfana omuhle.
But it can be difficult.	Kodwa kungase kube nzima.
I always think about it and think about it.	Ngihlale ngicabanga ngakho futhi ngicabanga ngakho.
And he just didn't.	Futhi akazange nje.
Because it is, indeed.	Ngoba kunjalo, ngempela.
It seems to me that this is the case.	Kubonakala kimi ukuthi lokhu kunjalo.
It did not take long.	Akuzange kube isikhathi eside.
I'm not sure what to do here.	Angiqiniseki ukuthi ngenzeni lapha.
Waiting for something.	Ukulinda okuthile.
He doesn't want to say anything else.	Akafuni ukusho okunye.
He went, and he should.	Wahamba, futhi kufanele.
The best so far.	Kungcono kakhulu kuze kube manje.
Hopefully, that tomorrow.	Ngethemba, lokho kusasa.
He wasn't sure he was.	Wayengenaso isiqiniseko sokuthi nguye.
But you do not have to stay.	Kodwa akudingeki uhlale.
There are a few things in place here.	Kukhona izinto ezimbalwa endaweni lapha.
I just wanted to play.	Bengifuna ukudlala nje.
So that you can move on.	Ukuze ukwazi ukuqhubeka.
He can't drink enough.	Akakwazi ukuphuza ngokwanele.
I can't believe it either!	Nami angikholwa!.
Nothing is done about it again.	Akukho okwenziwa ngakho futhi.
Not these.	Hhayi lezi.
He will do nothing here.	Angeke enze lutho lapha.
Sleeping next to me.	Ukulala eduze kwami.
I'm glad to keep trying.	Ngiyajabula ukuqhubeka ngizama.
He is really talented.	Unekhono ngempela.
I will do it before you.	Ngizokwenza ngaphambi kwakho.
John took an afternoon off from work.	UJohn wathatha ntambama emsebenzini.
My father knew everything.	Ubaba wayazi yonke into.
He just can't be.	Angeke nje abe .
I would like to have dinner at your house.	Ngingathanda ukudla isidlo sakusihlwa endlini yakho.
I'm just trying to help you.	Ngizama nje ukukusiza.
One has to do something.	Kufanele umuntu enze okuthile.
A completely new job.	Umsebenzi omusha ngokuphelele.
He felt that there was no one else in it.	Wezwa ukuthi akekho omunye phakathi.
I hope you are eating right.	Ngethemba ukuthi udla ngendlela efanele.
Such.	Enjalo.
Apparently a person.	Ngokusobala umuntu.
Really nice thing.	Into enhle impela.
And it's not just one.	Futhi akuyona nje eyodwa.
That would be a lot of money.	Lokho kungaba imali eningi kakhulu.
You wouldn't do it anyway.	Ubungeke ukwenze noma kunjalo.
It can be hard to do the job.	Kungaba nzima ukwenza umsebenzi.
I don't know why you went.	Angazi ukuthi uhambe ngani.
Well, so far very good.	Kuhle, kuze kube manje kuhle kakhulu.
Not tomorrow night, but soon.	Hhayi kusasa ebusuku, kodwa maduze.
I'm sorry, but it 's true.	Ngiyaxolisa, kodwa kuyiqiniso.
If you only knew how.	Ukube wazi kanjani.
At least he had to try.	Okungenani kwadingeka azame.
More, more.	Okuningi, okukhulu kakhulu.
The best thing about this place is the restaurant.	Into engcono kakhulu ngale ndawo indawo yokudlela.
I don't know why, but you know.	Angazi ukuthi kungani, kodwa uyazi.
And we all know why.	Futhi sonke siyazi ukuthi kungani.
But it is not just there.	Kodwa akukho nje lapho.
You should go to him now.	Kufanele uye kuye manje.
Tell me where you are.	Ngitshele lapho ukhona.
So he decided to go.	Ngakho, wanquma ukuhamba.
Or it could happen with it.	Noma kungenzeka ngayo.
Not you.	Akekho wena.
Our mother knew about it.	Umama wethu wayazi ngakho.
Maybe you can't.	Mhlawumbe awukwazi.
He or she would like your help in this regard, if possible.	Angathanda usizo lwakho kulokhu, uma kungenzeka.
He also tries to stay.	Aphinde azame ukuhlala.
The vision goes like this.	Umbono uhamba kanje.
He was not both.	Wayengekho nobabili.
Just a nice bike.	Ibhayisikili elihle nje.
Please make sense.	Ngicela wenze umqondo.
It will not be so.	Ngeke ube njalo .
I fear everyone in my work.	Ngesaba wonke umuntu emsebenzini wami.
There is almost nothing there.	Cishe akukho lutho lapho.
They say that this is happening.	Bathi kwenzeka lokhu.
He made this happen.	Wenza lokhu kwenzeke.
We walked a bit here.	Sihambe kancane lapha.
A few things actually.	Izinto ezimbalwa empeleni.
This can be huge.	Lokhu kungaba enkulu.
So he.	Ngakho yena.
He thought really hard.	Wacabanga kanzima impela.
I can't help that right now.	Ngeke ngikwazi ukusiza lokho njengamanje.
He stayed for three weeks.	Wahlala amasonto amathathu.
Everyone thinks so.	Wonke umuntu ucabanga lokho.
I would like to learn to adjust my mood.	Ngingathanda ukufunda ukulungisa umoya wami.
That a lot is fine, though.	Lokho okuningi kulungile, noma kunjalo.
Do not do it again.	Ungakwenzi futhi.
That would be your opinion that's okay.	Lokho kungaba umbono wakho lokho kulungile.
He became so now.	Waba njalo manje.
Looks like it too.	Kubukeka sengathi futhi.
And so he asked.	Futhi ngakho wabuza.
There is a way here.	Kukhona indlela lapha.
What people are talking about.	Lokho abantu ukukhuluma ngakho.
I found out a lot.	Ngithole okuningi.
That's what it is now.	Yinto manje leyo.
Just kids, really.	Izingane nje, ngempela.
The police will do nothing.	Amaphoyisa ngeke enze lutho.
It is not a bad thing or a good thing.	Akuyona into embi noma into enhle.
You just did it to make my job harder.	Ukwenze nje ukwenza umsebenzi wami ube nzima.
I would love to work with you !.	Ngingathanda ukusebenza nawe!.
Not so much in the room.	Hhayi kakhulu ekamelweni.
Not immediately, though.	Hhayi ngokushesha, noma kunjalo.
But he didn't want to talk to me.	Kodwa wayengafuni ukukhuluma nami.
Just a name.	Igama nje.
He could not find the story.	Akakwazanga ukuthola indaba.
He told me his name.	Wangitshela igama lakhe.
Anyone again.	Noma ubani futhi.
Nothing is done to us.	Akukho okwenziwa kithi.
He did not try to do that.	Akazange azame ukwenza kanjalo.
What happened to me means nothing.	Okwenzeka kimi akusho lutho.
He did not and could not.	Akazange futhi akakwazi.
It's not my idea.	Akuwona umqondo wami.
I wanted a day with you.	Bengifuna usuku nawe.
At that moment he knew he was going to leave.	Ngaleso sikhathi wayazi ukuthi uzohamba.
His shoes, too.	Izicathulo zakhe, futhi.
He did not want anyone in the house.	Wayengafuni muntu endlini.
Or very good at it.	Noma kuhle kakhulu kukho.
Another name.	Elinye igama.
It should not be there at night.	Akufanele kube khona lapho ebusuku.
He spoke up.	Wakhuluma ekhuluma.
I want to talk.	Ngifuna ukukhuluma.
Sounds like it will happen soon.	Kuzwakala kuzokwenzeka maduze.
In a month you will not be able to walk.	Ngenyanga ngeke ukwazi ukuhamba.
There is simply no reason why he should be present.	Asikho nje isizathu sokuthi kungani kufanele abe khona.
Not that you will win.	Hhayi ukuthi uzowina.
My friend told me her name.	Umngane wami wangitshela igama lakhe.
Not really.	Akukho ngempela.
I could not be a father.	Angikwazanga ukuba ubaba.
However, this is by no means a problem.	Noma kunjalo, lokhu akuyona neze inkinga.
At least you have.	Okungenani uke waba .
And we will not do it here.	Futhi ngeke sikwenze lapha.
When you do that work.	Lapho wenza lowo msebenzi.
I'm so glad to hear that.	Ngijabule kakhulu ukuzwa lokho.
It is not your decision.	Akusona isinqumo sakho.
Since then, not so much.	Kusukela lapho, hhayi kakhulu.
Or a house.	Noma indlu.
Slowly, yes.	Kancane kancane, yebo.
Slowly, but not really.	Kancane, kodwa hhayi ngempela.
But he came in.	Kodwa wangena.
That is probably not a bad idea.	Lokho cishe akuwona umqondo omubi.
She is well dressed, too.	Ugqoke kahle, futhi.
It is only necessary to stay.	Kudingeka ukuhlala kuphela.
There is another next year.	Kukhona omunye ngonyaka ozayo.
But that is not the question.	Kodwa lowo akuwona umbuzo.
It will be a wonderful time.	Kuzoba isikhathi esihle kakhulu.
This is not just an accident.	Lokhu akuyona nje ingozi.
I had to be with you again.	Kwadingeka ngibe nawe futhi.
He had high hopes that he was not at work.	Wayenethemba elikhulu lokuthi wayengekho emsebenzini.
Church if possible.	Isonto uma kungenzeka.
A friend immediately went with him.	Umngane wahamba naye ngokushesha.
But he should not do that.	Kodwa akufanele akwenze lokho.
He is going in a very bad way.	Uhamba ngendlela embi kabi.
Still, no one is there.	Noma kunjalo, akukho muntu lapho.
I just want to see my son.	Ngifuna nje ukubona indodana yami.
The best thing for you.	Into engcono kakhulu kuwe.
There will be no help.	Ngeke kube khona usizo.
Now, that is not entirely true.	Manje, lokho akulona iqiniso ngokuphelele.
What a fool I am.	Yeka isilima sami.
You go to him.	Uya kuye.
But that can be a problem.	Kodwa lokho kungase kube inkinga.
Really great story.	Indaba enkulu ngempela.
Sometimes you just have to get something.	Ngezinye izikhathi kungase kudingeke uthole okuthile.
But you do not really know what is wrong.	Kodwa awukwazi ngempela ukuthi yini engalungile.
This is a place.	Lena indawo.
One does not think about it.	Umuntu akacabangi ngakho.
Only, he did not appear.	Kuphela, akazange abonakale.
I never knew yet.	Angikaze ngazi okwamanje.
He said he wanted to live.	Uthe ufuna ukuphila.
Not too much travel.	Hhayi ukuhamba kakhulu.
I am very happy with everything.	Ngijabule kakhulu ngakho konke.
You obviously want to see it.	Kusobala ukuthi uyafuna ukukubona.
He wants it all.	Ufuna konke.
Everyone heard things.	Wonke umuntu wezwa izinto.
Everyone wanted to get out and go home.	Wonke umuntu wayefuna ukuphuma aye ekhaya.
I did not want to think about this.	Ngangingafuni ukucabanga ngalokhu.
Not that.	Hhayi lokho .
It has to be a big fix.	Kufanele kube ukulungisa okukhulu.
At least, he thought it was her.	Okungenani, wayecabanga ukuthi nguye.
Or trying to be, at least.	Noma uzama ukuba, okungenani.
Yes all that is good.	Yebo konke lokho kuhle.
That's not my problem yet.	Akuyona inkinga yami leyo okwamanje.
He did not, but only.	Akazange, kodwa kuphela.
He lives across.	Uhlala ngale.
You knew nothing.	Ubungazi lutho.
But in the end there is money.	Kodwa ekugcineni kukhona imali.
If you don't do that that's fine too.	Uma ungakwenzi lokho kulungile futhi.
I think that sounds good.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kuzwakala kulungile.
But in the end, he had to leave.	Kodwa ekugcineni, kwadingeka ahambe.
It could be a mistake.	Kungenzeka iphutha.
We can not do without your help.	Asikwazi ngaphandle kosizo lwakho.
I'm not sure what his problem is.	Angazi kahle ukuthi yini inkinga yakhe.
What a wonderful church !.	Yeka isonto elihle!.
He was not that person.	Wayengeyena lowo muntu.
Really, really he didn’t.	Ngempela, ngempela akazange.
I live in a house.	Ngihlala endlini.
There is a father.	Kukhona ubaba.
And thank you, it was nice to see you there.	Futhi ngiyabonga, kube kuhle ukukubona lapho.
It can be very helpful to know.	Kungaba usizo kakhulu ukwazi.
He left yesterday.	Uhambe izolo.
Because he could not live like this.	Ngoba ubengeke akwazi ukuphila kanje.
In the end, he said it was all right.	Ekugcineni, wathi kulungile.
This can be easy or difficult.	Lokhu kungase kube lula noma kube nzima.
He got out of there immediately.	Waphuma lapho ngokushesha.
And that's not a bad thing.	Futhi akuyona into embi leyo.
But it has been difficult.	Kodwa kube nzima.
I did not go to the office.	Angizange ngiye ehhovisi.
No one should see such a thing.	Akekho okufanele abone into enjalo.
I even live there.	Ngisho ngihlala khona.
Probably, at least.	Cishe, okungenani.
He works fast.	Usebenza ngokushesha.
Now you have to go.	Manje kufanele uhambe.
And he will not be alone.	Futhi ngeke abe yedwa.
No one else should be there.	Akekho omunye okufanele abe khona.
Or just one child.	Noma ingane eyodwa kuphela.
Sometimes it is better if it happens.	Ngezinye izikhathi kungcono uma kwenzeka.
I mean something is not in the world.	Ngisho ukuthi into ayikho emhlabeni.
My mother already lives here.	Umama usevele ehlala lapha.
You do not need to know all of that.	Awudingi ukwazi konke lokho.
At least that is the case with me.	Okungenani kunjalo kimi.
All his stuff too.	Zonke izinto zakhe futhi.
You need to be here.	Udinga ukuba lapha.
This should be done here.	Lokhu kufanele kwenziwe lapha.
Thobile didn't know what to do now.	UThobile wayengazi ukuthi enzeni manje.
This is my gift to the world.	Lesi isipho sami emhlabeni.
At work.	Emsebenzini.
I tried to take my life.	Ngazama ukuthatha ukuphila kwami.
And obviously, and you didn't have him.	Futhi ngokusobala, futhi awuzange naye.
It would have been better if he had not.	Kungase kube ngcono ukube akazange.
But he did not have time.	Kodwa wayengenaso isikhathi.
You didn't really.	Awuzange ngempela.
But the best place.	Kodwa indawo engcono kakhulu.
And when we make a mistake.	Futhi lapho senza iphutha.
He says he is worried about you.	Uthi ukhathazekile ngawe.
And, of course.	Futhi, kunjalo.
It will not always happen but more often than not.	Ngeke kwenzeke ngaso sonke isikhathi kodwa kaningi kunalokho.
The question is.	Umbuzo uthi.
I think that's the only thing right now.	Ngicabanga ukuthi yilokho kuphela okwamanje.
I want to help my baby.	Ngifuna ukusiza ingane yami.
Absolutely your choice.	Ngokuphelele ukukhetha kwakho.
We know what's coming.	Siyazi ukuthi yini ezayo.
But maybe something.	Kodwa mhlawumbe kukhona okuthile.
I had to find the truth.	Kwadingeka ngithole iqiniso.
I think early is the best.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kusenesikhathi kungcono kakhulu.
And we want.	Futhi sifuna.
You will have that.	Uzoba nakho lokho.
This is just reading.	Lokhu ukufunda nje.
Your mother? 	Umama wakho?
It is not a place to make friends.	Akuyona indawo yokwenza abangani.
Too bad that would have been my baby.	Okubi kakhulu ngabe ingane yami leyo.
This week, that.	Kuleli sonto, lokho.
I hope you had a good time.	Ngethemba ukuthi ube nesikhathi esihle.
A lot, now, a lot.	Okuningi, manje, okuningi.
That’s hard to do the job.	Lokho kunzima ukwenza umsebenzi.
Indeed, he did not need to say anything.	Ngempela, kwakungadingeki ukuthi asho lutho.
You can do this only once.	Lokhu ungakwenza kanye kuphela.
He wanted to do it again.	Wayefuna ukukwenza futhi.
He refused at first.	Wenqaba ekuqaleni.
As long as you go.	Uma nje uhamba.
It is good to have a place with us.	Kuhle ukuba nathi indawo.
That's another story.	Enye indaba leyo.
I told everyone.	Ngatshela wonke umuntu.
We need to do the same.	Nathi kufanele senze kanjalo.
There is a nice restaurant nearby.	Kukhona indawo yokudlela enhle eduze.
We must definitely make a mistake.	Kufanele nakanjani senze iphutha.
That is good for us.	Lokho kuhle kithi.
Well he refused.	Kulungile wenqaba.
Or maybe something else.	Noma mhlawumbe okunye.
I came to work.	Ngize emsebenzini.
His mind is troubled.	Umqondo wakhe ukhathazekile.
And no, not at all.	Futhi cha, hhayi konke.
Obviously that seems to be true.	Ngokusobala lokho kubonakala kuyiqiniso.
It could be your telling or my reading.	Kungaba ukutshela kwakho noma ukufunda kwami.
That at least is possible.	Lokho okungenani kungenzeka.
Coming home.	Ukuza ekhaya.
But it was definitely not worth it.	Kodwa kwakungafanele neze.
What to do about it.	Okufanele ukwenze ngakho.
He was not sure who he wanted to work with.	Wayengenaso isiqiniseko sokuthi ufuna ukusebenza nobani.
That is not a choice.	Lokho akukhona ukukhetha.
He came back.	Abuye abuye.
I had to wait and see.	Kwadingeka ngilinde futhi ngibone.
This is my car.	Imoto yami lena.
Today, this is not the case.	Namuhla, lokhu akunjalo.
Not all at once, but all day long.	Hhayi konke ngesikhathi esisodwa, kodwa usuku lonke.
She is trying to get married again.	Uzama ukushada futhi.
Another story entirely.	Enye indaba ngokuphelele.

I didn't know about you.	Ngangingazi ngani .
He told me where and when.	Wangitshela ukuthi kuphi futhi nini.
It should be for all of us.	Kufanele kube kithi sonke.

He already knew.	Wayazi kakade.
Very, very, very good.	Kakhulu, kakhulu, muhle kakhulu.
Now that is very difficult.	Manje lokho kunzima kakhulu.
She felt like crying.	Wazizwa efuna ukukhala.

He saw that she was eating well.	Wabona ukuthi udla kahle.
He said he wanted to help.	Uthe ufuna ukusiza.
And later the meat.	Futhi kamuva inyama.
Yes and you know it.	Yebo futhi uyazi.
I know he left town about thirty years ago.	Ngiyazi ukuthi wahamba edolobheni cishe eminyakeni engamashumi amathathu edlule.
But maybe not at all.	Kodwa mhlawumbe hhayi kukho konke.
We all need sleep.	Sonke sidinga ukulala.

If so, she needed to know.	Uma kunjalo, kwakudingeka azi.
And it will not be too easy or easy to do.	Futhi ngeke kube lula kakhulu noma kube lula ukwenza.
You just say so yourself.	Usho kanjalo nje wena.
It should have been music.	Bekufanele kube umculo.
He wondered if he knew about it.	Wazibuza ukuthi ngabe uyazi yini ngakho.
Immediately, he left.	Ngokushesha, wahamba.
I would like to try to end this.	Ngingathanda ukuzama ukuqeda lokhu.

He agreed to come to her.	Wavuma ukuthi eze kuye.
One works only as much as the other.	Omunye usebenza kuphela njengoba omunye.
If it's hard, that's fine.	Uma kunzima, kuhle.
I can't even tell you how long.	Angikwazi ngisho ukukutshela ukuthi kuze kube nini.
He knew he knew nothing about her.	Wayazi ukuthi wayengazi lutho ngaye.
Or too small.	Noma encane kakhulu.
Good enough to drive again.	Kuhle ngokwanele ukushayela futhi.
He said it is very difficult.	Uthe kunzima kakhulu.
We know you think of us that way.	Siyazi ukuthi ucabanga ngathi kanjalo.

He had to leave, and soon.	Kwadingeka ahambe, futhi ngokushesha.
We can't find out what happened.	Asikwazi ukuthola ukuthi kwenzekeni.
He decided to stop drinking for a while.	Wanquma ukuyeka ukuphuza isikhashana.
But do not do this.	Kodwa ungakwenzi lokhu.
It should not be for everyone.	Akumele kube wonke umuntu.
I feel like you should be my friend.	Ngizwa sengathi kufanele ube umngane wami.
Or he may be able to help out at home.	Noma angase asize endlini.
I can do better here alone.	Ngingakwenza kangcono lapha ngedwa.
Just trying to think.	Ezama ukucabanga nje.
You can't log out now.	Awukwazi ukuphuma manje.
Not everyone does.	Akuwona wonke umuntu kunjalo.
Now it will be very difficult.	Manje kuzoba nzima kakhulu.
He wants us to be together.	Ufuna sibe ndawonye.
My father was not my father.	Ubaba wayengeyena ubaba wami.
Probably, not just at this time.	Mhlawumbe, hhayi nje ngalesi sikhathi.
Anyway, that's what I read about.	Noma kunjalo, lokho ukufunda kwami ​​ngakho.
You say as well as you can.	Usho kahle ngangokunokwenzeka.
He is the one who has to go.	Uyena okumele ahambe.
Let me be your friend for this very moment.	Ake ngibe umngane wakho kulokhu kanye.
When he came to her he spoke immediately.	Wathi efika kuye wakhuluma ngokushesha.
She tries to walk slowly.	Uzama ukuhamba kancane.
There is really nothing wrong with that.	Impela akukho okubi ngalokho.
Everyone needs a place.	Wonke umuntu udinga indawo yakhe.
That seems too much, right ?.	Lokho kubonakala kuningi kakhulu, cha?.
I wanted to go out into the world.	Ngangifuna ukuphuma ngiye emhlabeni.
Every day we want to get better.	Nsuku zonke sifuna ukuba ngcono.
You know nothing about that.	Awazi lutho nhlobo ngalokho.
As much as possible, though.	Okuningi ngangokunokwenzeka, noma kunjalo.
There is nothing to me there.	Akukho lutho kimi lapho.
Yes, you will be wrong.	Yebo, uzobe unephutha.
I just feel a lie.	Ngizwa amanga nje.
So with everything.	Ngakho ngakho konke.
He could not take the house.	Akakwazanga ukuthatha indlu.
You've been out of me, you know.	Uke waphuma kimi, uyazi.
To do it this way.	Ukwenza ngale ndlela.
Or how fast.	Noma ngokushesha kangakanani.
Everyone always talks about him, you know.	Wonke umuntu uhlala ekhuluma ngaye, uyazi.
What we have to do we have to do.	Okufanele sikwenze kufanele sikwenze.
Slowly almost.	Kancane kancane cishe.
The boy wanted money.	Umfana wayefuna imali.
All of that is very good.	Konke lokho kuhle kakhulu.
He should not know.	Akumele azi.
And depending on where you live Yes.	Futhi kuye ngokuthi uhlala kuphi Yebo.
He thinks and speaks.	Acabange akhulume.
But let me go with you.	Kodwa ake ngihambe nawe.
So is he? 	Kanjalo naye?
Not in this case, and everyone knew.	Hhayi kulokhu, futhi wonke umuntu wayazi.
But he probably thought so.	Kodwa kungenzeka ukuthi wacabanga .
Before anything else happens.	Ngaphambi kokuba kwenzeke noma yini enye.
And you can do that too.	Futhi nawe ungakwenza lokho.
He came forward.	Weza ngaphambili.
But it will be so tonight.	Kodwa kuzoba njalo kusihlwa.
He did not want anyone to know.	Wayengafuni noma ubani azi.
I had to travel many times.	Kwadingeka ngihambe kaningi.
He doesn't want to be there.	Akafuni ukuba lapho.
I really went with that here.	Ngempela ngihambe nalokho lapha.
I want more.	Ngifuna okwengeziwe .
Finally, he just walked away.	Ekugcineni, wavele wahamba.
And you can't do that.	Futhi awukwazi ukwenza lokho.
I want you to dress the same way tomorrow.	Ngifuna ugqoke ngendlela efanayo kusasa.
I'm waiting to do that.	Ngilinde ukwenza lokho.
This is not our job.	Akuwona umsebenzi wethu lo.
He knows everything you need to do.	Wazi konke okudingeka ukwenze.
No, he did not.	Cha, waqaphela.
Thanks for saying that.	Ngiyabonga ukusho lokho.
You should know why.	Kufanele wazi ukuthi kungani.
I mean, not immediately.	Ngisho, hhayi ngokushesha.
He did all this slowly.	Konke lokhu wakwenza kancane.
The police did everything they could.	Amaphoyisa enza konke angakwenza.
We got a lot of feedback.	Sithole impendulo eminingi.
He can really sing.	Angakwazi ngempela ukucula.
That would be nice to see you.	Lokho kuzoba kuhle ukukubona.
But you have to get the idea.	Kodwa kufanele uthole umqondo.
He never mentioned this to me.	Akakaze akhulume ngalokhu kimi.
I said thank you but no thank you.	Ngathi ngiyabonga kodwa cha ngiyabonga.
A lot is said.	Kuningi okushiwo.
You do not want to know.	Awufuni ukwazi.
Or small.	Noma encane.
Not to this day.	Hhayi kuze kube namuhla.
Not just play.	Hhayi nje ukudlala.
This will be good for both of us.	Lokhu kuzoba kuhle kithi sobabili.
But it can happen to anyone.	Kodwa kungenzeka noma ubani.
This, of course, is not necessary.	Lokhu, ngempela, akudingekile.
This is a long time ago.	Lesi isikhathi eside ngaphambili.
So he did.	Ngakho wakwenza.
He won't talk about that, either.	Ngeke akhulume ngalokho, futhi.
But yes, there is a danger.	Kodwa yebo, kukhona ingozi.
But you need more.	Kodwa udinga okunye okwengeziwe.
We know you should.	Siyazi ukuthi kufanele.
She is not at school.	Akekho esikoleni.
It has to be for you.	Kufanele kube ngawe.
Lies and everything.	Amanga kanye nakho konke.
He knew exactly where and when.	Wayazi kahle ukuthi kuphi futhi nini.
Not a great choice.	Akukhona ukukhetha okukhulu.
But maybe even him.	Kodwa mhlawumbe ngisho naye.
Home remodeling.	Ukulungisa endlini.
Or at least anything you need to know.	Noma okungenani noma yini okudingeka ukwazi.
I think you know that about me.	Ngicabanga ukuthi uyakwazi lokho ngami.
This is a great way to do it.	Lena indlela enhle yokwenza.

But something else happened.	Kodwa kukhona okunye futhi okwenzeka.
And in a good way.	Futhi ngendlela enhle.
This will definitely not be easy.	Lokhu ngeke nakanjani kube lula.
So many problems in the world today.	Izinkinga eziningi kangaka emhlabeni namuhla.
But you can't take a chance.	Kodwa awukwazi ukuthatha ithuba.
We need one more.	Sidinga omunye futhi.
I used to think that.	Ngike ngicabange lokho.
I have never been so good at work.	Angikaze ngibe muhle kakhulu emsebenzini.
You're gone too.	Nawe uhambe .
I think it might be.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kungase kube khona.
He does not have much time.	Akanaso isikhathi esiningi.
Big money here.	Imali enkulu lapha.
But when you need to stop.	Kodwa lapho udinga ukuyeka.
But you, once.	Kodwa wena, kanye .
But it did not have to be this way.	Kodwa kwakungadingeki kube khona.
You know, up.	Uyazi, phezulu.
But not now, not today.	Kodwa hhayi manje, hhayi namuhla.
Not always, of course, but always.	Hhayi njalo, kunjalo, kodwa njalo.
She got a little better.	Waba ngcono kancane.
There is no danger to you here.	Ayikho ingozi kuwe lapha.
To do something good in the world.	Ukwenza into enhle emhlabeni.
So that sometimes happens.	Ngakho lokho ngezinye izikhathi kwenzeka.
He actually said it was his fault.	Empeleni wathi iphutha lakhe.
Or rather yes.	Noma kunalokho yebo.
Who thinks like me.	Ubani ocabanga njengami.
It could be now.	Kungaba manje.
I don't have a good answer.	Anginayo impendulo enhle.

You do not need to think about it.	Awudingi ukucabanga ngakho.
It is not just a good thing to do.	Akuyona nje into enhle ukuyenza.
Well, very well.	Kahle, kahle kakhulu.
Mother, in prison.	Umama, ejele.

Now everyone knows everything.	Manje wonke umuntu wazi konke.
The best thing.	Into engcono kakhulu.
You know exactly what you are talking about.	Uyazi kahle ukuthi ukhuluma ngani.
So far, obviously.	Kuze kube manje, ngokusobala.
His home is here with us.	Umuzi wakhe ulapha kithi.
I did not wait for him to come.	Angizange ngilinde ukuthi eze.
He really wanted me to be happy.	Wayefuna ngempela ngijabule.
I too asked for help.	Nami ngacela usizo.
If he has to come to her.	Uma kufanele afike kuye.
He can do anything for me.	Angenza noma yini ngenxa yami.
Slowly or sometimes not slowly.	Kancane kancane noma ngezinye izikhathi hhayi kancane.
Even really great.	Ngisho enkulu ngempela.
So here,.	Ngakho lapha,.
He talked a lot about her.	Wakhuluma kakhulu ngaye.
It probably shouldn't have happened.	Cishe kwakungafanele kwenzeke.
And he is coming home.	Futhi uyeza ekhaya.
He never got there.	Akazange afike lapho.
I think it has been great.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kube kuhle kakhulu.
Not appropriate.	Akuyona efanele.
And, more than enough.	Futhi, okuningi ngokwanele ngokwanele.

You will know why anyway.	Uzokwazi ukuthi kungani noma kunjalo.
And it should, because it is.	Futhi kufanele, ngoba kunjalo.
This is really obvious when you think about it.	Lokhu kusobala ngempela uma ucabanga ngakho.

I need to finish my book.	Ngidinga ukuqeda incwadi yami.
And she is beautiful anyway.	Futhi muhle kunjalo.
It may be a little busy at times.	Kungase kube matasa kancane ngezinye izikhathi.
We want to go home as soon as possible.	Sifuna ukuya ekhaya ngokushesha okukhulu.
Maybe he'll be back soon.	Mhlawumbe uzobuya maduze.
And he's a great guy.	Futhi ungumfana omkhulu.
You will be fine with him.	Uzoba kahle naye.
And no one else.	Futhi akekho omunye umuntu.
I think about him, too, you know.	Ngicabanga ngaye, futhi, uyazi.
But there is another big truth.	Kodwa kukhona futhi elinye iqiniso elikhulu.
Play may be too long.	Ukudlala kungenzeka isikhathi eside kakhulu.
He never wanted to go in there again.	Akazange aphinde afune ukungena lapho.
And maybe he'll come back again.	Futhi mhlawumbe uzobuya futhi.
He could do nothing about it.	Akakwazanga ukwenza lutho ngakho.
He cannot live that long.	Akakwazi ukuphila isikhathi eside kanje.
Almost always another answer.	Cishe njalo enye impendulo.
He plays hard every night.	Udlala kanzima njalo ebusuku.
He refused to come.	Wenqaba ukuza .
I didn't know he could do that.	Bengingazi ukuthi angakwenza lokho.
It should be his breakfast.	Kufanele kube isidlo sakhe sasekuseni.
It could be in bed.	Kungenzeka embhedeni.
That's good for you.	Kuhle kuwe lokho.
So there is an opportunity here.	Ngakho kukhona ithuba lapha.
And this is not always the case.	Futhi akunjalo ngaso sonke isikhathi.
Or maybe not.	Noma mhlawumbe ngeke.
Not too low about it.	Hhayi ukuba phansi kakhulu ngakho.
He too did his best.	Naye wenza konke okusemandleni akhe.
There is nothing about him here.	Akukho lutho ngaye lapha.
I want to get back to you.	Ngifuna ukubuyela kuwe.
I too did not want to know more.	Nami ngangingafuni ukwazi okwengeziwe.
But there is nothing he can do here.	Kodwa akukho angakwenza lapha.

So it all happened.	Ngakho konke okwenzekile.
You want to do some things.	Ufuna ukwenza ezinye izinto.
Still, you would not say.	Noma kunjalo, ubungeke usho.

Just say it as it is.	Ukusho nje njengoba kunjalo.
Something else needed to be done.	Kukhona okunye okwakudingeka kwenziwe.
He said he had to stay home to study.	Wathi kumele ahlale ekhaya ukuze afunde.

Instead he heard a lot.	Kunalokho wezwa kakhulu.
It should be done as soon as possible.	Kufanele kwenziwe ngokushesha ngangokunokwenzeka.
You will not know.	Ngeke ukwazi .
I already know.	Ngiyazi kakade.
I could not live without her.	Angikwazanga ukuphila ngaphandle kwakhe.
She looked at her children.	Wabuka izingane zakhe.
It is not the best place.	Akuyona indawo engcono kakhulu.
In this case, no.	Kulokhu, cha.
There is no food in the room.	Akukho ukudla ekamelweni.
Everyone is trying to take everyone.	Wonke umuntu uzama ukuthatha wonke umuntu.
I will not do it tomorrow.	Ngeke ngikwenze kusasa.

In this, together.	Kulokhu, ndawonye.
So or anything else.	Kanjalo noma yini enye.
You will be a cat.	Uzoba ikati.
We did not leave at that time.	Asizange sihambe ngaleso sikhathi.
Only at school.	Esikoleni kuphela.
Eventually, he had to leave.	Ekugcineni, kwadingeka ahambe.
He became my best friend.	Waba umngane wami omkhulu.
At least now you know.	Okungenani manje uyazi.
You need this.	Udinga lena.

If only for a moment.	Ukube nje isikhashana.
I can do this.	Ngingakwenza lokhu .
You think about it a lot.	Ucabanga ngakho kakhulu.
He took things, too.	Wathatha izinto, futhi.
I came for work.	Ngize ngomsebenzi.
He didn't want to give up too much.	Wayengafuni ukuyeka kakhulu.
Please, I will do anything.	Ngicela, ngizokwenza noma yini.
You should be asleep by now.	Kufanele ngabe ulele manje.
That's what this place is.	Yilokho le ndawo.
What do you mean? 	Usho ukuthini?
Well next week.	Kahle ngesonto elizayo.
There may be something to this.	Kungase kube khona okuthile kulokhu.
He said nothing about it.	Akazange atshele lutho ngalokho.
Or better yet, three months.	Noma kungcono, izinyanga ezintathu.
But he probably would not.	Kodwa cishe wayengeke.
I'm really sorry, really, really.	Ngiyaxolisa ngempela, ngempela, ngempela.
Perhaps you have felt the same way.	Mhlawumbe nawe wazizwa ngendlela efanayo.
As I said.	Njengoba ngisho.

Or at least that's my opinion.	Noma okungenani lowo umbono wami.

Or rather he tried to stop doing anything.	Noma kunalokho wazama ukuyeka ukwenza noma yini.
That is not a decision.	Lokho akusona isinqumo.
This time power means more than that.	Lesi sikhathi amandla asho okukhulu kunalokho.
I thought she was very beautiful.	Bengithi muhle kakhulu.
I could not really go there.	Angikwazanga ngempela ukuya lapho.
You can feel everything as if you really exist.	Ungakwazi ukuzwa yonke into sengathi ukhona ngempela.
Not us.	Hhayi nathi.
Maybe that's the key.	Mhlawumbe ukhiye lowo.
Do not do this.	Ungakwenzi lokhu .
No, he did more.	Cha, wenza okwengeziwe.
Anyway, anyway.	Noma kunjalo, noma kunjalo.

At least it should.	Okungenani kufanele.
I can't stop talking about you.	Angikwazi ukuyeka ukukhuluma ngawe.
Sometimes on the weekend or at night, the exit is late.	Ngezinye izikhathi ngempelasonto noma ebusuku, ukuphuma sekwephuzile.
I could not get back to my place.	Angikwazanga ukubuyela endaweni yami.
I don't really know how.	Angazi ngempela kanjani.
It should be a little harder.	Kufanele kube nzima kancane.

This too had to happen.	Nalokhu kwakufanele kwenzeke.
I know, because he told me about it before.	Ngiyazi, ngoba wangitshela ngakho ngaphambili.
The view surprised me.	Umbono wamangala.
Just the way.	Indlela nje.
Not playing with that.	Hhayi ukudlala ngalokho.
He should not have done that.	Bekungafanele enze lokho.
But he did not think about it.	Kodwa akazange acabange ngakho.
That's just hard.	Ukuthi nje kunzima.
There is no stopping.	Akukho ukuyeka.
It’s not just cooking.	Akukhona nje ukupheka.
If necessary.	Uma kwadingeka.
He likes to stay with us all the time.	Uthanda ukuhlala nathi ngaso sonke isikhathi.
Not yet, maybe not.	Hhayi okwamanje, mhlawumbe akunjalo.
You can't see the picture properly.	Awukwazi ukubona isithombe kahle.

Help me find my father.	Ngisize ngithole ubaba.
And there is no choice.	Futhi akukho ukukhetha.
Nothing big at all.	Ayikho into enkulu nhlobo.

However, he was not.	Noma kunjalo, wayengekho.

That's right, well.	Kunjalo, kahle.
You just need to lie down and stay in town.	Udinga nje ukulala phansi futhi uhlale edolobheni.
But even so, he could not restrain himself.	Kodwa noma kunjalo, akakwazanga ukuzibamba.
He saw that.	Wabona kunjalo.
Not the answer.	Akuyona impendulo.
I wanted to know how it happened, why it happened.	Ngangifuna ukwazi ukuthi kwenzeka kanjani, kungani kwenzeka.
But it is worth the time.	Kodwa kufanele isikhathi.
We are doing something new.	Senza into entsha.
I want to see you.	Ngifuna ukukubona .
It can be very easy to learn.	Kungaba lula kakhulu ukufunda.
It should be so.	Kufanele ngabe kunjalo.
And he knew nothing at all.	Futhi wayengazi lutho nhlobo.
I think he told his mother.	Ngicabanga ukuthi watshela umama wakhe.
At least a lot of people.	Okungenani abantu abaningi.
I don't see anything out yet.	Angiboni lutho ngaphandle okwamanje.
Only you and I are here.	Kukhona mina nawe kuphela lapha.
I think you really deserve that.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kumele ngempela lokho.
He said there was no one else in the area.	Uthe akekho omunye umuntu endaweni.
He had to go.	Bekumele ahambe.
First of all, you probably never thought about it.	Okokuqala, kungenzeka awuzange ucabange ngakho.
Soon, the mood improved.	Ngokushesha, umoya waba ngcono.
What needs to be done must be done.	Okufanele kwenziwe kumele kwenziwe.
He often does.	Uvame ukwenza.
You can easily spend the whole day here.	Ungakwazi kalula ukuchitha usuku lonke lapha.
When something happens.	Uma kwenzeka okuthile .
Walking alone.	Ehamba yedwa.
Everything should be better and better.	Konke kufanele kube ngcono futhi kube ngcono.
Almost every year.	Cishe njalo ngonyaka.
Obviously, that did not happen.	Ngokusobala, lokho akuzange kwenzeke.
But he was not the father.	Kodwa kwakungeyena ubaba.
He does not have to know everything.	Akumele azi konke.
Let me be here for you today.	Ake ngibe lapha kuwe namuhla.
Anything, anytime.	Noma yini, noma nini.
Not just to you, but to me.	Hhayi nje kuwe, kodwa kimi.
We did not have long.	Asizange sibe nesikhathi eside.
But more is needed, and more quickly.	Kodwa kudingeka okwengeziwe, futhi ngokushesha.
Really fast.	Ngokushesha ngempela.
She's very fine, doctor.	Muhle kakhulu, udokotela.
I'm afraid to be alone here.	Ngesaba ukuba ngedwa lapha.
I think it's much better.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kungcono kakhulu.
Shouldn’t it.	Akufanele yini .
The book yes.	Incwadi yebo.
It is difficult to determine who is at fault.	Kunzima ukuthola ukuthi ubani iphutha.
Maybe she would love her son.	Mhlawumbe angathanda indodana yakhe.
I always like.	Ngihlala ngithanda.
But we probably won't do much.	Kodwa cishe ngeke senze okuningi.
I found some more.	Ngithole okunye okwengeziwe.
Finally he entered.	Ekugcineni wangena.
No one else knows this way.	Akekho omunye owaziyo ngale ndlela.
He is also not human.	Akuyena futhi umuntu.
You do not have to do anything.	Akudingekile ukuba wenze noma yini.
More than that.	Kakhulu kunalokho.
At least in his place.	Okungenani endaweni yakhe.
Redoing is not a problem.	Ukwenza kabusha akuyona inkinga.
Alone, always alone.	Ngedwa, njalo wedwa.
Because it's true, he did it.	Ngoba kuyiqiniso, wakwenza.
Very close.	Eduze kakhulu .
You will not end up like him.	Ngeke ugcine ufana naye.
He wondered what it really was.	Wazibuza ukuthi ngabe yini ngempela.
You know who you are looking for.	Uyazi ukuthi ufuna bani.
He tried to think of something to do.	Wazama ukucabanga ukuthi enzeni.
That sounds like you.	Lokho kuzwakala njengawe.
Not just a good message.	Hhayi nje umlayezo omuhle.
You will be late for school.	Uzofika sekwephuzile esikoleni.
You made a mistake here.	Wenze iphutha lapha.
Really a place.	Impela indawo.
I need to find this.	Ngidinga ukuthola lokhu.
We need to find someone else.	Sidinga ukuthola omunye umuntu.
You know he wouldn't talk to me after you.	Uyazi ubengeke akhulume nami ngemuva kwakho.
It is very difficult to live without him.	Kunzima kakhulu ukuphila ngaphandle kwakhe.
I'm waiting for this book.	Ngilinde le ncwadi.
He tried to do it the same way.	Wazama ukukwenza ngendlela efanayo.
There is a whole system.	Kukhona uhlelo lonke.
Probably not.	Cishe ngeke .
There is a great danger.	Kukhona ingozi enkulu.
I think not.	Ngicabanga ukuthi cha.
That was necessary, of course.	Lokho kwakudingeka, kunjalo.
He was not in the house.	Wayengekho endlini.
I must not speak.	Akumele ngikhulume.
He hoped it would get better.	Wayenethemba lokuthi kuzoba ngcono.
You read in the room.	Ufunda ekamelweni.
I want to do more.	Ngifuna ukwenza okwengeziwe.
How nice to be here for me.	Kuhle kanjani ukuba lapha kimi.
Gradually he agreed.	Kancane kancane wavuma.
I mean sure.	Ngisho isiqiniseko.
There are pictures.	Kukhona izithombe.
He's really talented, you know.	Unekhono ngempela, uyazi.
You have been very present.	Ube khona kakhulu.
I mean the worst thing.	Ngisho into embi kakhulu.
I don't have one.	Anginayo enye.
But that's not why you're here.	Kodwa akusona isizathu ulapha.
It is very difficult to do, this.	Kunzima kakhulu ukukwenza, lokhu.
I could not see which one.	Angikwazanga ukubona ukuthi iyiphi.
It may be more than you think.	Kungenzeka kakhulu kunalokho ucabanga.
I saw no.	Ngabona cha.
It will be a little difficult.	Kuzoba nzima kancane.
I'm so glad you feel better!	Ngijabule kakhulu ukuthi uzizwa ungcono!
But it is not your job.	Kodwa akuwona umsebenzi wakho.
I am sure he will come closer to me.	Nginesiqiniseko sokuthi uzofika eduze kwami.
No, it is not.	Cha, kusobala ukuthi akunjalo.
But someone had to do it.	Kodwa othile kwakufanele akwenze.
He did not think so.	Wayengacabangi ukuthi kuzoba njalo.
And no one is coming.	Futhi akekho ozayo.
Yes, good job.	Yebo, umsebenzi omuhle.
But it may also be new.	Kodwa kungase futhi kube entsha.
He doesn't really know what to do with it.	Akazi ngempela ukuthi enzeni ngakho.
Up in your classroom.	Phezulu ekilasini lakho.
And he thought about it.	Futhi wacabanga ngakho.
He fears everyone and everything.	Wesaba wonke umuntu nakho konke.
He once said.	Wake wathi .
This is okay at the top.	Lokhu kulungile phezulu.
She was afraid to sleep.	Wayesaba ukulala.
I wonder if you just know.	Kazi ukwazi nje.
We should not have done it.	Bekungafanele sikwenze.
He just stared.	Wavele wabheka.
You will know what to do.	Uzokwazi okufanele ukwenze.
But it could be a very good thing.	Kodwa kungaba khona into enhle kakhulu.
Taking the wrong answer.	Ukuthatha impendulo kabi.
I need it every day.	Ngidinga nsuku zonke.
It may also be a permanent one.	Kungase futhi kube enye ehlala njalo.
A great, great friend for many years.	Umngane omkhulu, omkhulu iminyaka eminingi.
You have to be your own person.	Kumele ube umuntu wakho.
That was his only reply.	Impendulo yakhe kuphela leyo.
You will need his help.	Uzodinga usizo lwakhe.
I mean, never.	Ngisho, neze.
It can be difficult to say who he is.	Kungaba nzima ukusho ukuthi ubani.
But whoever that is, you did a good job.	Kodwa noma ngabe ubani lowo, wenze umsebenzi omuhle.
No, it is not.	Cha, akudingekile.
Not only could he, he did it.	Akakwazanga nje kuphela, wakwenza.
Even you, I'm sorry.	Ngisho nawe, ngiyaxolisa.
I have been thinking since yesterday.	Bengilokhu ngicabanga kusukela izolo.
He started trying.	Waqala ukuzama.
He likes to ride in a car.	Uthanda ukugibela emotweni.
But no, no, that's not true.	Kodwa cha, cha, akulona iqiniso lelo.
Obviously nothing more was needed.	Ngokusobala akukho okunye okwakudingeka.
What is happening in the world there.	Kwenzekani emhlabeni lapho.
I just never thought about it before.	Angikaze nje ngicabange ngakho ngaphambili.
You must not tell me anything.	Akumele ungitshele lutho.
And he did a good job.	Futhi wenza umsebenzi omuhle.
That is the only thing any of us can do.	Yilokho kuphela noma ubani wethu angakwenza.
I think he is the best player in the world.	Ngicabanga ukuthi ungumdlali ongcono kakhulu emhlabeni.
It doesn't matter who he is.	Akusho lutho nokuthi ubani.
When you walk, you are alone.	Uma uhamba, uwedwa.
And who wants.	Futhi ubani ofuna.
Nothing, just nothing.	Lutho, lutho nje.
I had to go with all the food.	Bekumele ngihambe nakho konke ukudla.
You should consider getting married.	Kufanele ucabange ukushada.
And yet it is not a big problem.	Futhi okwamanje akuyona inkinga enkulu.
Not death.	Hhayi ukufa.
Of course there is almost nothing there.	Kuyiqiniso ukuthi cishe akukho lutho lapho.
It was clear he was thinking too much.	Kwacaca ukuthi ucabanga kakhulu.
I will make it very easy here.	Ngizokwenza kube lula kakhulu lapha.
The worst can be death.	Okubi kakhulu kungaba ukufa kuphela.
He probably never did.	Cishe akakaze akwenze.
This is difficult, that's all.	Lokhu kunzima, yilokho kuphela.
He knew it would be easy.	Wayazi ukuthi kuzoba lula.
Great church.	Isonto elikhulu.
Worse than that.	Okubi kunalokho.
As you live there.	Njengoba uhlala lapho.
I need to go to work tonight.	Ngidinga ukuya emsebenzini namhlanje ebusuku.
I know you're worried about me.	Ngiyazi ukuthi ukhathazekile ngami.
There is always the opportunity to make money.	Kukhona njalo ithuba lokwenza imali.
At least he said he wanted to.	Okungenani uthe uyafuna.
We know how hard you work.	Siyazi ukuthi usebenza kanzima kangakanani.
We do everything.	Senza konke.
That is the choice.	Yilokho ukukhetha.
I don't know what to do with you.	Angazi ngenzeni ngawe.
Of course, you never did.	Kunjalo, awukaze wenze.
I certainly know better.	Impela ngazi kangcono.
I just feel the same way.	Ngizizwa ngendlela efanayo nje.
I know a little bit.	Ngiyazi kancane.
That something bad happened.	Ukuthi kwenzeke into embi.
It's really obvious.	Kusobala ngempela.
Not to him, but to him.	Hhayi kuye, kodwa naye.
In this and all.	Kulokhu kanye nakho konke.
Good, good.	Kuhle, kuhle.
I want to do this alone.	Ngifuna ukwenze wedwa lokhu.
Good but !!.	Kuhle kodwa!!.
Stop saying that.	Yeka ukusho.
I just know how you feel.	Ngiyazi nje ukuthi uzizwa kanjani.
Worse, in this case.	Okubi kakhulu, kulokhu.
He heard something else.	Wezwa okunye.
How he wanted.	Wayefuna kanjani.
Fact or story.	Iqiniso noma indaba.
He did it, too, in the end.	Wakwenza, futhi, ekugcineni.
Very good sometimes.	Kuhle kakhulu ngezinye izikhathi.
I live alone, really alone.	Ngihlala ngedwa, ngedwa ngempela.
Thanks for the work.	Ngiyabonga umsebenzi.
Either way is not something you want to play with.	Noma iyiphi indlela akuyona into ofuna ukudlala ngayo.
And no one wants to talk about it.	Futhi akekho ofuna ukukhuluma ngakho.
And again in a week.	Futhi futhi ngesonto.
Worse, it's very obvious.	Kabi, kusobala kakhulu.
And this is what happens.	Futhi lokhu kwenzeka.
Here and now, he knew nothing.	Lapha futhi manje, wayengazi lutho.
That is why it is so obvious.	Yingakho kusobala.
All right, so you can see it.	Kulungile, ukuze ukwazi ukukubona.
The message is simply not visible.	Umlayezo awubonakali nje.
Also, you probably know how to do this.	Futhi, cishe uyazi ukuthi ungakwenza kanjani lokhu.
You are better than me.	Ungcono nami.
I have no time and, at the moment, money.	Anginaso isikhathi futhi, okwamanje, imali.
And this is your choice.	Futhi lokhu ukukhetha kwakho.
This must have been a coincidence.	Kumelwe ukuba lokhu kwenzeka nje.
This is also not my home.	Akuwona futhi umuzi wami lo.
He felt happy about that.	Wazizwa ejabule ngalokho.
I couldn't help but think of that.	Angikwazanga ukuzibamba ngicabanga ngalokho.
It just has to.	Kumelwe nje.
And he is a great man.	Futhi uyindoda enkulu.
You have found that this is not really the case.	Uthole ukuthi lokhu akunjalo ngempela.
Slowly but surely.	Kancane kancane, kodwa kunjalo.
For me, there is no time at all.	Kimi, asikho isikhathi nhlobo.
He must learn to be alone.	Kufanele afunde ukuba yedwa.
He told me so yesterday.	Ungitshele kanjalo yena izolo.
However, we will not go too fast.	Noma kunjalo, ngeke sihambe ngokushesha okukhulu.
I do better on my own.	Ngenza kangcono ngedwa.
He always makes a big point.	Uhlale wenza umqondo omkhulu.
I have to sit down.	Kumele ngihlale phansi.
At least it happened then.	Okungenani kwenzeka ngaleso sikhathi.
I'm sure that's okay for both of us.	Ngiqinisekile ukuthi lokho kulungile ngathi sobabili.
If so, please state.	Uma kunjalo, ngicela usho.
First the sound.	Okokuqala umsindo.
No one else did more.	Akekho omunye owenze okwengeziwe.
And not just water.	Futhi hhayi amanzi kuphela.
Everyone left except me.	Wonke umuntu wahamba ngaphandle kwami.
So, that would be it.	Ngakho, kungaba yilokho.
There is a case.	Kukhona icala.
My mother did this for the rest of her life.	Umama wami wakwenza lokhu impilo yakhe yonke.
He can't do it.	Akakwazi ukukwenza.
Not much else.	Hhayi okunye okuningi.
And he doesn't know about that.	Futhi akazi ngalokho.
He tried again, a little.	Wazama futhi, kancane.
But he was hopeful.	Kodwa wayenethemba.
But, there is more.	Kodwa, futhi kukhona okwengeziwe.
He wasn't sure he wanted to ride with her.	Wayengenaso isiqiniseko sokuthi ufuna ukugibela naye.
He probably wanted a beer.	Cishe wayefuna ubhiya.
Waiting, like me.	Ukulinda, njengami.
That's not my mother.	Akuyena umama wami lowo.
But that is good enough.	Kodwa lokho kuhle ngokwanele.
It was never made for me to leave.	Akuzange kwenziwe ukuthi ngihambe.
I have to get better.	Kufanele ngibe ngcono.
It should be hard to find.	Kufanele kube nzima ukuthola.
He pulled out a book first.	Wakhipha incwadi kuqala.
But he was not there now.	Kodwa wayengekho manje.
I'm sure you're wrong.	Ngiqinisekile ukuthi unephutha.
But still, he came home to me.	Kodwa noma kunjalo, weza ekhaya kimi.
Yes this will take time.	Yebo lokhu kuzothatha isikhathi.
I want that done right.	Ngifuna lokho kwenziwe kahle.
To keep you happy.	Ukuze uhlale ujabule.
I should have said your name.	Bekumele ngisho igama lakho.
That is also not a question.	Akuwona futhi umbuzo lowo.
Well, really, he thought.	Yebo, impela, wacabanga.
That's fine, yes.	Lokho kulungile, yebo.
My family talked about it.	Umndeni wami wakhuluma ngakho.
But it only happened once for a long time.	Kodwa kwenzeka kanye kuphela isikhathi eside.
Now that's the idea.	Manje lowo umqondo.
Anyone would.	Noma ubani ngabe.
And now and then, just now.	Futhi manje futhi, manje nje.
So that will be next week.	Ngakho lokho kuzoba ngesonto elizayo.
That's exactly what it really is.	Yilokho impela, impela akusho.
Your chance, he said.	Ithuba lakho, wathi.
That is not a plan.	Lokho akulona icebo.
You always do such a good job.	Uhlala wenza umsebenzi omuhle kangaka.
You probably heard about it.	Mhlawumbe wezwa ngakho.
That's your key.	Yilokho ukhiye wakho.
It's hard but it's okay.	Kunzima kodwa kulungile.
But one just did.	Kodwa omunye wenza nje.
This is a very good story.	Lena indaba enhle kakhulu.
And all that.	Nakho konke lokho.
And this, of course, is how it happened.	Futhi lena, ngempela, indlela okwenzeka ngayo.
We can't play.	Asikwazi ukudlala.
Maybe you need a friend.	Mhlawumbe udinga umngane.
He didn't really know.	Wayengazi ngempela.
But you can control yourself.	Kodwa ungakwazi ukuzibamba.
I have to come to the toilet again.	Kumele ngize futhi endlini encane.
This is my time.	Isikhathi sami lesi.
You feel like giving up something.	Uzizwa ufuna ukuyeka okuthile.
He has been that to all of us.	Ube yilokho kithi sonke.
There, he says.	Lapho, uthi.
He agreed to see you.	Wavuma ukukubona.
He will probably never do it again.	Cishe ngeke aphinde akwenze.
So in my office, and all morning there.	Ngakho ehhovisi lami, futhi ekuseni yonke lapho.
Everything is absolutely true, that's the worst.	Konke kuyiqiniso ngokuphelele, yilokho okubi kakhulu.
But because there is no reason.	Kodwa ngoba asikho isizathu.
Making a decision.	Ukwenza isinqumo.
Well done all week.	Wenze kahle isonto lonke.
We will have to find out why.	Kuzofanele sithole ukuthi kungani.
I'm happy about that, of course.	Ngiyajabula ngalokho, kunjalo.
That will not happen to you.	Lokho ngeke kwenzeke kuwe.
Not just for you.	Hhayi nje ngawe.
He got very close to her.	Wangena kakhulu kuye.
Or at home.	Noma ekhaya.
But in the end, we have to make a choice.	Kodwa ekugcineni, kufanele senze ukukhetha.
I want to.	Ngifuna .
He did not know who that was.	Wayengazi ukuthi kungaba ubani lowo.
So he tried to do something about it.	Ngakho wazama ukwenza okuthile ngakho.
All of this is happening openly.	Konke lokhu kwenzeka ngokusobala.
Lately actually.	Muva nje empeleni.
I know you need to buy another place.	Ngiyazi ukuthi udinga ukuthenga enye indawo.
I'm just happy to have him here.	Ngijabule nje ukuba naye lapha.
You should have said no.	Bekufanele uthi cha.
So that could be a new job for him.	Ngakho lokho kungaba umsebenzi omusha kuye.
I don’t know what’s wrong with my thing.	Angazi ukuthi yini engalungile into yami.
But for me, that is not the case.	Kodwa kimi, akunjalo.
You've been here with him.	Uke waba lapha naye.
I want her too.	Nami ngifuna yena.
I do not see yet.	Angiboni okwamanje.
We need some idea here.	Sidinga umbono othile lapha.
yes, he did.	yebo, wakwenza.
I need some idea.	Ngidinga umbono othile.
He certainly knew better than I did.	Impela yena wayazi kangcono kunami.
He was just amazed, that's all.	Wamangala nje, yilokho kuphela.
This is a great simplification.	Lokhu ukwenza lula okukhulu.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Sekuyisikhathi sokuthi umuntu azi ukuthi wenzeni.
He did not know that he had gone there.	Wayengazi ukuthi uye lapho.
I knew a lot of people.	Ngangazi abantu abaningi.
No, you should not.	Cha, akufanele ukwenze.
I have been beautiful.	Ngibe muhle.
He made your marriage for you.	Wenza umshado wakho ngawe.
He arrived in the afternoon.	Wafika ntambama.
Sometimes, too.	Ngezinye izikhathi, futhi.
But please go now.	Kodwa ngicela uhambe manje.
I would never know why.	Angeke ngazi ukuthi kungani.
Yes, he said yes.	Yebo, wathi yebo.
But this is not always the case, and not always.	Kodwa akunjalo ngaso sonke isikhathi, futhi hhayi ngokuphelele.
We need to be a place.	Kudingeka sibe indawo.
I also did not want to think.	Nami ngangingafuni ukucabanga.
But it is not a system.	Kodwa akulona uhlelo.
Too much.	Kuningi kakhulu .
Something must have happened.	Kumelwe ukuba kukhona okwenzekayo.
Excited, he agreed.	Ejabule, wavuma.
He may know.	Angase azi.
We need something new.	Sidinga into entsha.
And that has been great for us.	Futhi lokho kube kuhle kakhulu kithi.
Or he did, once.	Noma wakwenza, kanye.
It was clear now.	Kwacaca manje.
In your work.	Emsebenzini wakho.
She in her bed.	Yena embhedeni wakhe.
It is better to end it all.	Kungcono ukuqeda konke.
Or, at least, not too much.	Noma, okungenani, hhayi kakhulu.
I will do it anyway.	Ngizokwenza noma kunjalo.
He stayed a long time.	Uhlale isikhathi eside.
You will not know the whole story.	Ngeke wazi yonke indaba.
There is no one else in the room.	Akekho omunye ekamelweni.
You have to go yourself.	Kumele uhambe wena.
Clothes.	Izingubo .
But we should not do that.	Kodwa akufanele senze kanjalo.
Now you .	Manje wena .
There is only one thing.	Kukhona into eyodwa nje .
He can't be.	Angeke abe .
Very sometimes.	Kakhulu ngezinye izikhathi.
Finally he sat down.	Ekugcineni wahlala phansi.
But he refused to have sex with her.	Kodwa wenqaba ukulala naye.
Not this, at least.	Hhayi lokhu, okungenani.
He finally found a restaurant.	Ekugcineni wathola indawo yokudlela.
My performance.	Ukwenza kwami.
It happens every night.	Kwenzeka njalo ebusuku.
Good, just fine.	Kuhle, kuhle nje.
I am his only hope.	Yimina ngedwa ithemba lakhe.
Someone is there.	Umuntu ukhona.
I can't live like that.	Angikwazi ukuphila kanjalo.
I don't think it will be that easy.	Angicabangi ukuthi kuzoba lula kangako.
But life is good.	Kodwa kuhle ukuphila.
But you still do not know what he looks like.	Kodwa namanje awazi ukuthi ubukeka kanjani.
He has never been and never will be.	Akakaze abe khona futhi ngeke abe khona.
I do not want to stay in my room all day.	Angifuni ukuhlala usuku lonke ekamelweni lami.
Not just me.	Hhayi kimi kuphela.
He knows exactly who he saw.	Wazi kahle ukuthi wabona bani.
In the end, you are alone.	Ekugcineni, uwedwa.
Also, living in a big city can be nice.	Futhi, ukuhlala edolobheni elikhulu kungaba kuhle.
My mind works fast.	Umqondo wami usebenza ngokushesha.
Now only my father.	Manje ubaba wami kuphela.
Or you don't have to come.	Noma awudingi ukuza.
This is a must have.	Lokhu kufanele nakanjani ube nakho.
I wish only one thing.	Ngifisa into eyodwa kuphela.
You know it has to happen.	Uyazi kufanele kwenzeke.
It all starts from there.	Konke kuqala kusukela lapho.
And if.	Futhi uma .
I know you did not.	Ngiyazi ukuthi awuzange ukwenze.
John did very well.	UJohn wakwenza kahle kakhulu.
He said he just had to be himself.	Wathi kumele abe nguye nje.
That's right, whatever.	Kunjalo, noma yini.
Question.	Umbuzo .
Instead, it will happen.	Kunalokho, kuzokwenzeka.
If you read one you read both.	Uma ufunda eyodwa ufunda nobabili.
All to you.	Konke kuwe.
Good to know this, thank you.	Kuhle ukwazi lokhu, ngiyabonga.
Only large enough for both.	Kuphela enkulu ngokwanele ukuba bobabili.
Still, no one knows.	Noma kunjalo, akekho owaziyo.
I've always said that, and I think so.	Bengilokhu ngisho njalo, futhi ngicabanga kanjalo.
Too much, in fact.	Kuningi kakhulu, empeleni.
Now you can do that very easily.	Manje ungakwenza lokho kalula kakhulu.
You need to come here.	Udinga ukuza lapha.
He did a little bit of that.	Ukwenze kancane lokho.
It has to happen here.	Kufanele kwenzeke lapha.
And you need to make a quick choice.	Futhi udinga ukukhetha ngokushesha.
That he is.	Ukuthi nguye.
Great big thing.	Into enkulu enkulu.
It is not a mistake, not entirely.	Akulona iphutha, hhayi ngokuphelele.
I live very much alone.	Ngihlala ngedwa kakhulu.
You know! 	Uyazi!
He told me all this later.	Wangitshela konke lokhu kamuva.
I want it all to happen right now.	Ngifuna ukuthi konke kwenzeke njengamanje.
And so to.	Futhi kanjalo ukuze.
I probably will not know.	Cishe ngeke ngazi.
He got in the way.	Wangena indlela.
I thought mine.	Ngacabanga wami.
I would like to say something right away.	Ngingathanda ukusho okuthile ngaso leso sikhathi.
But no one thinks about that.	Kodwa akekho ocabanga ngalokho.
If you do, that's fine.	Uma wenze kanjalo, kuhle.
I'm not sure you will be human.	Angiqiniseki ukuthi uzobe ungumuntu.
You, me and him.	Wena, mina naye.
Anyone else had to sit in the back.	Noma ubani omunye kwakufanele ahlale ngemuva.
But he did not stay there long.	Kodwa akazange ahlale isikhathi eside lapho.
He rarely goes to town.	Akavamile ukuya edolobheni.
He is all asleep.	Ulele wonke.
But not too much.	Kodwa hhayi okuningi kakhulu.
But not so with me.	Kodwa akunjalo kimi.
Maybe okay.	Mhlawumbe kulungile.
Maybe you're trying to control yourself.	Mhlawumbe uzama ukuzibamba.
But it will take a while.	Kodwa kuzothatha isikhashana.
And he also knows.	Futhi naye uyazi.
Sometimes, there are more here than just me.	Ngezinye izikhathi, kukhona abaningi lapha kunami nje.
That’s why this is hard for me.	Yingakho lokhu kunzima kimi.
Just you and me, really.	Mina nawe nje, ngempela.
He says he needs your help.	Uthi udinga usizo lwakho.
Actually, that is not my question.	Empeleni, lowo akuwona umbuzo wami.
Now that's right.	Manje kunjalo.
He just wants to do it.	Ufuna nje ukukwenza.
He has to do it, and now.	Kufanele enze, futhi manje.
At that moment he said.	Ngaleso sikhathi wathi .
Mother voice.	Umama izwi.
But, if that should be a big question.	Kodwa, uma kufanele kube umbuzo omkhulu.
One doctor says one thing, another doctor another.	Omunye udokotela usho into eyodwa, omunye udokotela okunye.
I know you don't want to do this to me.	Ngiyazi ukuthi awufuni ukwenza lokhu kimi.
There will be more people.	Kuzoba abantu abaningi.
What every teacher should know.	Okufanele wonke uthisha akwazi.
I have to go anyway.	Kufanele ngihambe noma kunjalo.
I mean you're wrong.	Ngisho ukuthi unephutha.
That will be very helpful.	Lokho kuzoba usizo kakhulu.
Even every day.	Ngisho nsuku zonke.
And he has to come first.	Futhi kufanele eze kuqala.
And that seems right to me.	Futhi lokho kubonakala kulungile kimi.
At least, not tonight.	Okungenani, hhayi namuhla ebusuku.
Her family is beautiful.	Muhle umndeni wakhe.
I look good.	Ngibukeka kahle.
But what happens when you.	Kodwa kwenzekani uma wena.
But this only happens sometimes and at night.	Kodwa lokhu kwenzeka kuphela ngezinye izikhathi futhi ebusuku.
Tomorrow, yes, but not today.	Kusasa, yebo, kodwa hhayi namuhla.
He just talks when he gets to the door.	Ukhuluma nje uma efika emnyango.
But there is someone else there.	Kodwa kukhona omunye lapho.
This is not good.	Hhayi kuhle lokhu.
Sometimes things have to.	Ngezinye izikhathi izinto kufanele.
I just want something big.	Ngifuna into enkulu nje.
They say it's true.	Bathi kuyiqiniso.
Not the teacher.	Hhayi uthisha.
Or maybe you just felt that way.	Noma mhlawumbe wazizwa kanjalo.
I will never see anyone again.	Angeke ngiphinde ngibone muntu.
Good time again.	Isikhathi esihle futhi.
He goes home immediately.	Uya ekhaya ngokushesha.
I can't say such a thing.	Angikwazi ukusho into enjalo.
He took a breath.	Wathatha umoya.
Good down here.	Kuhle lapha phansi.
I wonder this.	Kazi lokhu .
He hoped he would go.	Wayenethemba lokuthi uzohamba.
This is our life now.	Lena impilo yethu manje.
Or get a job.	Noma uthole umsebenzi.
Reading is hard.	Ukufunda kunzima.
He knew it was time.	Wayazi ukuthi sekuyisikhathi.
Easy to cook.	Ukupheka kalula.
Maybe a gun.	Mhlawumbe isibhamu.
He’s not the best either.	Akuyena ongcono kakhulu noma cha.
We should not do that.	Akufanele sikwenze lokho.
I too could not hold back.	Nami angikwazanga ukuzibamba.
I will go.	Ngizohamba .
But there is nothing to be done about it here.	Kodwa akukho okumele kwenziwe ngalokho lapha.
If so, you have to make a decision.	Uma kunjalo, kufanele wenze isinqumo.
It could happen again now.	Kungenzeka futhi manje.
I never thought it would be so easy.	Ngangingacabangi ukuthi kuzoba lula kangako.
I can no longer work.	Angisakwazi ukusebenza.
I did not hear any noise.	Angizange ngizwe umsindo.
And now there you are, of course.	Futhi manje kukhona wena, kunjalo.
It will not happen at all.	Angeke kwenzeke nhlobo.
Not because you have to, but because you want to.	Hhayi ngoba kufanele, kodwa ngoba ufuna.
You just.	Usanda .
Very clear, very obvious.	Kusobala kakhulu, kusobala kakhulu.
He decided to drive to the hospital later.	Wanquma ukushayela esibhedlela kamuva.
And he went with him.	Futhi wahamba naye.
For us, to him.	Kithi, kuye.
Should it be either.	Ingabe kufanele kube noma.
And he was not really a human being.	Futhi kwakungeyena ngempela umuntu.
He seemed to be doing everything a little bit.	Wayebonakala enza yonke into kancane.
No, not at all.	Cha, akunjalo neze.
I think we made a mistake there.	Ngicabanga ukuthi senze iphutha lapho.
A few things appear in this regard.	Kulokhu kubonakala izinto ezimbalwa.
I have to wait another week.	Kuzomele ngilinde elinye isonto.
We got three.	Sithole ezintathu.
Well and everything.	Kahle nakho konke.
The only problem is his age.	Inkinga nje iminyaka yakhe.
Because of him.	Ngenxa yakhe .
Do not forget that he also suffers as you do.	Ungakhohlwa ukuthi naye ubuhlungu njengawe.
I probably need to get out of here anyway.	Cishe ngidinga ukuphuma lapha noma kunjalo.
So it's not really new.	Ngakho akuyona into entsha ngempela.
My mother did not.	Umama akazange.
He must have wanted to talk to her.	Kumelwe ukuba wayefuna ngempela ukukhuluma naye.
He did that regularly and well.	Wenza lokho njalo futhi kahle.
You should never do it this way.	Akufanele neze ukwenze ngale ndlela.
But there is more to do.	Kodwa kuningi okufanele sikwenze.
It would be easy to die.	Kungaba lula ukufa.
I had to do it all.	Kwakufanele ngikwenze konke.
He can sing.	Angakwazi ukucula.
Feeling no, yes and no.	Ukuzwa hhayi, yebo futhi cha.
And there is no time today.	Futhi asikho isikhathi namuhla.
I can't wait any longer.	Nami angisakwazi ukulinda.
A child where there should be no child.	Ingane lapho kwakungafanele kube khona ingane.
Everything was easy, in the end.	Konke kube lula, ekugcineni.
I thought though.	Ngicabange kodwa.
I had to stay in the hospital.	Bekufanele ngihlale esibhedlela.
He hasn't been able to do it yet.	Akakwazanga ukukwenza okwamanje.
Sure, you got one.	Impela, uthole eyodwa.
And he is very happy about her.	Futhi ujabule kakhulu ngaye.
This is just true.	Lokhu kuyiqiniso nje.
I would not go anywhere here.	Bengingeke ngiye ndawo lapha.
She was very well dressed.	Wayegqoke kahle kakhulu.
And to do this.	Futhi ukuze wenze lokhu.
He works so hard.	Usebenza kanzima kangaka.
Dad just wanted to make his life better.	Ubaba wayefuna nje ukwenza ukuphila kwakhe kube ngcono.
He said because of her.	Wathi ngenxa yakhe.
I think that's my name.	Ngicabanga ukuthi igama lami lelo.
If you would like to be tested.	Uma ungathanda ukuhlolwa.
One.	Omunye .
At least not only that.	Okungenani hhayi kuphela.
I would really like to buy one.	Ngingathanda ngempela ukuthenga eyodwa.
As it is, not in the world.	Njengoba kunjalo, hhayi emhlabeni.
Or another job.	Noma omunye umsebenzi.
But it is true what happened to us.	Kodwa kuyiqiniso lokho okwenzeka kithi.
He may be.	Angase abe .
Why he.	Kungani yena .
Not next week.	Hhayi ngesonto elizayo.
This may just be.	Lokhu kungase kube nje.
Before you can do that.	Ngaphambi kokuthi ukwazi ukwenza lokho.
My family is very happy.	Umndeni wami ujabule kakhulu.
Almost everyone is here.	Cishe wonke umuntu ulapha.
Unless you probably said yes.	Ngaphandle uma mhlawumbe uthe yebo.
I need to think, not talk.	Ngidinga ukucabanga, hhayi ukukhuluma.
But he was also afraid.	Kodwa futhi wayesaba.
You were not well.	Awuzange ube kahle.
He will not help us.	Ngeke asisize.
Stop playing a bit.	Yeka ukudlala kancane.
You are right.	Usho iqiniso.
I need to see you, too.	Ngidinga ukukubona, nami.
Just a program, he thought.	Uhlelo nje, wacabanga.
So he tried.	Ngakho wazama.
I need more.	Ngidinga okunye .
Hope to see everyone there.	Ngethemba ukubona wonke umuntu lapho.
He should be able to do that.	Kufanele akwazi ukwenza lokho.
He won't tell me anything.	Ngeke angitshele lutho.
All of this did not happen.	Konke lokhu akuzange kwenzeke.
That we will not do.	Lokho ngeke sikwenze.
But to simplify it all.	Kodwa ukwenza lula konke.
It is difficult, but possible.	Kunzima, kodwa kungenzeka.
Stop logging in.	Yeka ukungena.
Maybe good that it should be.	Mhlawumbe kuhle ukuthi kufanele kube.
But this is nothing new.	Kodwa lokhu akuyona into entsha.
I did it at home a lot of the time.	Ngikwenze ekhaya isikhathi esiningi.
Is it possible that you did something.	Kungenzeka yini ukuthi wenze okuthile.
My friend was wearing the same thing.	Umngane wami wayegqoke into efanayo.
And it should not be so.	Futhi akufanele kube kanjalo.
Maybe someone did.	Mhlawumbe omunye wenza.
You can't sing lying on the floor.	Awukwazi ukucula ulele phansi.
Not yet, and not now.	Hhayi okwamanje, futhi hhayi manje.
He will not say why.	Ngeke asho ukuthi kungani.
I wanted to know about everything there.	Ngangifuna ukwazi ngayo yonke into lapho.
Still, he handed over his excellent shotgun.	Noma kunjalo, wanikeza isibhamu sakhe esihle kakhulu.
But that is not your fault.	Kodwa lokho akulona neze icala lakho.
But this we cannot.	Kodwa lokhu asikwazi.
You will need to do this alone.	Kuzodingeka wenze lokhu uwedwa.
You really need help.	Udinga usizo ngempela.
So you have to be there.	Ngakho kufanele ube lapho.
The problem is that you can't say that.	Inkinga ukuthi awukwazi ukusho lokho.
But better, of course.	Kodwa kungcono, kunjalo.
It should be easy to fix.	Kufanele kube lula ukulungisa.
My opinion is my opinion.	Umbono wami umbono wami.
Very bad response.	Impendulo embi kakhulu.
But this is not me.	Kodwa lokhu akumina.
You think? 	Ucabanga kanjalo?
He wanted someone else.	Wayefuna omunye umuntu.
And just playing all day.	Futhi nje ukudlala usuku lonke.
He did not know what to do.	Wayengazi ukuthi kufanele enzeni.
What is happening now.	Yeka okwenzekayo manje.
And it doesn't have to be this way.	Futhi akudingeki kube njalo.
That's a good idea too.	Umqondo omuhle lowo futhi.
You want to know.	Ufuna ukwazi.
Only he does not know.	Kuphela yena akazi.
That has been long enough.	Sekuyisikhathi eside ngokwanele lokho.
Here I am, in his place.	Ngilapha, endaweni yakhe.
It all starts tomorrow.	Konke kuqala kusasa.
You never said much, so you never knew much about him.	Awukaze usho okuningi, ngakho awukaze wazi okuningi ngaye.
In this, you have done a very good thing.	Kulokhu, wenze into enhle kakhulu.
There is no need for you there.	Asikho isidingo sakho lapho.
Let me tell you now.	Ngikutshele manje.
That's the only bad thing.	Yilokho kuphela okubi.
If you do not.	Uma ungakwenzi .
I do it all the time.	Ngenza ngaso sonke isikhathi.
Or to be.	Noma ukuba.
You could not say better.	Ubungeke ukusho kangcono.
Unless we do.	Ngaphandle uma senza.
One question was this.	Omunye umbuzo waba kanje.
More about that yet.	Okuningi ngalokho okwamanje.
This is the right move.	Lokhu ukuhamba ngendlela efanele.
I couldn't do more, yet.	Angikwazanga ukwenza okwengeziwe, okwamanje.
This is much better.	Kungcono kakhulu lokhu.
Only at the beginning.	Ekuqaleni kuphela.
He had to stop walking.	Kwadingeka ayeke ukuhamba.
Everything should be fine.	Konke kufanele kube kuhle.
Breathing air.	Ukuphuza umoya.
We do a good job here.	Senza umsebenzi omuhle lapha.
It's hard to feel such a thing.	Kunzima ukuzwa into enjalo.
First, she goes to the hospital.	Okokuqala, uya esibhedlela.
And he did nothing later.	Futhi akazange enze lutho ngemva .
I'm not sure which one.	Angiqiniseki ukuthi iyiphi.
Now in that case.	Manje kulokho okwenzekayo.
Once in a while, or all at once.	Kanye ngesikhathi, noma konke ngesikhathi esisodwa.
Not all questions.	Akuyona yonke imibuzo.
Maybe, or maybe not.	Mhlawumbe, noma mhlawumbe cha.
I will have to do this alone.	Kuzofanele ngikwenze lokhu ngedwa.
At the time they said it meant nothing.	Ngaleso sikhathi bathi akusho lutho.
I have to wait a while.	Kufanele ngilinde isikhashana.
Sometimes a week.	Ngezinye izikhathi ngesonto.
I wanted hope.	Ngangifuna ithemba.
We do everything with him.	Senza konke naye.
It will always be necessary.	Kuzodingeka njalo.
Sounds very good to me.	Kuzwakala kuhle kakhulu kimi.
No, he should not think that way.	Cha, akumele acabange kanjalo.
My father used to say that.	Ubaba wayevame ukusho lokho.
You have to do a very good job.	Kufanele wenze umsebenzi omuhle kakhulu.
And what a program.	Futhi yeka uhlelo.
Now food.	Manje ukudla.
Or maybe a piano.	Noma mhlawumbe upiyano.
He made her unable to stay.	Wenza ukuba angakwazi ukuhlala.
And his family will not.	Nomndeni wakhe ngeke.
There are no questions about it.	Ayikho imibuzo ngakho.
I don’t think so, though.	Angicabangi kanjalo, noma kunjalo.
Three hours talking.	Amahora amathathu ekhuluma.
We can't waste time.	Asikwazi ukuchitha isikhathi.
You have to do better.	Kumele wenze kangcono.
You know, something new.	Uyazi, into entsha.
Something else has happened, too.	Kukhona okunye okwenzekile, futhi.
He did not want to hear what she had to say.	Wayengafuni ukuzwa ukuthi uthini.
But there is something about him.	Kodwa kukhona okuthile ngaye.
My father told me.	Ubaba wangitshela.
Just like that.	Njengoba nje kanjalo.
Without you, you will not go anywhere.	Ngaphandle kwakho, ngeke uye ndawo.
Much has been good.	Okuningi kube kuhle.
Police just work.	Amaphoyisa ukusebenza nje.
I could not really stop.	Angikwazanga ngempela ukuyeka.
He also did not want to leave.	Naye wayengafuni ukuhamba.
I need to do something more.	Ngidinga ukwenza okunye okwengeziwe.
Maybe he should have done more.	Mhlawumbe bekufanele enze izinto eziningi.
You know who really needed to be there.	Uyazi ukuthi ubani okwakudingeka ngempela abe lapho.
I have never done anything, I will not.	Angikaze ngenze lutho, ngeke.
He just got one big thing.	Wavele wathola into enkulu eyodwa.
I have to think that too.	Nami kufanele ngicabange kanjalo.
Things to him.	Izinto kuye.
Maybe not there.	Mhlawumbe akukho lapho.
So yes, that's fine.	Ngakho yebo, kulungile.
You know it will be difficult.	Uyazi ukuthi kuzoba nzima.
He has been doing this all day long.	Ubelokhu enza kanje usuku lonke.
But this is not a bad thing at all.	Kodwa lokhu akuyona into embi ngempela.
Not that, not now.	Hhayi lokho, hhayi manje.
But he can't help but want to know a little bit.	Kodwa akakwazi ukuzibamba efuna ukwazi kancane.
You've heard of me.	Uke wezwa ngami.
My mother did not do that.	Umama akazange akwenze lokho.
This should never have happened.	Lokhu bekungafanele neze kwenzeke.
Not in the same way.	Hhayi ngendlela efanayo.
I'm not sure how.	Angazi kanjani kahle.
That could be months.	Lokho kungaba izinyanga.
Did he want to do it again.	Ingabe wayefuna ukukwenza futhi.
Nobody wants to be there right now.	Akekho ofuna ukuba lapho njengamanje.
This would be a really good idea.	Lokhu kungaba umqondo omuhle ngempela.
Maybe there will be people.	Mhlawumbe kuzoba khona abantu.
It could be, though.	Kungenzeka, noma kunjalo.
And he always talks.	Futhi uhlala ekhuluma.
I never, never.	Angikaze, angikaze.
I know, I know.	Ngiyazi, ngiyazi.
And if that is going to happen.	Futhi uma lokho kuzokwenzeka.
This is something he cannot do.	Lena into angeke akwazi ukuyenza.
Everything is clear now, that sounds better.	Konke kusobala manje, lokho kuzwakala kungcono.
Good for school.	Kuhle esikoleni.
I could see that she too was worried.	Ngabona ukuthi naye ukhathazekile.
Everyone wants to stop.	Wonke umuntu ufuna ukuthi ayeke.
I do my homework.	Ngenza umsebenzi wami wesikole.
He did not want her to talk.	Wayengafuni ukuthi akhulume.
Not just last year.	Hhayi nje ngonyaka odlule.
Or alone.	Noma eyedwa.
You have to find out which one.	Kufanele uthole ukuthi iyiphi.
You want to do more.	Ufuna ukwenza okwengeziwe.
We had to leave for a few days.	Kwadingeka sihambe izinsuku ezimbalwa.
You will get better there.	Uzoba ngcono lapho.
I did a little to help.	Ngenza kancane ukusiza.
I thought about this for a long time and hard.	Ngicabange ngalokhu isikhathi eside futhi kanzima.
Now there is only one.	Manje kukhona eyodwa kuphela.
Alone.	Ngedwa .
We do as we should.	Senza njengoba kufanele.
He must tell the police.	Kumele atshele amaphoyisa.
To do such a thing.	Ukwenza into enjalo.
It looks like that on the outside.	Kubukeka kanjalo ngaphandle.
But now, he did not know what to do.	Kodwa manje, wayengazi ukuthi enzeni.
You should be here now.	Bekufanele ngabe ulapha manje.
This is our life here.	Lena impilo yethu lapha.
He wasn't even at the table.	Wayengekho ngisho etafuleni.
And here he saw a great opportunity.	Futhi lapha wabona ithuba elikhulu.
I'm sure that's not true.	Ngiqinisekile ukuthi akulona iqiniso.
It is very difficult for me to do anything.	Kunzima kakhulu kimi ukwenza noma yini.
We just want to hear the answer.	Sifuna nje ukuzwa impendulo.
Power is not everything.	Amandla ayikho konke.
He wanted to say something and nothing.	Wayefuna ukusho okuthile futhi lutho.
I thought it was going to be hard.	Bengicabanga ukuthi kuzoba nzima.
But that probably sounds right.	Kodwa lokho cishe kuzwakala kulungile.
That something is wrong.	Ukuthi kukhona okubi.
Everyone can make a mistake.	Wonke umuntu angenza iphutha.
I just sit there.	Ngihlale nje.
So far, no one.	Kuze kube manje, akekho.
He knew how to do it.	Wayazi indlela yokwenza.
Finally, he asked questions.	Ekugcineni, wabuza imibuzo.
Everything here at home.	Konke lapha ekhaya.
If you do not do this.	Uma ungakwenzi lokhu.
You know, hearing a car.	Uyazi, ukuzwa imoto.
But a doctor.	Kodwa udokotela.
I have to talk to you today.	Kufanele ngikhulume nawe namuhla.
He has to tell.	Kuzomele atshele.
Not a bad thing at all.	Akuyona into embi impela.
But he still stayed there.	Kodwa noma kunjalo wahlala lapho.
You want to hear.	Ufuna ukuzwa.
Or if you walk slowly.	Noma uma uhamba kancane kancane.
He wanted to do the right thing.	Wayefuna ukwenza into efanele.
Yes he can do anything.	Yebo angenza noma yini.
It can't be this one.	Ngeke kube nguye lo.
Or your age.	Noma iminyaka yakho.
Or at least he did not.	Noma okungenani akazange.
But one has to make a decision.	Kodwa umuntu kufanele enze isinqumo.
I try to help a friend.	Ngizama ukusiza umngane.
He has done so all my life.	Wenze njalo impilo yami yonke.
You're my baby, you know.	Uyingane yami, uyazi.
And actually, that's exactly right.	Futhi empeleni, kunjalo impela.
But you want to make a lot of money quickly.	Kodwa ufuna ukwenza imali eningi ngokushesha.
Thank you for that, too.	Ngiyabonga ngalokho, futhi.
Hopefully, we did.	Ngethemba, senze.
It is not your fault that you did not know better.	Akulona iphutha lakho ukuthi ubungazi kangcono.
My father knew.	Ubaba wayazi.
But there is no danger.	Kodwa ayikho ingozi.
You never said anything.	Awukaze usho lutho.
To you alone.	Kuwe wedwa.
And it's great to be in the middle.	Futhi kuhle kakhulu ukuba phakathi.
This is bad advice.	Iseluleko esibi lesi.
You have to get dressed and go now.	Kuzomele ugqoke uhambe manje.
Something had to be done about it.	Kwakufanele kwenziwe okuthile ngakho.
This, of course, is not the case.	Lokhu, kunjalo, akukhona okwenzekayo.
No, not now, not later.	Cha, hhayi manje, kamuva.
Sounds like it isn't.	Kuzwakala sengathi akunjalo.
I never really talked to him.	Angizange ngikhulume naye ngempela.
This is something he will not do.	Lena into angeke ayenze.
But he could not even do that.	Kodwa akakwazanga ngisho ukukwenza lokho.
He was not here.	Wayengekho lapha.
I don't see why it should.	Angiboni ukuthi kungani kufanele.
Yes, definitely next week.	Yebo, nakanjani ngesonto elizayo.
I mean, no.	Ngisho, akukho.
He does a lot of time.	Wenza isikhathi esiningi.
How tall.	Mude kangakanani.
He said that meant nothing.	Wathi lokho akusho lutho.
Obviously that is not true.	Ngokusobala lokho akulona iqiniso.
She's a little, little baby.	Uyingane encane, encane.
He could not do anything right now.	Akakwazanga ukwenza lutho njengamanje.
I know you are thinking of doing it.	Ngiyazi ukuthi ucabanga ukukwenza.
I just love that look.	Ngithanda nje lokho kubukeka.
But he could not sleep for long.	Kodwa akakwazanga ukulala isikhathi eside.
That is my excellent advice.	Leso iseluleko sami esihle kakhulu.
And not tomorrow.	Futhi hhayi kusasa.
I want to be me and no one else.	Ngifuna ukuba yimi hhayi omunye umuntu.
As it happened, that never happened to me.	Njengoba kwenzeka, lokho akuzange kwenzeke kimi.
He could not tell the truth.	Wayengeke akhulume iqiniso.
Let's build this.	Ake sakhe lokhu.
If true, that's fine.	Uma kuyiqiniso, kuhle kakhulu.
Maybe he is and he never told me.	Mhlawumbe ukhona futhi akakaze angitshele.
I just can't, like, take a phone call with you.	Angikwazi nje, sengathi, ukuthatha ucingo nawe.
Everyone should read this book.	Wonke umuntu kufanele afunde le ncwadi.
I don't want it to happen.	angifuni kwenzeke.
I do not want to die.	angifuni ukufa.
I would not have thought of it.	Bengingeke ngicabange ngakho.
In the summer, it happens almost every day.	Ehlobo, kwenzeka cishe nsuku zonke.
Of course he had no idea about this at all.	Yebo wayengazi nhlobo ngalokhu.
He thought the meeting went well.	Wayecabanga ukuthi umhlangano uhambe kahle.
There is, rather, a continuation.	Kukhona, kunalokho, ukuqhubeka.
I need a lot of time on it, of course.	Ngidinga isikhathi esiningi kukho, kunjalo.
It looks much better now.	Kubukeka kungcono kakhulu manje.
Maybe not next year.	Mhlawumbe hhayi ngonyaka ozayo.
And find someone better.	Futhi uthole umuntu ongcono.
Whatever that may be.	Noma ngabe lokho kungaba yini.
If you did.	Uma wenze.
My mother lives with us.	Umama uhlala nathi.
Everything seems to us in a new way.	Konke kubonakala kithi ngendlela entsha.

It's just evening.	Kusihlwa nje.
Why exactly, he could not say.	Ukuthi kungani ngempela, akakwazanga ukusho.
But this, this.	Kodwa lokhu, lokhu.
To this day, it is.	Kuze kube namuhla, kunjalo.
He may think he can, but he can.	Angase acabange ukuthi angakwazi, kodwa angakwazi.
This is not a problem for me.	Lokhu akuyona inkinga kimi.
To put it bluntly.	Ukusho kahle kabi lokho.
There is always one.	Kukhona njalo eyodwa.
I would like to see your location.	Ngingathanda ukubona indawo yakho.
Because anything is possible.	Ngoba kungenzeka noma yini.
He was not thinking about this at the time.	Wayengacabangi lutho ngalokhu ngaleso sikhathi.
I hope he can.	Ngethemba ukuthi angakwazi.
Unless he seems to be able to.	Ngaphandle kokuthi kubonakala sengathi akakwazi.
You go to school now and you like this a lot.	Uya esikoleni manje futhi uthanda lokhu kakhulu.
All right, good enough.	Kulungile, kulungile ngokwanele.
Maybe you go too far.	Mhlawumbe uhamba kakhulu.
And there is a very big house.	Futhi kukhona indlu enkulu kakhulu.
Neither can we.	Nathi angeke.
I am very sorry for everything.	Ngiyaxolisa kakhulu ngakho konke.
Good work here, too.	Umsebenzi omuhle lapha, futhi.
This happens a lot too.	Lokhu kwenzeka kakhulu futhi.
Not three hours.	Hhayi amahora amathathu.
Not always, but yes, sometimes.	Hhayi njalo, kodwa yebo, ngezinye izikhathi.
This seems true enough, if only a little obvious.	Lokhu kubonakala kuyiqiniso ngokwanele, uma kusobala kancane.
He could not continue this.	Akakwazanga ukuqhubeka nalokhu.
I need money anyway.	Ngidinga imali noma kunjalo.
Let me go with you.	Ake ngihambe nawe.
He did not arrive in the afternoon.	Akazange afike ntambama.
You don't have to get into that.	Akudingekile ukungena kulokho.
I have always been able to do that.	Bengilokhu ngikwazi ukwenza lokho.
He did not want to hear anything from her.	Wayengafuni ukuzwa lutho kuye.
It eventually happened to all of us.	Ekugcineni kwenzeka kithi sonke.
I never thought it would be like this.	Angikaze ngicabange ukuthi kuzoba kanje.
This is going to be hard enough.	Lokhu kuzoba nzima ngokwanele.
I would never.	Bengingeke neze.
Not everyone will do that.	Hhayi ukuthi wonke umuntu uzokwenza lokho.
We can't think of anything else.	Asikwazi ukucabanga okunye.
The teacher is currently studying at work.	Njengamanje uthisha ufunda emsebenzini.
But you look like you did it wrong.	Kodwa ubukeka sengathi wenza kabi.
Some of you are possible.	Okunye kwakho kungenzeka.
I could see that she felt the same way.	Ngabona ukuthi naye uzizwa ngendlela efanayo.
At night.	Ebusuku .
She pretends to be very happy.	Wenza sengathi ujabule kakhulu.
Maybe right there.	Mhlawumbe khona lapho.
He wanted to say something.	Wayefuna ukusho okuthile.
Why here? 	Kungani lapha?
Not always, at least.	Hhayi njalo, okungenani.
I'd like to talk to you.	Ngithanda ukukhuluma nawe.
Just a little sleep.	Ukulala kancane nje.
I know it will be difficult.	Ngiyazi kuzoba nzima.
And sometimes for too long.	Futhi ngezinye izikhathi isikhathi eside kakhulu.
He expects you to do that.	Ulindele ukuthi wenze lokho.
Only her friend.	Umngane wakhe kuphela.
It deserves nothing.	Akufanele lutho.
Maybe not today and maybe not tomorrow, but soon.	Mhlawumbe hhayi namuhla futhi mhlawumbe hhayi kusasa, kodwa maduze.
This also happens a lot.	Lokhu nakho kwenzeka kakhulu.
You cannot do it all by yourself.	Ngeke ukwenze konke uwedwa.
Maybe a story there.	Mhlawumbe indaba lapho.
He just went and did it.	Wavele wahamba wakwenza.
But many.	Kodwa abaningi.
But later it will not.	Kodwa kamuva ngeke.
I like a beautiful picture.	Ngithanda isithombe esihle.
We need to see a great plan.	Sidinga ukubona icebo elikhulu.
You can always find a new car.	Ungakwazi njalo ukuthola imoto entsha.
No, not another.	Hhayi, hhayi omunye.
Or you can talk about it.	Noma ukwazi ukukhuluma ngakho.
One more thing.	Enye into enye.
Not that it always happens.	Hhayi ukuthi kwenzeka njalo.
There’s a lot more, obviously.	Kuningi okwengeziwe, ngokusobala.
If it has to happen, it will happen.	Uma kufanele kwenzeke, kuzokwenzeka.
This had to be done.	Lokhu kwakudingeka kwenziwe.
Maybe, you know.	Mhlawumbe, uyazi.
This time, he stayed for a week.	Kulokhu, wahlala isonto lonke.
And to do really well.	Futhi ukwenza kahle ngempela.
He looked at things.	Wabheka izinto.
That's the problem, really.	Yilokho inkinga, ngempela.
Pretend you are asleep.	Enza sengathi ulele.
From the beginning down.	Kusukela ekuqaleni phansi.
And it will just be that.	Futhi kuzoba yilokho nje.
I just need to think about my job.	Ngidinga nje ukucabanga ngomsebenzi wami.
I just need to know.	Ngidinga nje ukwazi.
He looked everywhere but down.	Wabheka yonke indawo kodwa phansi.
He only knew it was true.	Wayazi kuphela ukuthi kuyiqiniso.
We should be friends.	Kufanele sibe abangani.
I tried to get him to go with me.	Ngazama ukuthi ahambe nami.
He did not want to.	Wayengafuni .
You just look so alone.	Ubukeka wedwa nje.
No, he is not.	Cha, akekho.
But you should know a few things.	Kodwa kufanele wazi izinto ezimbalwa.
And that's fine, because it really isn't.	Futhi lokho kuhle, ngoba ngempela akunjalo.
Really, I want to take this job.	Ngempela, ngifuna ukuthatha lo msebenzi.
I think that's the problem.	Ngicabanga ukuthi inkinga.
It's not you and me.	Asikho mina nawe.
We cannot see everything at once.	Asikwazi ukubona yonke into ngesikhathi esisodwa.
I can't sleep next to him.	Angikwazi ukulala eduze kwakhe.
But this is by no means the case.	Kodwa lokhu akukhona neze okwenzekayo.
Mostly because.	Kakhulu ngoba.
I did not see anyone else all the time.	Angizange ngibone omunye umuntu ngaso sonke isikhathi.
His job is to get pictures only.	Umsebenzi wakhe ukuthola izithombe kuphela.
He has made his job easier.	Wenze umsebenzi wakhe waba lula.
He probably never said anything.	Cishe akakaze asho lutho.
Maybe you're thinking about him now.	Mhlawumbe ucabanga ngaye manje.
He did not want to waste time.	Wayengafuni ukuchitha isikhathi.
What do you say.	Uthini wena.
Sometimes it happens.	Ngezinye izikhathi kwenzeka.
It can only be.	Kungaba nakho kuphela.
That he should win.	Ukuthi kufanele awine.
Sitting in the back.	Ehlala ngemuva.
Just tell me you'll be there.	Ngitshele nje uzoba lapho.
Everything is not your fault.	Konke akulona iphutha lakho.
But this one can.	Kodwa lo angakwazi.
There is no one but him.	Akukho muntu ngaphandle kwakhe.
He could do nothing about it.	Akakwazanga ukwenza lutho ngalokho.
You did a good job of doing that.	Wenza umsebenzi omuhle ngokwenza lokho.
We need to do more.	Kufanele senze okwengeziwe.
I think it's really good.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kuhle impela.
This is the way to go.	Lena indlela okufanele uhambe ngayo.
That's right from the beginning.	Kunjalo kusukela ekuqaleni.
But it is very good there.	Kodwa kuhle kakhulu lapho.
That could be his life too.	Lokho kungaba impilo yakhe futhi.
The only question is how bad you are.	Umbuzo nje ukuthi uzokwenza kabi kangakanani.
At first he knew nothing.	Ekuqaleni wayengazi lutho.
He pulled out a book.	Wakhipha incwadi.
It's up to you, of course.	Kuze kuwe, kunjalo.
He came in and knew right away.	Wangena wayazi ngaso leso sikhathi.
Still, it is very good.	Noma kunjalo, kuhle kakhulu.
Only place, really.	Indawo kuphela, ngempela.
You can't, for now.	Angeke, okwamanje.
I think so, yes.	Ngicabanga kanjalo, yebo.
You just have to go through it.	Kufanele nje uhambe ngakho.
You are always alone.	Uwedwa njalo.
There will be a case.	Kuzoba khona icala.
That's what it should be.	Yilokho okumele.
Even if you do what you have to do.	Noma ngabe wenza okufanele ukwenze.
And another message.	Futhi omunye umlayezo.
Maybe or not.	Mhlawumbe noma cha.
Extra time.	Isikhathi esengeziwe.
Or last night.	Noma izolo ebusuku.
But it should definitely.	Kodwa kufanele nakanjani.
Yes, indeed.	Yebo, nguye ngempela.
Anything in between.	Noma yini phakathi.
No, no, you will soon be out.	Cha, cha, uzofika maduze nje.
Still, I can't wait to see you.	Noma kunjalo, angisakwazi ukulinda ukukubona.
I will do this again and again and again.	Ngizokwenza lokhu futhi futhi futhi futhi futhi.
Yes, that could be the way to come.	Yebo, lokho kungase kube indlela ezayo.
How, he didn't know.	Kanjani, wayengazi.
He always knew.	Wayazi njalo.
I got one coming tomorrow.	Ngithole enye ezayo kusasa.
He did all he could.	Wenze konke angakwenza.
That's not the way it really is.	Akuyona indlela ngempela leyo.
He wanted to leave, immediately.	Wayefuna ukuhamba, ngokushesha.
Probably my fault.	Cishe iphutha lami.
Not that he can do much right now.	Hhayi ukuthi kuningi angakwenza okwamanje.
It must be very difficult for you.	Kumele kube nzima kakhulu kuwe.
That is not just our opinion.	Lokho akuwona nje umbono wethu.
I can't find your fix.	Angikwazi ukuthola ukulungisa kwakho.
I do not remember exactly when.	Angisakhumbuli kahle ukuthi nini.
And that's several times a year.	Futhi lokho izikhathi eziningi ngonyaka.
Indeed, for a long time.	Ngempela, isikhathi eside.
He knew he could not live alone.	Wayazi ukuthi wayengeke akwazi ukuhlala yedwa.
She is worried and waiting.	Ukhathazekile futhi ulindele.
He may or may not.	Angase noma angeke.
But it happened to me anyway.	Kodwa kwenzeka kimi noma kunjalo.
You can do that today if you like.	Ungakwenza lokho namuhla uma uthanda.
I want to work, but not as you think.	Ngifuna ukusebenza, kodwa hhayi njengoba ucabanga.
Or, maybe not.	Noma, mhlawumbe akunjalo.
Because you would like to get a job.	Ngoba ungathanda ukuthola umsebenzi.
But his eyes mean everything.	Kodwa amehlo akhe asho konke.
That too is not necessary.	Lokho futhi akudingekile.
You may have to do this many times.	Kungase kudingeke ukuba wenze lokhu izikhathi eziningi.
But only in time.	Kodwa kuphela ngesikhathi.
In fact, you do not have to do anything.	Empeleni, akudingeki wenze noma yini.
It can happen to all of us.	Kungenzeka kithi sonke.
Or your mother or someone else.	Noma umama wakho noma omunye umuntu.
Well, maybe not.	Hhayi, mhlawumbe akunjalo.
But you don't want to be with me enough.	Kodwa awufuni ukuba nami ngokwanele.
I don't know how I did this.	Angazi ukuthi ngikwenze kanjani lokhu.
We want to do more.	Sifuna ukwenza okuningi kakhulu.
Rather, it is a decision made.	Kunalokho, yilokho okwenziwa isinqumo.
He left, but soon he left.	Wahamba, kodwa ngokushesha wahamba.
I think you are doing well.	Ngicabanga ukuthi uhamba kahle.
You should get one right now.	Kufanele uthole eyodwa njengamanje.
In this, he feels he is talking.	Kulokhu, uzizwa ekhuluma.
Also, in my office.	Futhi, ehhovisi lami.
Or if you think about it.	Noma uma ucabanga ngakho.
That's making a picture.	Lokho ukwenza isithombe.
This is my way, yes.	Lena indlela yami, yebo.
Because, well.	Ngoba, kahle.
But he is already in trouble.	Kodwa usevele wangena enkingeni.
And really hard too.	Futhi kanzima ngempela futhi.
That you are here with me.	Ukuthi ulapha nami.
Right now, for us.	Njengamanje, ngathi.
That, yes.	Lowo, yebo.
He saw that it was much better.	Wabona kungcono kakhulu lokho.
She looked at him quickly.	Wabheka ngaye ngokushesha.
I don't like this a bit.	Angikuthandi lokhu kancane.
I want to live in the city.	Ngifuna ukuhlala edolobheni.
But there is no exit to it.	Kodwa akukho ukuphuma kukho.
Not just me but everyone.	Hhayi mina kuphela kodwa wonke umuntu.
But if you have to do it, you can do it.	Kodwa uma kufanele ukwenze, ungakwenza.
Well, just fine, he thought.	Kuhle, kuhle nje, wacabanga.
Even so, owning one is still beyond the reach of the average person.	Noma ngabe kunjalo, akunjalo ngempela.
There will be no noise.	Ngeke kube khona umsindo.
Yes, he probably would.	Yebo, cishe angathanda.
Just once for him.	Kanye nje kuye.
If you want to know what that thing is.	Uma ufuna ukwazi ukuthi yini leyo nto.
He is only talking about you.	Ukhuluma ngawe kuphela.
Someone or.	Umuntu noma .
I think it is a good marriage.	Ngicabanga ukuthi umshado omuhle.
This could be my biggest mistake.	Lokhu kungaba iphutha lami elikhulu.
It would be difficult for him.	Kungaba nzima kuye.
I think it would be good to do.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kungaba kuhle ukwenza.
So there is no answer for me.	Ngakho ayikho impendulo yami.
Not to me, at least.	Hhayi kimi, okungenani.
Or, really.	Noma, ngempela.
Unless you want to, of course.	Ngaphandle uma ufuna, kunjalo.
You did the right thing.	Wenze into efanele ngempela.
I found one here.	Ngithole eyodwa lapha.
And he did well with it.	Futhi wenza kahle ngakho.
It must be an error.	Kumelwe kube iphutha.
It's okay if he does that.	Kulungile uma enza lokho.
Everyone did a great job.	Wonke umuntu wenze umsebenzi omuhle kakhulu.
I do not know exactly how long.	Angazi ukuthi kuze kube nini ngempela.
It's hard you know.	Kunzima uyazi.
I had to find a job.	Kwadingeka ngithole umsebenzi.
He was everywhere.	Wayebonakala yonke indawo.
I can't do that.	Angeke ngikwazi ukwenza lokho.
And it's not your fault.	Futhi akulona icala lakho.
But there are already three.	Kodwa kakade kukhona ezintathu.
But he knew how.	Kodwa wayazi ukuthi kanjani.
He heard us arrive.	Wezwa sifika.
He certainly felt that way.	Impela wazizwa kanjalo.
Or, almost, a cat.	Noma, cishe, ikati.
He could do nothing for me.	Akakwazanga ukwenza lutho kimi.
He will do that sometimes.	Uzokwenza lokho ngezinye izikhathi.
Anyone, that's all.	Noma ubani, yilokho kuphela.
But you will get better.	Kodwa uzoba ngcono.
At my age, you can wait.	Eminyakeni yami, uyakwazi ukulinda.
Not always in the same place again.	Hhayi njalo endaweni efanayo futhi.
There is no reason to do so.	Asikho isizathu sokwenza kanjalo.
You should not be with me.	Akufanele ube nami.
Well the big problem.	Kulungile inkinga enkulu.
It may be.	Kungase kube nakho.
I thought so too.	Nami bengicabanga lokho.
But there is no improvement anyway.	Kodwa akukho ngcono noma kanjani.
I hope to see you up close.	Ngethemba ukukubona eduze.
And finally, but at least, my family.	Futhi ekugcineni, kodwa okungenani, umndeni wami.
You may have found out about it later.	Kungenzeka ukuthi wathola ngakho kamuva.
I don't even know about it.	Angazi nokuthi ngiyazi ngakho.
Or not, because there is none.	Noma ngeke, ngoba akukho.
That's right.	Yilokho yebo.
I want to end this.	Ngifuna ukuqeda lokhu.
And not much else.	Futhi hhayi okuningi okunye.
You do what you have to do.	Wenza lokho okufanele ukwenze.
He wanted friends.	Wayefuna abangane.
He also never talked about it.	Naye akakaze akhulume ngakho.
It would be easy to do.	Kungaba lula ukukwenza.
Tell everyone about it.	Tshela wonke umuntu ngakho.
I will not come to the office.	Ngeke ngize ehhovisi.
He wanted her to stop.	Wayefuna ukuthi ayeke.
Today with me.	Namuhla nami.
That is why we must do this.	Yingakho kufanele sikwenze lokhu.
Unbeknownst to them, of course.	Bengazi, kunjalo.
Very good there.	Kuhle kakhulu lapho.
It could happen right now.	Kungenzeka okwamanje.
But he had to be there.	Kodwa bekufanele abe khona.
I now regret this.	Ngiyasola manje ngalokhu.
Because he thought it was right.	Ngoba wayecabanga ukuthi kufanele.
You do not have to know the name beforehand.	Akudingekile ukwazi igama ngaphambili.
Staying in my place.	Ukuhlala endaweni yami.
We cannot go without him.	Ngeke sihambe ngaphandle kwakhe.
No meat, nothing.	Ayikho inyama, akukho lutho.
You should not be sitting here with him.	Akumele ngabe uhlezi naye lapha.
He wants to know what you look like.	Ufuna ukwazi ukuthi ubukeka kanjani.
Today or tomorrow.	Namuhla noma kusasa.
That would be a terrible thing to do.	Lokho kungaba yinto embi kakhulu ukuyenza.
I do.	Ngenza.
But that later.	Kodwa lokho kamuva.
Do not do that to him.	Ungakwenzi lokho kuye.
At that moment, she should know how you really feel.	Ngaleso sikhathi, kufanele azi ukuthi uzizwa kanjani ngempela.
But there's just me here now.	Kodwa kukhona mina nje lapha manje.
I have always been here because of you.	Bengilokhu ngilapha ngenxa yakho.
Still, he knew that he would not stay.	Noma kunjalo, wayazi ukuthi wayengeke ahlale.
Maybe he couldn't do it.	Mhlawumbe akakwazanga ukukwenza.
Probably because it should.	Mhlawumbe ngoba kufanele.
Well, it would be a lie.	Kulungile, kungaba amanga.
Definitely.	Nakanjani .
I'm a little unsure.	Angiqiniseki kancane mina.
There will be your room.	Kuzoba khona igumbi lakho.
That's really hard to do.	Lokho kunzima ngempela ukukwenza.
Afternoon home.	Ntambama ekhaya.
We found a place.	Sithole indawo.
And your hope.	Futhi ithemba lakho.
You need to make a decision.	Udinga ukwenza isinqumo.
But you should know something.	Kodwa kufanele wazi okuthile.
You do not have to wait for another one.	Akumele ulindele enye.
He settled down immediately.	Wahlala ngokushesha.
He is a man better than I am.	Uyindoda kunami.
But the question is who.	Kodwa umbuzo uthi ubani.
One should be able to spend time with him.	Umuntu kufanele akwazi ukuchitha isikhathi naye.
So he has to come.	Ngakho kufanele afike.
And he said it was all true.	Futhi wathi konke kuyiqiniso.
He will be coming home soon.	Uzofika ekhaya maduze nje.
There is space on the table.	Kukhona indawo etafuleni.
Not for all the money in the world.	Hhayi ngayo yonke imali emhlabeni.
He wanted to hear more too.	Wayefuna ukuzwa okwengeziwe futhi.
So now you probably already know.	Ngakho manje cishe uzokwazi kakade.
And it is not necessary to do so.	Futhi akudingekile ukwenza kanjalo.
Too many questions, perhaps.	Imibuzo eminingi kakhulu, mhlawumbe.
Both of them, too.	Bobabili, naye futhi.
First of all, this is good.	Okokuqala, lokhu kuhle.
Well, this is not going to happen.	Kulungile, ngeke kwenzeke lokhu.
He did not even know what he meant.	Wayengazi nokuthi usho ukuthini.
I think you are worried.	Ngicabanga ukuthi ukhathazekile.
You've got your whole life on that.	Uthole impilo yakho yonke ngalokho.
Or he thought it should be so.	Noma wacabanga ukuthi kufanele kube njalo.
I live for him.	Ngihlala ngenxa yakhe.
I don't know if he really exists, either.	Angazi ukuthi ukhona ngempela, futhi.
He wanted to get his approval.	Wayefuna ukuthola imvume yakhe.
Not really, he said that yesterday.	Cha impela, usho lokho izolo.
At home today.	Ekhaya namuhla.
I really wanted to go.	Ngangifuna kakhulu ukuhamba.
And everyone is so happy.	Futhi wonke umuntu ujabule kakhulu.
You only have the ability.	Unekhono kuphela.
Sounds great, though.	Umsindo omkhulu, kodwa.
Is this okay?	Ngabe lokhu kulungile.
You should stay in the room.	Kufanele uhlale ekamelweni.
For a long time he openly refused to do so.	Isikhathi eside wenqaba ngokusobala ukwenza kanjalo.
Yes, you look like him.	Yebo, ufana naye.
Where you like.	Lapho uthanda khona.
And not at night.	Futhi hhayi ebusuku.
It might be helpful for me to talk to him.	Kungase kube usizo kimi ukukhuluma naye.
You just have to do it.	Kuzomele ukwenze nje.
Needless to say this is okay.	Asikho isidingo sokuthi lokhu kulungile.
I would like to tell you why.	Ngithanda ukukutshela ukuthi kungani.
I need to be with him.	Ngidinga ukuba naye.
I have never been able to buy like this.	Angikaze ngikwazi ukuthenga kanje.
He found one nearby.	Wathola eyodwa eduze.
He is always like that.	Uhlale enjalo.
We want money.	Sifuna imali.
Maybe he can't.	Mhlawumbe akakwazi.
A week, maybe, every year.	Isonto, mhlawumbe, njalo ngonyaka.
You just can't go.	Ngeke nje uhambe.
I don't think it would be helpful.	Angicabangi ukuthi kungaba usizo.
I need the truth.	Ngidinga iqiniso.
He first came.	Waqala weza.
I just wanted a chance.	Bengifuna ithuba nje.
I mean nothing.	Ngisho ukuthi akukho lutho.
He cannot be everywhere at once.	Akakwazi ukuba yonke indawo ngesikhathi esisodwa.
He knows all this.	Uyakwazi konke lokhu.
Sometimes at night.	Ngezinye izikhathi ebusuku.
There is danger and you need help.	Kukhona ingozi futhi udinga usizo.
You need to make mistakes.	Udinga ukwenza amaphutha.
In fact, he is not.	Empeleni, akayena.
And that is exactly the problem.	Futhi yilokho kanye inkinga.
She wanted to get to the hospital.	Wayefuna ukufika esibhedlela.
You will be here anytime.	Uzoba lapha noma nini.
My father was also absent.	Ubaba naye wayengekho.
If only a little.	Ukube nje kancane.
I think it's time for me to go.	Ngicabanga ukuthi sekuyisikhathi sokuthi ngihambe.
And on earth.	Futhi emhlabeni.
I think that's okay with me.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kulungile kimi.
They say, we can't talk.	Bathi, asikwazi ukukhuluma.
He's a great guy now.	Ungumfana omkhulu manje.
Not bad though.	Hhayi kabi kodwa.
Just food.	Ukudla nje.
Or at least it should be so.	Noma okungenani kufanele kube njalo.
Now the question.	Manje umbuzo.
I knew you could do it.	Ngangazi ukuthi ungakwenza.
My mother is so beautiful.	Umama wami muhle kakhulu.
He opened a case.	Wavula icala.
Not just one.	Hhayi eyodwa kuphela.
I would love to learn how.	Ngingathanda ukufunda ukuthi kanjani.
I couldn’t do it now, though.	Angikwazanga ukukwenza manje, noma kunjalo.
A good marriage of all together.	Umshado omuhle wakho konke ndawonye.
I think you have slowed down a bit.	Ngicabanga ukuthi uke uhambe kancane.
But you need to get more out of it.	Kodwa udinga ukuphuma okwengeziwe.
I just want to go.	Ngifuna ukuhamba kuphela.
We made a mistake and not a crime.	Senze iphutha hhayi icala.
Whether he wants to see you or not.	Ukuthi uyafuna ukukubona noma cha.
He refused to go back to school.	Wenqaba ukubuyela esikoleni.
All right, all right for me.	Kulungile, kulungile kimi.
It's not me in this.	Akumina kulokhu.
Soon you know.	Ngokushesha uyazi.
I can't really get to that problem.	Angikwazi ngempela ukufika lapho inkinga.
He said he couldn't do it.	Wathi akakwazi ukukwenza.
How it has been.	Kube kanjani.
I never knew what it was.	Angikaze ngazi ukuthi iyiphi.
The doctor will do this and that.	Udokotela uzokwenza lokhu nalokhu.
I'm glad you did that.	Ngiyajabula ukuthi ukwenzile lokho.

I'm not sure, now.	Angiqiniseki, manje.
You know the best way for you.	Uyazi indlela engcono kakhulu kuwe.
Death is not real.	Ukufa akulona iqiniso.

He wanted to drink from her.	Wayefuna ukuphuza kuye.

Now this just happened.	Manje kwenzeka lokhu nje.
My job is good.	Muhle umsebenzi wami.
It is not a new way of doing things.	Akuyona indlela entsha yokwenza izinto.
I need to drink water first.	Ngidinga ukuphuza amanzi kuqala.
It can be something, it can be anything.	Kungaba yinto, kungaba lutho.
He felt that he was not there.	Wezwa ukuthi akekho.
That is very appropriate.	Lokho kufanele kakhulu.
No permission, no speech.	Ayikho imvume, akukho ukukhuluma.
I said that would be great.	Ngathi kuzoba kuhle lokho.
Dad is happy.	Ubaba ujabule.
But that is life sometimes.	Kodwa yilokho ukuphila ngezinye izikhathi.

That's the only thing anybody ever did.	Yilokho kuphela noma ubani ake akwenza.
We didn’t, really.	Asizange senze, ngempela.
Not all police officers can do that.	Akuwona wonke amaphoyisa angakwenza lokho.
Actually, living here does not mean death.	Empeleni, ukuphila lapha akusho ukufa.
But he would not tell me when.	Kodwa ubengeke angitshele ukuthi nini.

Now this is happening.	Manje lokhu kwenzeka.

Stay here.	Uhlale lapha.
But it looks bad.	Kodwa kubukeka kabi.
He did not make a decision on his behalf.	Akazange enze isinqumo endaweni yakhe.
But you can do that.	Kodwa ungakwenza lokho.
He arrived last night.	Ufike izolo ebusuku.
It's really hard to do well.	Kunzima ngempela ukwenza kahle.
I wanted to keep going.	Bengifuna ukuqhubeka nakho.
I really like spending time with you.	Ngithanda kakhulu ukuchitha isikhathi nawe.
He has nothing to do with her.	Akanayo kuye.

They appear to be trying to fall asleep.	Abonakale ezama ukulala.
This is by no means a problem there.	Lokhu akuyona neze inkinga lapho.
He didn't want to get in there.	Wayengafuni ukungena lapho.
There is much more to be done.	Kuningi okunye okumele kwenziwe.
I actually could not see anything.	Empeleni angikwazanga ukubona lutho.
Don't be overly optimistic or overly critical.	Ungabi muhle noma ucabange ngokweqile ngakho.
In fact, it has been good.	Empeleni, kube kuhle.
But this is not his opinion.	Kodwa lokhu akuwona umbono wakhe.
That's not it, really.	Akukhona lokho, empeleni.
I want to say something to you.	Ngifuna ukusho okuthile kuwe.
Sleeping with you.	Ukulala nawe.
Whenever you want to talk.	Noma nini lapho ufuna ukukhuluma.
I did not want to take that approach.	Ngangingafuni ukuthatha leyo ndlela.
At first he did not know what to do.	Ekuqaleni wayengazi ukuthi enzeni.
No, not too long.	Hhayi, hhayi isikhathi eside kakhulu.
But he did not have that time.	Kodwa wayengenaso leso sikhathi.
Sorry we did.	Ngiyaxolisa senze.
This is a new approach.	Lena indlela entsha.
So it is.	Ngakho kunjalo.

But my party totally.	Kodwa iphathi yami ngokuphelele.
And he took.	Futhi wathatha .

I want to go with you and be with you.	Ngifuna ukuhamba nawe ngibe nawe.
We must do the same together.	Kumelwe senze kanjalo ndawonye.
Not him.	Hhayi yena .
We shouldn’t have done anything about it.	Bekungafanele senze lutho ngakho.
He just wanted to go faster.	Wayefuna nje ukuhamba ngokushesha.
He is just willing to learn.	Uzimisele nje ukufunda.
There is no word on how long this will take.	Akukho okushiwo ukuthi lokhu kuzothatha isikhathi esingakanani.
With that outside.	Ngalokho ngaphandle.
I probably went too far with you.	Cishe ngihambe kakhulu nawe.
Wherever he goes, do it.	Lapho eya khona, wenzeni.
But people.	Kodwa abantu.
And now you, too.	Futhi manje nawe, nawe.

That is simply not true.	Akulona neze iqiniso lokho.
Speaking of which, that would be great right now.	Ukukhuluma ngakho, lokho kungaba kuhle okwamanje.
Either way, you can do something.	Noma iyiphi indlela, uyakwazi ukwenza okuthile.

You want to be a good teacher.	Ufuna ukuba uthisha omuhle.
He can stay as long as he wants.	Angakwazi ukuhlala isikhathi eside njengoba efuna.
Her mother opened the door.	Umama wakhe wavula umnyango.
So you say yes.	Ngakho uthi yebo.

You need a lot of help.	Udinga usizo kakhulu.
But not as it is now.	Kodwa hhayi njengoba manje.
And you shouldn’t have gone.	Futhi bekungafanele uhambe.
It does not mean that it has never happened before.	Akusho ukuthi akuzange kwenzeke ngaphambili.
He refused his job.	Wenqaba umsebenzi wakhe.
This sounds great.	Lokhu kuzwakala .
Certainly if you do that often.	Impela uma wenza lokho kaningi.

Someone knows.	Kukhona owaziyo.
Thanks for making it happen.	Ngiyabonga ukuthi kwenzeke.
It is always difficult.	Kunzima ngaso sonke isikhathi.
You should stay for a while.	Kufanele uhlale isikhashana.
It has to be.	Kudingeka kube.
I better do it alone.	Kungcono ngikwenze ngedwa.
Not really a question.	Akuwona umbuzo ngempela.
First, all if at all.	Okokuqala, konke uma kungcono.
And again his choice.	Futhi futhi ukukhetha kwakhe.
It was very necessary.	Kwakudingeka kakhulu.
If so, there should be no problem.	Uma kunjalo, akufanele kube khona inkinga.
It was clear he did not want to talk.	Kwacaca ukuthi akafuni ukukhuluma.
I will never talk about your work again.	Angeke ngiphinde ngikhulume ngomsebenzi wakho.
You did really well there.	Wenze kahle impela lapho.
But a great man to know.	Kodwa umuntu omkhulu ukwazi.
Why, you're right.	Ngani, usho kahle.

This had to happen.	Lokhu kwakudingeka kwenzeke.
It’s so much better, it really is.	Kungcono kakhulu, kunjalo ngempela.
Let me say one thing.	Ake ngisho into eyodwa.

Or rather he did.	Noma kunalokho wenza.
I'm going home now.	Ngiya ekhaya manje.
Hopefully tonight or tomorrow.	Ngethemba kusihlwa noma kusasa.
Not here, but close.	Hhayi lapha, kodwa eduze.
Yes, that's right there.	Yebo, lowo khona lapho.
And yes, it will be here.	Futhi yebo, kuzoba lapha.

You did just fine.	Wenze kahle nje.
And she is beautiful, she works all the time.	Futhi muhle, usebenza ngaso sonke isikhathi.
Instead, there is nothing.	Kunalokho, akukho lutho.
Yes, definitely a case.	Yebo, nakanjani icala.
You don’t think too much about it.	Awucabangi kakhulu ngakho.
But that would be a lie.	Kodwa lokho kungaba amanga.
I do not like this at all.	Angikuthandi nakancane lokhu.
That is very true, yes.	Lokho kuyiqiniso kakhulu, yebo.
But he can't do it.	Kodwa akakwazi ukwenza.
Great again, that.	Okukhulu futhi, lokho.

Home at last.	Ekhaya ekugcineni.
One should not do what one should do.	Umuntu akufanele enze lokho okufanele akwenze.
But he has to go.	Kodwa kumele ahambe.
She may be able to get married.	Angase akwazi ukushada.
I wanted him to come to me now.	Bengifuna eze kimi manje.
I thought, well, what it would be.	Ngacabanga, kahle, ukuthi kuzoba yini.
He seemed to live in a big city.	Wayebonakala ehlala edolobheni elikhulu.
You probably did.	Kungenzeka ukuthi ukwenzile.
To be better, by the way.	Ukuze ube ngcono, ngendlela.
He likes to make a lot of money.	Uthanda ukwenza imali kakhulu.
So tell me your story.	Ngakho ngitshele indaba yakho.
But for now it looks like it.	Kodwa okwamanje kubukeka sengathi .
It all happened to you, not to you.	Konke kwenzeka kuwe, hhayi kuwe.
What about you? 	Wena yini?
The only problem is that he never said where.	Inkinga nje ukuthi akakaze asho ukuthi kuphi.
And you need more.	Futhi udinga okuningi.
That person could be me.	Ukuthi umuntu kungaba yimi.
I never thought why.	Angizange ngicabange ukuthi kungani.

Or maybe at the beginning.	Noma mhlawumbe ekuqaleni.
You look like that.	Ubukeka kanjalo.
So he thought.	Ngakho wacabanga.
That happens everywhere.	Lokho kwenzeka yonke indawo.
That doesn't mean it can't happen here.	Lokho akusho ukuthi ngeke kwenzeke lapha.
He spoke just before we left.	Wakhuluma ngaphambi nje kokuba sihambe.
But, yes, there is something.	Kodwa, yebo, kukhona okuthile.
Isn't it?	Angithi yebo.
A story we should all know.	Indaba okufanele siyazi sonke.
It may have been once, but not now.	Ngabe kukhona kanye, kodwa hhayi manje.
But this will be just you and me.	Kodwa lokhu kuzoba mina nawe nje.
Hope to see you up close !.	Ngethemba ukukubona eduze!.

He is not always.	Akekho njalo.
You do not have to go out at all.	Akudingekile ukuphuma nhlobo.
This should not be necessary.	Lokhu akufanele kudingeke.
The music started again.	Umculo waqala futhi.
He talked a lot to me.	Wakhuluma kakhulu nami.
You need one big one.	Udinga eyodwa enkulu.
And you need to work.	Futhi udinga ukusebenza.
You have to go.	Kuzofanele uhambe.
There are times when you speak too fast.	Kukhona izikhathi lapho ukhuluma ngokushesha kakhulu.

How to get this.	Ukuthola kanjani lokhu.
I need someone there.	Ngidinga umuntu lapho.
All of this here is fine.	Konke lokhu lapha kulungile.
Thank you again very much.	Ngiyabonga futhi kakhulu.

We really want kids.	Sifuna izingane ngempela.
We found out how.	Sithole ukuthi kanjani.
We all have to.	Sonke kufanele.
To be honest, it happened a lot of times.	Ukukhuluma iqiniso, kwenzeka izikhathi eziningi.
But the work did not go well.	Kodwa umsebenzi awuzange uhambe kahle.
Well, something happened.	Kuhle ukuthi kukhona okwenzekile.
He does not know this.	Akakwazi lokhu.
But you got it right on top.	Kodwa uthole kahle phezulu.
Doing so would be a mistake.	Ukwenza kanjalo kungaba iphutha.
I'm happy, actually.	Ngiyajabula, empeleni.
But very good, all that is said.	Kodwa kuhle kakhulu, konke okushiwo.

This may be a mistake.	Lokhu kungase kube iphutha.
Yes, he is really scared.	Yebo, uyesaba ngempela.
He saw that it was true.	Wabona ukuthi kuyiqiniso lokho.
I think you read hard all the time.	Ngicabanga ukuthi ufunda kanzima njalo.

There is another better way.	Kukhona enye indlela engcono kakhulu.
But that is not my job.	Kodwa lokho akuwona umsebenzi wami.

He stayed between her for a long time.	Wahlala phakathi kwakhe isikhathi eside.
On the contrary, he spoke the truth.	Kunalokho, wakhuluma iqiniso.
And anyone can spend his money easily.	Futhi noma ubani angakwazi ukuchitha imali yakhe kalula.
I need to find out what happened to him.	Ngidinga ukuthola ukuthi kwenzekani kuye.
Actually death is.	Empeleni ukufa.
But he didn't, and he didn't.	Kodwa akazange, futhi akazange.
Food is not just about anything.	Ukudla akuyona nje noma iyiphi into.
Eyes, maybe.	Amehlo, mhlawumbe.
He can't work.	Akakwazi ukusebenza.
You will do it sooner or later.	Uzokwenza ngokushesha noma kamuva.
It can be anywhere in the world.	Kungaba noma kuphi emhlabeni.
He should not have said it.	Bekungafanele akusho.
I never told anyone.	Angikaze ngitshele omunye umuntu.
But.	Kodwa .
This is sometimes true but not always true.	Lokhu ngezinye izikhathi kodwa akulona iqiniso ngaso sonke isikhathi.
I will make it as easy as possible.	Ngizokwenza kube lula ngangokunokwenzeka.

Every month here.	Njalo ngenyanga lapha .
You will need to read this again.	Uzodinga ukufunda lokhu futhi.
And the problem is not small.	Futhi inkinga akuyona encane.

This is not an idea.	Lokhu akuwona umqondo.
Maybe he told me.	Mhlawumbe wangitshela.
He proposed to her and she agreed.	Wacela ukushada naye wavuma.
He had to do this well.	Kwakufanele akwenze lokhu kahle.
If only, if only.	Uma kuphela, uma kuphela.
I wanted a party.	Bengifuna iphathi.
Being here.	Ukuba lapha.
That really is not the case.	Lokho empeleni akunjalo.
Thinking is good.	Ukucabanga kuhle.
Not for long, anyway.	Hhayi isikhathi eside, noma kanjani.
But, if you read my book you will know that.	Kodwa, uma ufunda incwadi yami uzokwazi lokho.
It may also be helpful.	Kungase futhi kube usizo.
I could not figure out how to do this.	Angikwazanga ukuthola ukuthi ngingakwenza kanjani lokhu.
He is here with us.	Ulapha nathi futhi.
She was afraid to leave her house.	Wayesaba ukuhamba endlini yakhe.
He will never return.	Angeke aphinde abuye.
Not today and probably not.	Hhayi namuhla futhi mhlawumbe akunjalo.
He did not want to come to you.	Wayengafuni ukuza kuwe.
I would like to have sex with you.	Ngingathanda ukulala nawe.
I mean, that's fine.	Ngisho, lokho kuhle.
I need to get to the top of the hospital.	Ngidinga ukufika phezulu esibhedlela.

Don't forget to get help.	Ungakhohlwa ukuthola usizo.
Maybe you should have it.	Mhlawumbe kufanele ube nakho.
I have to think of one.	Kuzofanele ngicabange eyodwa.
Maybe beer.	Mhlawumbe ubhiya.
Says the father.	Uthi ubaba .
How beautiful she is.	Muhle kanjani.
Instead, he saw nothing.	Kunalokho, akazange abone lutho.
No need to wait.	Akudingekile ukulinda.
That will take a lot of energy.	Lokho kuzothatha amandla amaningi kakhulu.
But we made a mistake here.	Kodwa senza iphutha lapha.
But you can't stay here.	Kodwa awukwazi ukuhlala lapha.
It had to be very convincing.	Kwadingeka ukukholisa kakhulu.
It's time for us to go home.	Sekuyisikhathi sokuthi siye ekhaya.
What my father did.	Okwenziwa ubaba.
You better stay here.	Kungcono uhlale lapha.
Only it will not really happen that way.	Kuphela ngeke empeleni kwenzeke kanjalo.
Almost a bad time, too.	Cishe isikhathi esibi, futhi.
Everyone in the world wants to see this.	Wonke umuntu emhlabeni ufuna ukukubona lokhu.
There is actually nothing there.	Empeleni akukho lutho lapho.
We made all my clothes.	Senza zonke izingubo zami.
Maybe our home.	Mhlawumbe umuzi wethu.
I would like to know more now.	Ngifisa ukwazi kakhulu manje.
Not just immediately.	Hhayi nje ngokushesha.
He had to be.	Kwakufanele abe njalo.
Man could not do things again.	Umuntu akakwazanga ukwenza izinto kabusha.
If you are absolutely sure.	Uma uqinisekile ngokuphelele.
For a long time, it all happened.	Isikhathi eside, konke kwenzeka.
Yes you can, but, it's hard.	Yebo ungakwazi, kodwa, kunzima.
Let's go together.	Ake sihambe ndawonye.
Without you, no problem.	Ngaphandle kwakho, ayikho inkinga.
But it has been a while.	Kodwa sekunesikhathi.
Repairs need to be made.	Kudingeka ukulungisa.
It should be easy, and it is.	Kufanele kube lula, futhi kunjalo.
My father did it.	Ubaba wakwenza.
So, to move on.	Ngakho, ukuqhubeka.
Phone, if you like.	Ucingo, uma uthanda.
It's too late, actually.	Sekwephuzile kakhulu, empeleni.
It should be children.	Kufanele kube izingane.
That seems obvious to me.	Lokho kubonakala kimi kusobala.
There is still no improvement.	Namanje akukho ngcono.
I want a family.	Ngifuna umndeni.
I have a lot to do because of him.	Kuningi okumele ngikwenze ngenxa yakhe.
That's it or the bus.	Yilokho noma ibhasi.
Not in this country, it's true.	Hhayi kuleli, kuyiqiniso.
Probably, but not.	Cishe, kodwa cha.
I did not even know where.	Ngangingazi nokuthi kuphi.
The worse the better.	Okubi kakhulu kungcono.
But something terrible happened.	Kodwa kwenzeka into embi kakhulu.
A bad person.	Umuntu omubi .
He is tall too.	Mude futhi.
He felt as if he were not there.	Wezwa sengathi akekho.
She tried to be nice to him.	Wazama ukuba muhle kuye.
Doing what he did.	Ukwenza akwenzile.
Just because he can.	Ngoba nje angakwazi.
Just him and her.	Yena kanye naye nje.
Times there.	Izikhathi lapho.
He eats meat.	Udla inyama.
But yes, you can.	Kodwa yebo, ungakwazi.
You would not go alone.	Ubungeke uhambe wedwa.
Sometimes you just want to be a bad person.	Ngezinye izikhathi ufuna nje ukuba umuntu omubi.
I think one of us should have this.	Ngicabanga ukuthi omunye wethu kufanele abe nalokhu.
To think, but not to think.	Ukucabanga, kodwa hhayi ukucabanga.
He will be talking to you.	Uzobe ekhuluma nawe.
He can't be that good, though.	Angeke abe muhle kangako, noma kunjalo.
Work is much better.	Umsebenzi ungcono kakhulu.
We can't stay here too long.	Asikwazi ukuhlala lapha isikhathi eside kakhulu.
We know it's hard to do.	Siyazi ukuthi kunzima ukukwenza.
The way it should be.	Indlela okufanele kube ngayo.
Dinner at the venue.	Isidlo sakusihlwa endaweni.
And so that's what happened.	Futhi ngakho yilokho okwenzekile.
I have to talk to her before she goes home.	Kumele ngikhulume naye ngaphambi kokuthi aye ekhaya.
To say the least.	Ukusho ngokuphelele.
Please do it, just you.	Ngicela ukwenze, wena nje.
I don't know anything.	Angazi noma yini.
I want to play something else now.	Ngifuna ukudlala enye into manje.
He was not in school.	Wayengekho esikoleni.
So yes, no waste of time.	Ngakho yebo, akukho ukuchitha isikhathi.
How does one do this.	Umuntu ukwenza kanjani lokhu.
We should never be here.	Akufanele nhlobo sibe lapha.
Not a single house or car.	Akuyona indlu eyodwa noma imoto.
And she is very beautiful too.	Futhi muhle kakhulu futhi.
Finally he looked up.	Ekugcineni wabheka.
The question is how much.	Umbuzo uthi malini.
Bad message.	Umlayezo omubi.
He walked over to her.	Ahambe aye kuye.
And it will not be good.	Futhi ngeke kube kuhle.
We do this about once a week.	Senza lokho cishe kanye ngesonto.
Unless he went nowhere, that's right.	Ngaphandle kokuthi akazange aye ndawo, kunjalo.
And you want to sing.	Futhi ufuna ukucula.
I thought too much.	Ngangicabanga ngokweqile.
He began to sleep better at night.	Waqala ukulala kangcono ebusuku.
This should be the way it is.	Lokhu kufanele kube ngale ndlela.
He started reading.	Waqala ukufunda.
Many years to you.	Iminyaka eminingi kuwe.
It's not just there.	Akukhona nje lapho.
He still does not want to talk to her.	Namanje akafuni ukukhuluma naye.
You never knew.	Awukaze ukwazi.
No, there is no time.	Cha, asikho isikhathi.
He is right there.	Nguye khona lapho.
He did or said nothing.	Wenza noma akazange asho okuthile.
Not that you won't be.	Hhayi ukuthi ngeke ube.
You can never be wrong.	Awukwazi nakancane iphutha.
He first found his way home.	Waqala wathola indlela eya ekhaya.
And that can be.	Futhi lokho kungaba .
But not everywhere.	Kodwa hhayi yonke indawo.
He did this as often as possible.	Lokhu wakwenza kaningi ngangokunokwenzeka.
Or at least, that should not be the case.	Noma okungenani, akufanele kube njalo.
Now he did not know.	Manje wayengazi.
I thought that was probably the case.	Ngangicabanga ukuthi mhlawumbe kunjalo.
So the story.	Ngakho indaba.
I even think.	Ngisho ngicabanga.
How it happened in the world.	Kwenzeke kanjani emhlabeni.
Let's get another idea.	Ake sithole omunye umbono.
I wanted to come here.	Bengifuna ukuza lapha.
Or at least say something.	Noma okungenani ngisho okuthile.
Maybe there is a better way.	Mhlawumbe kukhona indlela engcono.
At least you think he is.	Okungenani ucabanga ukuthi nguye.
He must know this.	Kumele akwazi lokhu.
She would like to know more about him.	Kuningi angathanda ukwazi ngaye.
Of course it is so often.	Impela kunjalo kaningi kakhulu.
How did that happen ?.	Kwenzeka kanjani lokho?.
So that he can help.	Ukuze akwazi ukusiza.
I got a good answer.	Ngithole impendulo enhle.
You cannot read anything at once.	Awukwazi ukufunda noma yini ngesikhathi esisodwa nje.
And don't forget.	Futhi ungakhohlwa.
No one really knows what should happen then.	Akekho owaziyo ngempela ukuthi kufanele kwenzekeni ngaleso sikhathi.
Certainly not in this country ?.	Impela akukho kuleli?.
He did not think it would be so here.	Wayengacabangi ukuthi kuzoba njalo lapha.
Is there anything else you need to know about that?	Ngabe kukhona okunye okumele ukwazi ngalokho?
Finally the universe.	Ekugcineni indawo yonke.
I don’t want to take anything from him.	Angifuni ukuthatha lutho kuye.
That you did very well.	Ukuthi wenze kahle kakhulu.
He never talked to me about it.	Akakaze akhulume ngayo nami.
What a wonderful job.	Yeka umsebenzi omuhle.
I don't really know anything.	Angazi lutho ngempela.
But it will be very difficult.	Kodwa kuzoba nzima kakhulu.
I want to be very selective.	Ngifuna ukukhetha kakhulu.
Beer.	Ubhiya.
I must have thought a lot though.	Kumelwe ukuba ngicabange kakhulu kodwa.
He said this would happen soon.	Uthe lokhu kuzokwenzeka ngokushesha.
And how do you talk about it.	Futhi ukhuluma kanjani ngakho.
When did this happen?	Kwenzeka nini lokhu.
Back to school and everything.	Ukubuyela esikoleni nakho konke.
We know the whole story.	Siyazi yonke indaba.
You should get a new job.	Kufanele uthole umsebenzi omusha.
You think too much of this.	Ucabanga ngokweqile ngalokhu.
Long time, actually.	Isikhathi eside, empeleni.
At home, he thought.	Ekhaya, wacabanga.
In the end, it's best to be honest.	Ekugcineni, kungcono kakhulu ukukhuluma iqiniso.
Sounds like that would be a lot easier.	Kuzwakala sengathi lokho kungaba lula kakhulu.
At the moment nothing is happening.	Okwamanje akukho okwenzekayo.
You learn to buy better.	Ufunda ukuthenga kangcono.
So maybe yes.	Ngakho kungenzeka yebo.
But you know that it will not happen.	Kodwa uyazi ukuthi ngeke kwenzeke lokho.
She thought of her father.	Wacabanga ubaba wakhe.
I like going to the park.	Ngithanda ukuya epaki.
He did very well with her.	Wenza kahle kakhulu naye.
It will probably be for a while.	Cishe kuzoba isikhashana.
I had to do a lot.	Kwadingeka ngenze okuningi.
That is a very serious matter.	Leyo yinto embi kakhulu.
I don't want either.	Nami angifuni.
I don’t know why he did this or how.	Angazi ukuthi kungani enze lokhu noma kanjani.
Of course this is not entirely true.	Yebo lokhu akulona iqiniso ngokuphelele.
He knew nothing about her.	Wayengazi lutho ngaye.
Is that difficult.	Ingabe lokho kunzima.
To do that, we need your help.	Ukuze senze lokho, sidinga usizo lwakho.
She likes dinner.	Uthanda isidlo sakusihlwa.
Next year maybe.	Ngonyaka ozayo mhlawumbe.
That's always good.	Kuhle njalo lokho.
And he didn't really want to go.	Futhi wayengafuni ngempela ukuhamba.
I hope he stays.	Ngethemba ukuthi uzobe ehlala.
I really want to stop drinking.	Ngifuna ngempela ukuyeka ukuphuza.
But she is always happy.	Kodwa uhlala ejabule.
I'm sorry to hear about this.	Ngiyaxolisa ukuzwa ngalokhu.
But in the car, it means nothing.	Kodwa emotweni, akusho lutho.
And that is probably okay, but only good.	Futhi lokho mhlawumbe kulungile, kodwa kuhle kuphela.
Still, it's probably okay.	Noma kunjalo, cishe kulungile.
You do not know how difficult this is for me.	Awazi ukuthi kunzima kangakanani kimi lokhu.
I doubt it will happen.	Ngiyangabaza ukuthi kuzokwenzeka.
It may be something, it may be something.	Kungase kube lutho, kungase kube okuthile.
You, something.	Wena, into.
He did not know how long he had been there.	Wayengazi ukuthi wahlala isikhathi esingakanani lapho.
in the morning.	ekuseni.
He says he took a lot of things.	Uthi wathatha izinto eziningi.
I thought he might be able to help.	Ngacabanga ukuthi angase akwazi ukusiza.
Definitely worth it.	Impela kufanele.
No, something else is happening here.	Cha, kukhona okunye okwenzekayo lapha.
Too many hours.	Amahora amaningi kakhulu.
Anything else sounds.	Noma yini enye umsindo.
Or even just food.	Noma ngisho ukudla nje.
It may be, but it may also be very helpful.	Kungaba njalo, kodwa futhi kungase kube usizo kakhulu.
But there is still anyway.	Kodwa kukhona noma kunjalo.
She looked like she too wanted to cry.	Wayebukeka sengathi naye ufuna ukukhala.
I think he didn't want to go.	Ngicabanga ukuthi wayengafuni ukuhamba.
Just a few hours, that's all.	Amahora ambalwa nje, yilokho kuphela.
I should have done something.	Bekufanele ngabe ngenze okuthile.
But, it has to be.	Kodwa, kufanele kube.
I want to ride.	Ngifuna ukugibela.
He did not try to help.	Akazange azame ukusiza.
All afternoon in the office.	Ntambama yonke ehhovisi.
And this really is.	Futhi lokhu ngempela.
And a new story.	Futhi indaba entsha.
And there is nothing behind it.	Futhi akukho lutho ngemva.
Not that good.	Hhayi lokho kuhle.
Where do you like to sleep ?.	Uthanda ukulala kuphi?.
He wasn't really, either.	Wayengeyena ngempela, futhi.
You must not stay and you must not be here.	Akumele uhlale futhi akufanele ube lapha.
I need sleep, that's all.	Ngidinga ukulala, yilokho kuphela.
I like only one.	Ngithanda eyodwa kuphela.
That is the plan.	Yilokho icebo.
She wanted to go to him.	Wayefuna ukuya kuye.
But worst of all is death.	Kodwa okubi kakhulu ukufa.
He asked me to wait.	Wangicela ukuba ngilinde.
He found that he could not speak.	Wathola ukuthi akakwazi ukukhuluma.
My father said it was very good.	Ubaba wathi kuhle kakhulu.
It's not family.	Akuwona umndeni.
I told you all about it.	Ngikutshele konke ngakho.
He would really like to see you there.	Angathanda ngempela ukukubona lapho.
I don't think he'll do well there.	Angicabangi ukuthi uzokwenza kahle lapho.
Making it difficult.	Ukwenza kunzima.
And that is what happened to us.	Futhi yilokho okwenzeka kithi.
Why is this happening ?.	Kungani lokhu kwenzeka?.
Almost entirely, though.	Cishe ngokuphelele, noma kunjalo.
He knows how we do it.	Uyazi ukuthi senza kanjani.
But my mother just wants to be there.	Kodwa umama ufuna nje ukuba khona.
Just because you can't do it doesn't mean you should.	Ukuthi awukwazi akusho ukuthi kufanele.
She felt like she wanted to cry.	Wezwa sengathi ufuna ukukhala.
But something happens all the time, he says.	Kodwa kukhona okwenzeka njalo, uthi.

He did this a lot.	Wenza lokhu kakhulu.
I hope not.	Ngethemba ukuthi akukho.
Or even work.	Noma ngisho ukusebenza.
No one is really good.	Akekho umuntu omuhle ngempela.
And this one.	Futhi lena .
You never want this to happen.	Awufuni neze ukuthi kwenzeke lokhu.
And it happens now once a week.	Futhi kwenzeka manje kanye ngesonto.
Instead he is trying to control himself.	Kunalokho uzama ukuzibamba.
Anyway in the afternoon.	Noma kunjalo ntambama.
There is always more.	Kukhona njalo okwengeziwe.
Certainly not.	Impela, hhayi lena.
Today, he is coming to us.	Namuhla, uyeza kithi.
And you do not know.	Futhi awazi.
Very, in this case.	Kakhulu, kulokhu.
So one would not know.	Ngakho umuntu ubengeke azi.
But he did not stay there.	Kodwa akazange ahlale lapho.
I have to say, not at all.	Kufanele ngisho, ngisho nakancane.
Maybe there is something else there.	Mhlawumbe kukhona okunye lapho.

Are you worried about waiting a while.	Ingabe ukhathazekile ukulinda isikhashana.
And if you don't know that's fine.	Futhi uma ungakwazi lokho kulungile.
But that is not the case, it is not.	Kodwa lokho akunjalo, akunjalo.
It should, really.	Bekufanele, ngempela.
It's hard to die.	Kunzima ukufa.
There’s not much here, either.	Akukho okuningi lapha, futhi.
Just air, that's all.	Umoya nje, yilokho kuphela.
Yes, that can be helpful.	Yebo, lokho kungaba usizo.

You have only done one so far.	Wenze eyodwa kuphela kuze kube manje.
You will get better in the end.	Uzoba ngcono ekugcineni.
A team is needed.	Kudingeka iqembu.
Later, he says.	Kamuva, uthi.
Great hope is needed.	Kudingeka ithemba elikhulu.
It's time to dump her and move on.	Sekuyisikhathi sokuthi uzimisele ngakho.
But it happened many times.	Kodwa kwenzeka kaningi.

I want to go to a restaurant.	Ngifuna ukuya endaweni yokudlela.
Sounds like it should be easy.	Kuzwakala sengathi kufanele kube lula.
And he gave one reason.	Futhi wanikeza isizathu esisodwa.
That is not a move.	Lokho akukhona ukuhamba.
Food, place.	Ukudla, indawo.
And maybe it should.	Futhi mhlawumbe kufanele kube njalo.
But he asked me to do it.	Kodwa wangicela ukuba ngikwenze.
I had to talk to him.	Bekumele ngikhulume naye.
I asked anyway.	Ngabuza noma kunjalo.
He can drive.	Angakwazi ukushayela.
He stayed there as long as possible.	Wahlala lapho isikhathi eside ngangokunokwenzeka.
You know that is not the answer.	Uyazi ukuthi akuyona impendulo leyo.
Anything here.	Noma yini lapha.
But this time he was not sure.	Kodwa kulokhu wayengenaso isiqiniseko.
I think this happens all the time.	Ngicabanga ukuthi lokhu kwenzeka ngaso sonke isikhathi.
You will know.	Uzokwazi .
You should be the only one there.	Kufanele kube nguwe kuphela lapho.
And it's really good.	Futhi kuhle ngempela.
You just want to get married.	Ufuna nje ukushada.
There is actually something else.	Empeleni kukhona enye into futhi.
He knows he can't do it.	Uyazi ukuthi angeke akwenze.
The one who did this did it well.	Owenze lokhu ukwenze kahle.
Very completely.	Kakhulu ngokuphelele.
But he always went beyond that.	Kodwa njalo waphuma ngale.
I hope you did well.	Ngethemba ukuthi wenze kahle.
But it may also be unnecessary.	Kodwa futhi kungase kungadingeki.
I really know.	Ngiyazi ngempela.
He knows what happened and he knows why.	Uyazi ukuthi kwenzekeni futhi uyazi ukuthi kungani.
Yes, yes you should.	Yebo, yebo kufanele.
I would like it now.	Ngingathanda manje.
Not with your family here.	Hhayi nomndeni wakho lapha.
All right, name.	Kulungile, igama.
Yes he wanted to go.	Yebo wayefuna ukuhamba.
Anything to buy time.	Noma yini ukuthenga isikhathi.
I am everything.	Yimi konke.
We can't wait to see what happens here !.	Asikwazi ukulinda ukubona ukuthi kwenzekani lapha!.
He didn't know what it was all about.	Wayengazi ukuthi yini yonke.
You do a lot and learn more.	Wenza okuningi ufunda okwengeziwe.
I do the same thing every day.	Ngenza into efanayo nsuku zonke.
This will take a little longer.	Lokhu kuzothatha kancane.
And my mom is so much better.	Futhi umama wami ungcono kakhulu.
And that is all he did.	Futhi yilokho kuphela akwenza.
I was thinking about it today, actually.	Bengicabanga ngakho namuhla, empeleni.
And everything or nothing has to happen.	Futhi kufanele kwenzeke konke noma lutho.
Everything will be one thing, or everything else.	Konke kuzoba yinto eyodwa, noma konke okunye.
This will be his exit.	Lokhu kuzoba ukuphuma kwakhe.
You think you will know better.	Ucabanga ukuthi uzokwazi kangcono.
And yes, that happened.	Futhi yebo, lokho kwenzeka.
I've never been up here.	Angikaze ngize ngize lapha phezulu.
And my best friend.	Futhi umngane wami omkhulu.
She looked happy and very happy.	Wayebukeka ejabule futhi ejabule kakhulu.
He knew it wasn't.	Wayazi ukuthi akunjalo.
I can't help that.	Ngeke ngikwazi ukusiza kulokho.
And he dwelt with him.	Futhi wahlala naye.
Hours sometimes.	Amahora ngezinye izikhathi.
He certainly does not want to see it that way.	Impela akafuni ukukubona kanjalo.
I wonder if he will come back.	Kazi uzobuya yini.
I always go for it, because you can't.	Ngihlala ngiya ngakho, ngoba awukwazi.
Yes, and thank you.	Yebo, futhi ngiyabonga.
You can do it, too.	Ungakwenza, futhi.
You certainly know that right now.	Impela uyakwazi lokho okwamanje.
Not just me.	Hhayi mina ngedwa.
I would love to see how that happens.	Ngingathanda ukubona ukuthi lokho kwenzeka kanjani.
Just taking, taking.	Ukuthatha nje, ukuthatha.
I thought there was more to it, maybe.	Bengicabanga ukuthi kukhona okwengeziwe kukho, mhlawumbe.
So far we are doing very well.	Kuze kube manje senza kahle kakhulu.
Everyone thought so.	Wonke umuntu wayecabanga kanjalo.
And boy was it all worth it.	Futhi umfana kwakufanele konke.
But the boy needs money.	Kodwa umfana udinga imali.
But you can do it, if you really want to.	Kodwa ungakwenza, uma ufuna ngempela.
But that can be difficult to do.	Kodwa lokho kungaba nzima ukukwenza.
And stop driving.	Futhi yeka ukushayela.
He was not one of us.	Wayengeyena omunye wethu.
But no one is around.	Kodwa akekho eduze.
You need to know everything that happened.	Udinga ukwazi konke okwenzekile.
He had high hopes for her.	Wayenethemba elikhulu ngaye.
I'm sorry, but you can't log in there.	Ngiyaxolisa, kodwa awukwazi ukungena lapho.
I want you to tell me some things.	Ngifuna ungitshele ezinye izinto.
He says he can't control himself.	Uthi ngeke akwazi ukuzibamba.
Really, he is my boy.	Ngempela, ungumfana wami.
You stay in one place for a long time.	Uhlale endaweni eyodwa isikhathi eside.
He is also very tall.	Naye mude impela.
However, there is more.	Noma kunjalo, kukhona okunye.
Yes, you know a lot about this.	Yebo, wazi okuningi ngalokhu.
He plans to stay for a few days.	Uhlela ukuhlala izinsuku ezimbalwa.
So, not much or no problem.	Ngakho, hhayi okuningi noma inkinga.
I needed another one, it went very well.	Kwadingeka omunye, uhambe kahle kakhulu.
That sounds like you did the right thing.	Lokho kuzwakala sengathi wenze into efanele.
This is just one way.	Lena indlela eyodwa nje.
But that is not always the case.	Kodwa ngaso sonke isikhathi akulona iqiniso.
You will have to do it.	Kuzofanele wenze njalo.
He just wanted to get out.	Wayefuna ukuphuma nje.
Probably, my father said.	Mhlawumbe, ubaba wathi.
You are very alone.	Uwedwa kakhulu.
He was not her teacher.	Wayengeyena uthisha wakhe.
But something worse happened.	Kodwa okubi kakhulu kwenzeka.
Only, of course.	Kuphela, kunjalo.
I can walk.	Ngingakwazi ukuhamba.
Help someone.	Ngisize umuntu.
He wanted me to be happy.	Wayefuna ngijabule.
That is not a bad thing at all.	Akuyona neze into embi leyo.
He knows he is going to leave soon.	Uyazi ukuthi uzohamba maduze.
But you are really learning, very quickly.	Kodwa ufunda ngempela, ngokushesha okukhulu.
Tell me about it tonight.	Ngitshele ngakho namhlanje ebusuku.
Or he heard other things.	Noma wezwa ezinye izinto.
He would not have thought so.	Wayengeke acabange kanjalo.
He's just a guy !.	Uyinsizwa nje!.
You, baby.	Wena, ingane.
Eventually an accident happened.	Ekugcineni kwenzeka ingozi.
We need one obviously.	Sidinga eyodwa ngokusobala.
What a big mistake.	Iphutha elikhulu yini.
And no one can do it.	Futhi akukho muntu angakwenza.
The way he acts when he is happy.	Indlela enza ngayo uma ejabule.
I don't really think this is true.	Empeleni angicabangi ukuthi lokhu kuyiqiniso.
In the same way he does everyone.	Ngendlela efanayo enza ngayo wonke umuntu.
Good as.	Kuhle njengoba.
He returned to my room.	Wabuyela ekamelweni lami.
I'm sorry about that now.	Ngiyaxolisa ngalokho manje.
But, thank you.	Kodwa, ngiyabonga.
Very good to this day.	Kuhle kakhulu kuze kube namuhla.
I did all that.	Ngenze konke lokho.
Or me, or.	Noma nami, noma.
But we definitely need to talk.	Kodwa nakanjani sidinga ukukhuluma.
Or maybe he.	Noma mhlawumbe yena .
I need to get on with this as soon as possible.	Ngidinga ukuqhubeka nalokhu ngokushesha.
He is present every year.	Ukhona njalo ngonyaka.
It is quite obvious.	Kusobala ngokuphelele.
That should be difficult.	Lokho kumele kube nzima.
I know it's not me.	Ngiyazi akekho mina.
And a bike.	Futhi ibhayisikili.
But that is not the only reason.	Kodwa akusona isizathu kuphela leso.
Or that is my hope.	Noma ithemba lami lelo.
That is hope.	Ithemba lelo.
He loves to read at night and needs one.	Uthanda ukufunda ebusuku futhi udinga eyodwa.
But it is not a new job.	Kodwa akuwona umsebenzi omusha.
I don't like it all.	Angikuthandi konke.
It was not much.	Akuzange kube okuningi.
For both of us.	Ngenxa yethu sobabili.
So, to think about it.	Ngakho, ukucabanga ngakho.
It's hard, it's hard to do.	Kunzima, kunzima ukukwenza.
And we got this up.	Futhi sithole lokhu phezulu.
I just knew everyone knew.	Ngangazi nje ukuthi wonke umuntu uyazi.
But if you can.	Kodwa uma ukwazi .
I need an answer now.	Ngidinga impendulo manje.
He can't make a decision.	Akakwazi ukwenza isinqumo.
Instead, you need to take something.	Kunalokho, udinga ukuthatha okuthile.
But he knew that he would not be able to do it right away.	Kodwa wayazi ukuthi wayengeke akwazi ukukwenza ngokushesha.
It would be nice to see what it really looks like.	Kungaba kuhle ukubona ukuthi kubukeka kanjani ngempela.
But it might be a good idea.	Kodwa kungase kube umqondo omuhle.
I can and will only do that.	Ngingakwazi futhi ngizokwenza lokho kuphela.
But he could not see it.	Kodwa akakwazanga ukukubona.
You know what you have to do.	Uyazi ukuthi kufanele ukwenze.
We know now that this is not really the case.	Siyazi manje ukuthi lokhu akulona iqiniso ngempela.
Her father, too.	Ubaba wakhe, naye.
He wanted to help the team.	Wayefuna ukusiza iqembu.
Not on time to be helpful to you.	Hhayi ngesikhathi ukuze kube usizo kuwe.
It would be just the same thing.	Kungaba yinto efanayo nje.
But this is not a good idea.	Kodwa lokhu akuwona umqondo omuhle.
Everyone is very happy.	Wonke umuntu ujabule kakhulu.
You also cannot get out of the house.	Nawe awukwazi ukuphuma endlini.
He didn't know why, but he knew.	Wayengazi ukuthi kungani, kodwa wayazi.
Yes it is good.	Yebo kuhle.
But he did not go home.	Kodwa akazange aye ekhaya.
I am here to make this better.	Ngilapha ukwenza lokhu kube ngcono.
I think it is good for all of us.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kuhle kithi sonke.
I think yes.	Ngicabanga ukuthi yebo.
Water or food.	Amanzi noma ukudla.
He can do it easily.	Angakwenza kalula.
Try again.	Aphinde azame.
To do the right thing for him.	Ukwenza into efanele ngaye.
She is really beautiful.	Impela muhle.
You learn very quickly.	Ufunda ngokushesha okukhulu.
And you can or can do it.	Futhi ungakwazi noma ungakwenza.
So, what?!.	Ngakho, yini?!.
This is a very serious problem.	Lena inkinga embi kakhulu.
He was not my father.	Wayengeyena ubaba wami.
I wouldn't talk about it.	Bengingeke ngikhulume ngakho.
People at the restaurant too late at night.	Abantu endaweni yokudlela ebusuku kakhulu.
There should be no question.	Akufanele kube khona umbuzo.
Why do you want to do that ?.	Kungani ufuna ukwenza lokho?.
And he did not come alone.	Futhi akazange eze yedwa.
And so on and so forth.	Futhi kanjalo futhi.
I will do more.	Ngizokwenza okwengeziwe.
It is also possible to do too much.	Kungenzeka futhi ukwenza okuningi kakhulu.
The problem is, you think he is.	Inkinga, ucabanga ukuthi nguye.
It will happen very soon.	Kuzokwenzeka ngokushesha okukhulu.
He should stay.	Kufanele ahlale.
But that should be done only once.	Kodwa lokho kufanele kwenziwe kanye nje.
But this is not a very good thing.	Kodwa lokhu akuyona into enhle kakhulu.
So we did.	Ngakho senza njalo.
We need to find out who this person is.	Kumele sithole ukuthi ubani lo muntu.
There is a boy here.	Kukhona umfana lapha.
A bad boy like you.	Umfana omubi njengawe.
There is work in the world, too.	Kukhona umsebenzi emhlabeni, futhi.
I wanted to know about him.	Ngangifuna ukwazi ngaye.
He was not at home in bed.	Wayengekho ekhaya embhedeni.
My father is always there.	Ubaba uhlala njalo.
That should be enough time.	Leso kufanele kube isikhathi esanele.
Three weeks.	Amasonto amathathu.
He thought he had a lot of time.	Wayecabanga ukuthi unesikhathi esiningi.
Someone after all took a chance on you before.	Omunye ngemva kwakho konke wathatha ithuba kuwe ngaphambilini.
And sometimes that sounds like it.	Futhi ngezinye izikhathi kuzwakala kanjalo.
I never thought about it until recently.	Angikaze ngicabange ngakho kuze kube muva nje.
So good hope.	Ngakho ithemba elihle.
I need to do that first.	Ngidinga ukwenza lokho kuqala.
No food.	Akukho ukudla.
Something has to be done about it.	Kufanele kwenziwe okuthile ngakho.
There was nothing else.	Akuzange kube khona okunye.
That's not a good thing, that's it.	Akuyona into enhle, leyo.
It certainly seems to be true.	Impela kubonakala sengathi kuyiqiniso.
Someone other than me.	Omunye ngaphandle kwami.
He should not say that.	Kufanele akusho lokho.
She did her homework as soon as she got home.	Wenza umsebenzi wakhe wesikole ngokushesha nje lapho efika ekhaya.
He wanted to do something big.	Wayefuna ukwenza into enkulu.
He returned to the car.	Wabuyela emotweni.
That happened.	Kwenzeka lokho.
Of course he wasn't sure about it.	Yebo wayengenaso isiqiniseko ngakho.
That would be much better.	Lokho kuzoba ngcono kakhulu.
Yes, he should have known.	Yebo, bekufanele azi.
Not here, not there.	Hhayi lapha, hhayi lapho.
You have to buy one.	Kufanele uthenge eyodwa.
Today, one.	Namuhla, enye.
He wanted just a few months with her.	Wayefuna izinyanga ezimbalwa nje naye.
He knew she was worried.	Wayazi ukuthi ukhathazekile.
I have had to do that before.	Kuye kwadingeka ngikwenze lokho ngaphambili.
As is the case with football.	Njengoba kunjalo ibhola.
So we need more.	Ngakho sidinga okunye.
I could not stop eating.	Angikwazanga ukuyeka ukudla.
Also, do not be silly.	Futhi, ungabi isilima.
Yes this is a good sight.	Yebo lokhu ukubona kahle.
He did it.	Ukwenze wakwenza.
I think everyone is happy.	Ngicabanga ukuthi wonke umuntu ujabule.
think.	ucabange.
We all want you to go with us.	Sonke sifuna ukuthi uhambe nathi.
He spoke reluctantly.	Wakhuluma engafuni.
Talking to him about it.	Ekhuluma naye ngakho.
No, it should not happen.	Cha, akumele kwenzeke.
You look the same way, you know.	Ubukeka ngendlela efanayo, uyazi.
At least another week.	Okungenani elinye isonto.
And sooner or later.	Futhi ngokushesha noma kamuva.
It will happen if it happens.	Kuzokwenzeka uma kwenzeka.
He says it's my fault.	Uthi iphutha lami.
There is no one right way.	Ayikho indlela eyodwa efanele.
He soon became a friend.	Ngokushesha waba umngane.
He talked to me about it.	Wakhuluma nami ngakho.
He wasn't too much about me.	Wayengekho kakhulu ngami.
This will not happen, of course.	Lokhu ngeke kwenzeke, yebo.
He refused many times.	Wenqaba kaningi.
But he wanted to go.	Kodwa wayefuna ukuhamba.
We can't have it all right now.	Asikwazi ukuba nakho konke njengamanje.
One might think so.	Omunye angase acabange ukuthi kunjalo.
Very much the same thing.	Kakhulu into efanayo.
There is something else he can do.	Okunye angakwenza.
It's the same thing with you now.	Yinto efanayo nawe manje.
We need to fix this right now.	Sidinga ukulungisa lokhu njengamanje.
You do not want to cook.	Awufuni ukupheka.
It was not necessary to talk too much.	Kwakungadingeki ukukhuluma kakhulu.
He says he has been there, for almost a week now.	Uthi ukhona, cishe isonto lonke manje.
Still, it is not a problem.	Noma kunjalo, akuyona inkinga.
Yes that is good.	Yebo kuhle lokho.
He knew he shouldn't do that.	Wayazi ukuthi kwakungafanele akwenze lokho.
You will definitely do this again !.	Nakanjani uzokwenza lokhu futhi!.
He tried to help.	Wazama ukusiza.
He sat in front.	Wahlala ngaphambili.
Making it a bad place.	Ukwenza kube indawo embi.
Does anyone know why this might be ?.	Ingabe ukhona owaziyo ukuthi kungani lokhu kungase kube?.
Or at least, at first, it seems.	Noma okungenani, ekuqaleni, kubonakala sengathi.
Obviously not just anyone else can do it.	Ngokusobala akukhona nje omunye umuntu angakwenza ngakho.
Three months is not enough time.	Izinyanga ezintathu akusona isikhathi esanele.
You want a party behind you.	Ufuna iqembu ngemuva kwakho.
People say you are talented.	Abantu bathi unekhono.
He made his day.	Wenze usuku lwakhe.
The doctor stayed with me.	Udokotela wahlala nami.
Why should it? 	Kungani kufanele?
He wanted to help, but he did not know how.	Wayefuna ukusiza, kodwa wayengazi ukuthi kanjani.
I've had this all my life.	Ngibe nalokhu impilo yami yonke.
But you can't do this to me.	Kodwa awukwazi ukwenza lokhu kimi.
Apparently he did well too.	Ngokusobala wenza kahle futhi.
It's hard to find.	Kunzima ukuthola.
At least he thought it was him.	Okungenani wayecabanga ukuthi nguye.
Yes, it seems.	Yebo kubonakala kunjalo.
Three years, too.	Iminyaka emithathu, futhi.
What a horrible picture.	Yeka isithombe esibi.
He got this look.	Wathola lokhu kubukeka.
And, that's true.	Futhi, lokho kuyiqiniso.
The boy looked up.	Umfana wabuka.
He did it alone.	Wenze yedwa.
So, it could be.	Ngakho, kungenzeka ukuthi.
I want to end that.	Ngifuna ukuqeda ngalokho.
I love anything and everything is beautiful.	Ngithanda noma yini futhi yonke into enhle.
There is no danger for us.	Ayikho ingozi kithi.
But that's fine too.	Kodwa lokho kuhle futhi.
And the more, the better.	Futhi okuningi, kungcono.
It has not been easy.	Akazange abe lula.
I did my thing.	Ngenze into yami.
No one thinks it is possible.	Akekho ocabanga ukuthi kungenzeka.
I will not do that with him.	Ngeke ngikwenze lokho naye.
This is by no means a new or innovative idea.	Lokhu akuwona neze umbono omusha noma omusha.
But you are alone.	Kodwa uwedwa.
He will not say anything.	Angeke asho lutho.
I need to drive the kids to school.	Ngidinga ukushayela izingane esikoleni.
Also, his opinion.	Futhi, umbono wakhe.
That doesn't really mean that.	Akusho lokho ngempela.
You just want to be here.	Ufuna nje ukuba lapha.
I had to go there to hear.	Bekufanele ngiye lapho ukuze ngizwe.
Not if but when.	Hhayi uma kodwa nini.
This place here.	Le ndawo lapha.
Tell your family.	Tshela umndeni wakho.
He is busy in the morning at the office.	Umatasa ekuseni ehhovisi.
It's a bad idea every time that happens.	Umbono omubi njalo uma lokho kwenzeka.
So he came and talked to us about it.	Ngakho weza wakhuluma nathi ngakho.
For now, it's you.	Okwamanje, nguwe.
Why not do it.	Kungani ungakwenzi .
There is everything great.	Kukhona yonke into enkulu.
And what a vision.	Futhi yeka umbono.
I will not do well there in the beginning.	Ngeke ngenze kahle lapho ekuqaleni.
So he must not have been able to do that.	Ngakho kumelwe ukuba akakwazanga ukwenza kanjalo.
But maybe not, either.	Kodwa mhlawumbe akunjalo, futhi.
I did all this on my own.	Konke lokhu ngikwenze ngedwa.
This is often seen.	Lokhu kubonakala kaningi.
This will take time, a lot of you.	Lokhu kuzothatha isikhathi, okuningi kwakho.
This can be quite an idea.	Lokhu kungaba umbono impela.
I mean, really a little bit.	Ngisho, kancane ngempela.
Maybe something for you.	Mhlawumbe okuthile kuwe.
I would love to see you up close.	Ngingathanda ukukubona eduze.
Good until it is not.	Kuhle kuze kube akunjalo.
I think that's the thing.	Ngicabanga ukuthi leyo yinto.
And yet, however, he did.	Futhi okwamanje, noma kunjalo, wenza.
He thought he knew everyone.	Wayecabanga ukuthi wazi wonke umuntu.
So yes, there is that.	Ngakho yebo, kukhona lokho.
It could just be my dad.	Kungase kube ubaba wami nje.
But again, isn't it ?.	Kodwa futhi, angithi njalo?.
I have seen only one.	Ngibone eyodwa kuphela.
He would not go anywhere.	Wayengeke aye ndawo.
No, not at all.	Cha, hhayi yedwa ngokuphelele.
He told police, however.	Watshela amaphoyisa, kodwa .
Not just for you.	Hhayi ngawe kuphela.
He looked completely surprised, but not in a bad way.	Wayebukeka emangele ngokuphelele, kodwa hhayi ngendlela embi.
Maybe it would be quick, maybe not.	Mhlawumbe kungaba ngokushesha, mhlawumbe hhayi.
Very good and all that.	Kuhle kakhulu futhi konke lokho.
He says a few things.	Usho izinto ezimbalwa.
In fact, it is better.	Empeleni, kungcono.
All redesign.	Konke ukwenza kabusha.
And you can always do that.	Futhi ungakwenza njalo lokho.
I think thinking.	Ngicabanga ukucabanga.
But it did not last long.	Kodwa akazange ahlale isikhathi eside.
She's beautiful and like you.	Muhle futhi ufana nawe.
And his family, too.	Nomndeni wakhe, futhi.
No one else did.	Akekho omunye owenza kanjalo.
That's the whole problem.	Inkinga yonke leyo .
Maybe to make time go by faster.	Mhlawumbe ukwenza isikhathi sihambe ngokushesha.
He wondered if she had told the truth.	Wayecabanga ukuthi akhulume iqiniso yini.
If many.	Uma abaningi.
I didn't know what to do at the time.	Ngangingazi ukuthi ngenzeni ngaleso sikhathi.
It's better though.	Kungcono kodwa.
You say that because you think you should.	Usho lokho ngoba ucabanga ukuthi kufanele.
He was not sure if this would be good for him.	Wayengenaso isiqiniseko sokuthi lokhu kuzoba kuhle kuye.
But a little bit like that.	Kodwa kancane kanjalo.
This is probably the worst reason.	Lesi mhlawumbe isizathu esibi.
And yes this is difficult.	Futhi yebo lokhu kunzima.
You and I should never go through it.	Mina nawe akufanele neze sihambe kukho.
And it probably is.	Futhi kungenzeka ukuthi kunjalo.
I have never seen how he does that.	Angikaze ngibone ukuthi ukwenza kanjani lokho.
He should not be anything.	Akufanele abe lutho.
I don't want to tell you.	Angifuni ukukutshela.
But it is not just a good idea.	Kodwa akuwona nje umqondo omuhle.
Not just in the room but always.	Hhayi nje ekamelweni kodwa ngaso sonke isikhathi.
This is true, but it is not a bad thing.	Lokhu kuyiqiniso, kodwa akuyona into embi.
Yet now it seems.	Noma kunjalo manje kubonakala.
Exactly as he should have.	Impela njengoba kufanele abe nakho.
Yes it is my fault.	Yebo iphutha lami.
Is he the only one.	Ngabe uyena yedwa.
I'm surprised you're just walking alone.	Ngiyamangala ukuthi uhamba wedwa nje.
He first tried it.	Waqala wazama ngakho.
Still you know what this could be.	Noma kunjalo uyazi ukuthi lokhu kungaba yini.
I'm glad you made a new friend.	Ngiyajabula ukuthi wenze umngane omusha.
What and where.	Yini futhi kuphi.
I had no idea how I was feeling.	Ngangingazi ukuthi ngizizwa kanjani.
And that's what always happens.	Futhi yilokho okwenzeka njalo.
You only want to play.	Ufuna ukudlala kuphela.
It's been almost a week.	Cishe sekuphele isonto lonke.
He now asked my name.	Njengamanje wabuza igama lami.
He took my place.	Wathatha indawo yami.
Maybe a job.	Mhlawumbe umsebenzi.

How, it is very difficult.	Kanjani, kunzima kakhulu.
In this case, time.	Kulokhu, isikhathi .
That's very well done.	Lokho kwenziwe kahle kakhulu.
But it sounds real to me.	Kodwa kuzwakala kuyiqiniso kimi.
So he decided for us, for me.	Ngakho wanquma ngathi, ngami.
I think it should have happened.	Ngicabanga ukuthi bekufanele kwenzeke.
To you, though.	Kuwe, noma kunjalo.
I'm doing that now.	Ngenza lokho manje.
There is so much, so much more to be done here.	Kuningi, okuningi okudingeka kwenziwe lapha.
You are a new person to this.	Ungumuntu omusha kulokhu.
And you will be fine.	Futhi uzohamba kahle.
It has to be something.	Kufanele kube okuthile.
He probably wouldn't say anything.	Cishe ubengeke asho lutho.
So I did.	Ngakho ngenza.
He started like you.	Waqala njengawe.
He slowly agreed.	Wavuma kancane kancane.
You will have to find another one.	Kuzofanele uthole enye.
That just isn't true.	Lokho nje akulona iqiniso.
She's beautiful, too.	Muhle, futhi.
I was not too happy about that.	Angizange ngijabule kakhulu ngalokho.
Still.	Namanje .
However, this is not always the case.	Noma kunjalo, lokhu akunjalo ngaso sonke isikhathi.
Not the other way around.	Akuyona enye indlela.
You need to think for a long time.	Udinga ukucabanga isikhathi eside.
I just can't go.	Ngeke nje ngihambe.
He should have done such a thing.	Kwakufanele enze into enjalo.
He knows everything before it happens.	Wazi konke ngaphambi kokuba kwenzeke.
There is really no right answer here.	Ayikho ngempela impendulo efanele lapha.
I didn't know why, that's right.	Bengazi ukuthi kungani, kunjalo.
I'm just trying to go home.	Ngizama nje ukuya ekhaya.
His mind thought.	Umqondo wakhe wacabanga.
Not that he tried to make one.	Hhayi ukuthi wazama ukwenza eyodwa.
But please tell me what you are talking about.	Kodwa ngicela ungitshele ukuthi ukhuluma ngani.
He is here to help us.	Ulapha ukuze asisize.
We should do so now.	Kufanele senze kanjalo manje.
I just like to see that.	Ngithanda nje ukubona lokho.
You must.	Kumelwe naye.
But we need more.	Kodwa sidinga okwengeziwe.
You need a lot of people to get to where you are.	Udinga abantu abaningi ukuze ufike lapho ukhona.
I can't find anything about it anymore.	Angikwazi ukuthola lutho ngakho futhi.
So now you have to tell me your story.	Ngakho manje kufanele ungitshele indaba yakho.
Who wants money.	Ubani ofuna imali.
You probably do not want to have that.	Cishe awufuni ukuba nalokho.
Not in danger.	Hhayi engozini.
We will not make a mistake.	Ngeke senze iphutha.
And the best thing is, you can easily do that.	Futhi into engcono kakhulu, ungakwenza kalula lokho.
However, it was not done.	Noma kunjalo, akuzange kwenziwe.
I don't think so, but you can't.	Angicabangi kanjalo, kodwa awukwazi.
To create a new life.	Ukwenza impilo entsha.
You have to do something more.	Kufanele wenze okuthile okwengeziwe.
It is time for you to find the truth.	Sekuyisikhathi sokuthi uthole iqiniso.
But there is another way.	Kodwa kukhona futhi enye indlela.
This, or that.	Lokhu, noma lokho.
You can do that at home.	Ungakwenza lokho ekhaya.
You feel alone.	Uzizwa uwedwa.
Through his work.	Ngomsebenzi wakhe.
Lots of time for us.	Isikhathi esiningi kithi.
Where or how.	Kuphi noma kanjani.
So again, thank you very much.	Ngakho futhi, ngiyabonga kakhulu.
To his surprise he refused.	Wamangala ngokuthi wenqaba.
He knew better.	Wayazi kahle.
So many mistakes.	Amaphutha amaningi kangaka.
But yes, it really is.	Kodwa yebo, kunjalo ngempela.
For the good of us.	Ukuze kube kuhle kithi.
I want to give up.	Ngifuna ukuyeka phezulu.
She likes to be alone.	Uthanda ukuba yedwa.
He began to speak quickly.	Waqala wakhuluma ngokushesha.
I even ate dinner.	Ngisho ukudla isidlo sakusihlwa.
That is not the case at all.	Akulona neze icala.
And just in time, too.	Futhi nje ngesikhathi, futhi.
Not if you live.	Hhayi uma uhlala.
You bought that too.	Uthenge nalokho.
I want to hear more.	Ngifuna ukuzwa okwengeziwe.
This is his life.	Impilo yakhe le.
He said no, no.	Wathi cha, cha.
Or maybe a gift.	Noma mhlawumbe isipho.
Very quickly.	Ngokushesha okukhulu.
I mean, he's not in the house.	Ngisho, akekho endlini.
So people say.	Ngakho abantu bathi.
Or actually, too much.	Noma empeleni, kakhulu kakhulu.
She is afraid to say anything.	Uyesaba ukusho okuthile.
Looks like we did.	Kubukeka sengathi senza.
We just have to do it.	Kufanele sikwenze kuphela.
But that is not my problem.	Kodwa akuyona inkinga yami leyo.
I have to stay with him.	Kufanele ngihlale naye.
I had to wait for the police.	Kwadingeka ngihlale ngilinde amaphoyisa.
My voice on that.	Izwi lami kulokho.
And everywhere in between.	Futhi yonke indawo phakathi.
But to continue.	Kodwa ukuqhubeka.
But it should be here soon.	Kodwa kufanele kube lapha maduze.
The boy sat down.	Umfana wahlala.
But he can do things.	Kodwa angenza izinto.
He must know more.	Kumelwe azi okwengeziwe.
A friend of mine bought a book.	Umngane wami uthenge incwadi.
But he could not continue.	Kodwa akakwazanga ukuqhubeka njalo.
Whatever happens right now.	Noma ngabe kwenzekani njengamanje.
It might be that.	Kungase kube yilokho.
Or at least for a while.	Noma okungenani isikhashana eside.
So your problem.	Ngakho inkinga yakho.
That is not the way to do it.	Akuyona indlela yokwenza kanjalo.
I want to be there yesterday.	Ngifuna ukuba khona izolo.
I think he feels the same way.	Ngicabanga ukuthi naye uzizwa ngendlela efanayo.
I can read well people.	Ngikwazi kahle ukufunda abantu.
A bad idea in the way you think.	Umbono omubi ngendlela ocabanga ngayo.
It would probably be much easier.	Cishe kungaba lula kakhulu.
Is this possible.	Kungenzeka yini lokhu .
I want to fix it, too.	Ngifuna ukulungisa, nami.
My father was not in town.	Ubaba wayengekho edolobheni.
I need to be with my family.	Ngidinga ukuba nomndeni wami.
Not because he wants to.	Hhayi ngoba efuna.
No, it will not.	Cha, ngeke kwenzeke.
He did my job.	Wenza umsebenzi wami.
I just think it could be me.	Ngicabanga nje ukuthi kungaba yimina.
I cannot walk or sit or sleep.	Angikwazi ukuhamba noma ukuhlala noma ukulala.
He wants meat.	Ufuna inyama.
You’re not just completely me.	Awuyena nje ngokuphelele kimi.
We have to go to him.	Kumele siye kuye.
I am here to find out more.	Ngilapha ukuze ngithole okwengeziwe.
At least one of your reasons.	Okungenani isizathu sakho esisodwa.
I think that's fine though.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kulungile kodwa.
He looked like he could.	Wayebukeka sengathi angakwazi.
He may go with you.	Angase ahambe nawe.
He wanted more.	Wayefuna okukhulu.
It's not my story.	Akuyona indaba yami .
And he was not.	Futhi wayengekho.
It's been a while.	Kade kukhona isikhashana.
So I'm sure about him.	Ngakho ngiqinisekile ngaye.
And that's right, for now.	Futhi kunjalo, okwamanje.
No, it is not food at all.	Cha, akukhona neze ukudla.
Or like this.	Noma kanje.
You do not want to be in the background.	Awufuni ukuba ngemuva.
I will not do this again.	Ngeke ngenze lokhu futhi.
And you should be.	Futhi kufanele ube njalo.
It is good to do the work.	Kuhle ukwenza umsebenzi.
Maybe you should stay.	Mhlawumbe kufanele uhlale.
In the office, there all morning.	Ehhovisi, lapho ekuseni yonke.
I thought it was dinner.	Bengicabanga ukuthi isidlo sakusihlwa.
Good at work.	Kuhle emsebenzini.
Or, almost,.	Noma, cishe, .
And you do not have to know.	Futhi akudingekile ukuba ukwazi.
I will make this happen as soon as possible.	Ngizokwenza lokhu kwenzeke ngokushesha ngangokunokwenzeka.
I know how easily this can happen.	Ngiyazi ukuthi lokhu kungenzeka kanjani kalula.
I think you feel the same way.	Ngicabanga ukuthi nawe uzizwa ngendlela efanayo.
Maybe he still doesn't know.	Mhlawumbe namanje akazi.
And that, that's what happens all the time.	Futhi lokho, yilokho okwenzeka ngaso sonke isikhathi.
I think that might be another name.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kungenzeka kube elinye igama.
But there is also the danger.	Kodwa kukhona futhi okubi.
Or in this case, cycling.	Noma kulokhu, ukugibela ibhayisikili.
But there was no one else.	Kodwa wayengekho omunye.
So, good for him.	Ngakho, kuhle kuye.
It can be a friend.	Kungaba umngane.
Slowly, but that's fine.	Kancane kancane, kodwa lokho kuhle.
He was wearing a big coat.	Wayegqoke ijazi elikhulu.
I live there.	Ngihlala lapho.
Why, he wouldn't say.	Ngani, ubengeke asho.
No, I don't know anything about everything else.	Cha, angazi lutho ngakho konke okunye.
I'm just trying to play with it.	Ngizama nje ukudlala ngayo.
I do a lot.	Ngenza kakhulu.
At his age.	Eminyakeni yakhe .
We want you to stay there.	Sifuna uhlale lapho.
So we know about it.	Ngakho siyazi ngakho.
That's just me.	Yimi nje leyo.
I only want the biggest.	Ngifuna okukhulu kuphela.
Okay maybe a little bit.	Kulungile mhlawumbe kancane.
I found that very good.	Ngithole ukuthi kuhle kakhulu.
You know you are here with him.	Uyazi ukuthi ulapha naye.
Only because.	Kuphela ngoba .
Well, they say.	Kulungile, bathi.
Choosing three is difficult.	Ukukhetha ezintathu kunzima.
But this is not just a gun.	Kodwa lesi akusona nje isibhamu.
That, too, is fine.	Lokho, nakho, kulungile.
But he never came back.	Kodwa akazange abuye.
Who else, who is better.	Ubani omunye, ubani ongcono.
I think at first, it would be a good thing.	Ngicabanga ukuthi ekuqaleni, kuzoba yinto enhle.
He should eat better.	Kufanele adle kangcono.
Dad is coming home soon.	Ubaba uzofika ekhaya maduze.
You need more time.	Udinga isikhathi esengeziwe esengeziwe.
She went to the bathroom.	Waya endlini encane.
Tell me a little about yourself.	Ngitshele kancane ngawe.
And one did not.	Futhi omunye akazange.
And the wait is definitely worth it.	Futhi ukulinda kufanele nakanjani.
He'll have to be there.	Kuzofanele abe khona.
That seems like a good idea.	Kubonakala sengathi lokho kungaba umqondo omuhle.
I did what your mother did.	Ngenza okwenziwa umama wakho.
Without him.	Ngaphandle kwakhe .
At least now you have to make a choice.	Okungenani manje kufanele wenze ukukhetha.
Anywhere.	Noma kuphi.
Because he doesn't have another ball.	Ngoba akanalo elinye ibhola.
Or with him.	Noma naye.
You need to choose one or the other.	Udinga ukukhetha eyodwa noma enye.
He did not think how he could do that.	Wayengacabangi ukuthi angakwenza kanjani lokho.
Water means life.	Amanzi asho ukuphila.
He should go to prison.	Kufanele aye ejele.
You have that ability.	Unekhono lelo.
Yes, it can be very easy.	Yebo, kungaba lula kakhulu.
I want to think.	Ngifuna ukucabanga.
It's okay to feel pain.	Kulungile ukuzwa ubuhlungu.
He has done a great job so far.	Wenza umsebenzi omkhulu kuze kube manje.
He wanted to talk, not food.	Wayefuna ukukhuluma, hhayi ukudla.
But not almost fast enough.	Kodwa hhayi cishe ngokushesha ngokwanele.
Good time for you.	Isikhathi esihle kuwe.
That's a good case.	Icala elihle kakhulu lelo.
Or maybe there was no one else.	Noma mhlawumbe wayengekho omunye umuntu.
I'm not sure that's a good idea.	Angiqiniseki ukuthi umqondo omuhle lowo.
So you are sure.	Ngalokho uqinisekile.
Still trying.	Noma kunjalo wazama.
Not always yes.	Akekho njalo yebo.
No, not this again.	Cha, hhayi lokhu futhi.
The noise next to him.	Umsindo eduze kwakhe.
As one does.	Njengoba omunye enza.
To be honest, he didn't, either.	Ukukhuluma iqiniso, akazange, futhi.
He is not a boy.	Akayena umfana.
To complete this task.	Ukuqeda lo msebenzi.
You should have done something.	Bekufanele wenze okuthile.
This, of course, is perfectly fine.	Lokhu, kunjalo, kulungile ngokuphelele.
That is true here.	Lokho kuyiqiniso lapha.
It's better for me.	Kungcono nami.
I really know that.	Ngikwazi ngempela lokho.
There is a lot to do there.	Kuningi okumele kwenziwe lapho.
And my choice.	Futhi ukukhetha kwami.
I will not do that.	Ngeke ngikwenze kunjalo.
I know he wants to tell you.	Ngiyazi ufuna ukukutshela yena.
It's okay to talk to us.	Kulungile ukukhuluma nathi.
It's really hard on every move.	Kunzima ngempela kukho konke ukuhamba.
How wonderful it can be.	Kungaba kuhle kanjani.
But you will not stay.	Kodwa ngeke uhlale.
But we have to be friends anyway.	Kodwa kufanele sibe abangane noma kunjalo.
Unless you have done so.	Ngaphandle kokuthi wenze njalo.
Who do you think it will be ?.	Ucabanga ukuthi kuzoba ubani?.
And when he does come, he must remain for a while.	Futhi lapho efika, kumelwe ahlale isikhashana.
I think about it sometimes.	Ngiye ngicabange ngakho ngezinye izikhathi.
But we also know that it just has to be done.	Kodwa futhi siyazi ukuthi kufanele kwenziwe nje.
I want to see that.	Ngifuna ukubona lokho.
He could not stay long in prison.	Wayengeke ahlale isikhathi eside ejele.
He thinks things.	Ucabanga izinto.
He does many things just right.	Wenza izinto eziningi kahle nje.
And enough enough, too.	Futhi ngokwanele ngokwanele, futhi.
But again, your phone.	Kodwa futhi, ucingo lwakho.
I asked to enter.	Ngacela ukungena.
Here he found work.	Lapha wathola umsebenzi.
The idea works like this.	Umbono usebenza kanje.
I didn’t really think much of it.	Angizange ngempela ngicabange kakhulu ngakho.
I have to be busy.	Kufanele ngibe matasa.
No, he is not.	Cha, akuyena umuntu.
We found a good one.	Sithole eyodwa enhle.
Maybe a teacher.	Mhlawumbe uthisha.
I just know what you mean.	Ngiyazi nje ukuthi usho ukuthini.
So do not do this.	Ngakho ungakwenzi lokhu.
That is not really the case.	Lokho akuyona indaba ngempela.
So he sits up there alone.	Ngakho uhlala lapho phezulu yedwa.
I think it would be a good thing.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kungaba yinto enhle.
I know how hard it is sometimes.	Ngiyazi ukuthi kunzima kangakanani ngezinye izikhathi.
I can't wait to see how this happens.	Angikwazi ukulinda ukubona ukuthi lokhu kwenzeka kanjani.
No one is better.	Akekho ongcono.
So he did not have to study.	Ngakho kwakungadingeki ukuba afunde.
But these are children.	Kodwa izingane lezi.
We want to be.	Sifuna ukuba.
Now he would not know.	Manje wayengeke azi.
He said he refused.	Wathi wenqaba.
But when this happened, he did not.	Kodwa lapho lokhu kwenzeka, akazange.
And you want to know more.	Futhi ufuna ukwazi okwengeziwe.
You should go home now.	Kufanele uye ekhaya manje.
And he knew what to do with him, too.	Futhi wayazi ukuthi enzeni ngaye, futhi.
He looked at his name.	Wabheka igama lakhe.
He went to the restaurant.	Waya endlini yokudlela.
I don’t really see how or why.	Angiboni ngempela ukuthi kanjani noma ngani.
That is not all.	Akukhona konke lokho.
I just wanted to smoke.	Ngangifuna nje ukubhema.
And you made a great noise.	Futhi wenze omkhulu umsindo.
But not now.	Kodwa ngeke manje.
I think he is, perhaps, determined.	Ngicabanga ukuthi, mhlawumbe, uzimisele.
It does not mean that something is wrong.	Akusho ukuthi kukhona okwenzekayo.
It is not just one story.	Akuyona nje indaba eyodwa.
I want to cry because you want to cry.	Ngifuna ukukhala ngoba ufuna ukukhala.
I must not do anything at all.	Akumele ngenze lutho nhlobo.
That's exactly the key.	Yilokho ngempela ukhiye.
You do not want anyone to see this immediately.	Awufuni ukuthi omunye umuntu abone lokhu ngokushesha.
Just tell me what happened.	Ngitshele nje ukuthi kwenzekeni.
And that is not just his opinion.	Futhi lokho akuwona umbono wakhe kuphela.
Well, that might be too much.	Kulungile, lokho kungenzeka kube kuningi kakhulu.
It could be hours, or it could be days.	Kungase kube amahora, noma kungaba izinsuku.
He did not really want to do this.	Wayengafuni ngempela ukwenza lokhu.
Three years ago.	Iminyaka emithathu edlule.
Same child.	Ingane efanayo.
Your whole family.	Umndeni wakho wonke.
Stop being tall.	Yeka ukuba mude.
You must have it completely.	Kumelwe ube nakho ngokuphelele.
You look very happy.	Ubonakala ujabule kakhulu.
But that should be the case.	Kodwa lokho kufanele kube njalo.
Done very quickly.	Kwenziwe ngokushesha okukhulu.
We must do it immediately.	Kufanele sikwenze ngokushesha.
He probably can't.	Cishe akakwazi.
And he just did it.	Futhi wavele wakwenza.
It is difficult to choose one.	Kunzima ukukhetha eyodwa.
Or maybe not now, but soon.	Noma mhlawumbe hhayi manje, kodwa maduze.
I couldn’t, really.	Angikwazanga, ngempela.
He knew what he had done.	Wayazi ukuthi wenzeni.
And the sound is very good.	Futhi umsindo muhle kakhulu.
I don't have much time.	Anginaso isikhathi eside.
You can't see.	Awukwazi ukubona.
But it seems right to me.	Kodwa kubonakala kulungile kimi.
No, it should have been here.	Cha, bekumele kube lapha.
He wanted to leave, because he tried to play too much.	Wayefuna ukuhamba, ngoba wazama ukudlala kakhulu.
And he lives here for now.	Futhi uhlala lapha okwamanje.
There is no place on earth.	Akukho ndawo emhlabeni.
But without him.	Kodwa ngaphandle kwakhe.
But there is a story.	Kodwa kukhona indaba.
Lots of extra food.	Ukudla okuningi okwengeziwe.
Just like that, that's right.	Kanjalo nje, kunjalo.
I think he can have it.	Ngicabanga ukuthi angaba nakho.
I mean, really, almost never.	Ngisho, ngempela, cishe neze.
We both know it to be true.	Sobabili siyazi ukuthi kuyiqiniso.
He asked for a place for both of us.	Wacela indawo kithi sobabili.
Everyone walks around talking.	Wonke umuntu uhamba ekhuluma.
But we will not do that immediately.	Kodwa ngeke sikwenze lokhu ngaso leso sikhathi.
Not really my name.	Akulona igama lami empeleni.
Sounds bad to me.	Kuzwakala kabi kimi.
Great story, too.	Indaba enkulu, futhi.
He could not do this with our family.	Akakwazanga ukwenza lokhu nomndeni wethu.
You probably know about that.	Kungenzeka uyazi ngalokho.
You look and feel the best today.	Ubukeka futhi uzizwa engcono kakhulu namuhla.
When to say.	Nini ukusho.
But if anything happens to me you will know.	Kodwa uma kukhona okwenzeka kimi uzokwazi.
No, now, no one.	Akukho, manje, akukho muntu.
Great place next to everything.	Indawo enhle eduze kwakho konke.
He never came to my house.	Akakaze afike endlini yami.
Still it is not a story.	Noma kunjalo akuyona indaba.
This is your thing.	Into yakho lena.
But that did not really happen.	Kodwa lokho akuzange kwenzeke ngempela.
And without me.	Futhi ngaphandle kwami.
There is somebody here now.	Kukhona omunye umuntu lapha manje.
It's good that he's back.	Kuhle ukuthi abuye.
That sounds like a terrible thing.	Sengathi yinto embi leyo.
If it's going to happen, it's going to happen.	Uma kuzokwenzeka, kuzokwenzeka.
What really happened to him no one knows.	Kwenzekani ngempela kuye akekho owaziyo.
I mean it's possible.	Ngisho ukuthi kungenzeka.
But only once at a time.	Kodwa kanye kuphela ngesikhathi.
More now.	Okuningi manje.
No, too much! 	Cha, kuningi kakhulu!
But that must happen.	Kodwa kumelwe ukuba kwenzeka into enjalo.
You know it's me.	Uyazi ukuthi yimina.

But right now everything sounds real.	Kodwa njengamanje konke kuzwakala kuyiqiniso.
Not to me, to you.	Hhayi kimi, kuwe.
That will not happen, of course.	Lokho ngeke kwenzeke, kunjalo.
He wants to stay close to her.	Ufuna ukuhlala eduze kwakhe.
No need now.	Asikho isidingo manje.
Debugging.	Ukulungisa amaphutha.
But most of the time, it is not.	Kodwa isikhathi esiningi, akunjalo.
But not just me.	Kodwa hhayi mina kuphela.
I certainly did in the beginning.	Impela ngenza ekuqaleni.
Same thing there.	Into efanayo lapho.
You will have it all.	Uzoba nakho konke.
He always talks to himself.	Ukhuluma yedwa njalo.
In the end it means nothing.	Ekugcineni akusho lutho.
Me and you, now.	Mina nawe, manje.
I have lived too long.	Ngihlale isikhathi eside kakhulu.
He thought as before.	Wayecabanga njengakuqala.
Not so now.	Akunjalo namanje.
It can be front or rear.	Kungaba ngaphambili noma ngemuva.
Everything is fine.	Kuhle konke.
He's a really big guy.	Uyinsizwa enkulu impela.
He realized everything about her.	Waqaphela konke ngaye.
So, tell me first.	Ngakho, ungitshele kuqala.
She looked bad about him.	Wayebukeka kabi ngaye.
My mother would not do that.	Umama ubengeke akwenze lokho.
And great, whatever it will be.	Futhi okukhulu, noma ngabe kuzoba yini.
Always a good time.	Isikhathi esihle njalo.
I was thinking hard.	Bengicabanga kanzima.
Great case.	Icala elikhulu .
Anyone does that.	Noma ubani wenza kanjalo.
You look happy to me, actually.	Ubukeka ujabule kimi, empeleni.
Only hope.	Ithemba kuphela.
I just have to do my job.	Kumele ngenze umsebenzi wami nje.
I mean that's one thing.	Ngisho ukuthi yinto eyodwa leyo.
He did that yesterday, actually.	Ukwenze lokho izolo, empeleni.
And you do not have to stay all the time.	Futhi akudingekile ukuhlala isikhathi sonke.
And that and this.	Futhi lokho nalokhu.
I've heard of you both my whole life.	Ngike ngizwe ngawe nobabili impilo yami yonke.
He knew exactly how he felt.	Wayazi kahle ukuthi uzizwa kanjani.
This is money.	Imali lena.
So no one.	Ngakho akukho muntu.
There will be no one else there.	Ngeke kube khona omunye lapho.
And thank you very much and thank you very much.	Futhi ngiyabonga kakhulu futhi ngiyabonga ngiyabonga.
You have to be something.	Kufanele ube okuthile.
I do not want her to be able to do that.	Angifuni ukuthi akwazi ukwenza lokho.
Or many things.	Noma izinto eziningi.
Still, it is not stupid.	Noma kunjalo, akusona isilima.
And there is always.	Futhi kukhona njalo.
And, maybe some food.	Futhi, mhlawumbe okunye ukudla.
I did not have to wait long.	Akuzange kudingeke ngilinde isikhathi eside.
No, he is not.	Cha, akuyena neze umuntu.
You just think too much.	Ucabanga kakhulu nje.
He said he knew this.	Wathi uyakwazi lokhu.
He knows a lot of people in the city.	Wazi abantu abaningi edolobheni.
He went with me everywhere.	Wahamba nami yonke indawo.
Or his friends.	Noma abangani bakhe.
Just a moment.	Ukukhuluma nje isikhashana.
As if it were his fault.	Sengathi iphutha lakhe.

You have made a choice.	Wenze ukukhetha.
Even if all of that is true.	Noma ngabe konke lokho kuyiqiniso.
You do not know what happened.	Ubungazi ukuthi kwenzekeni.
Not money.	Hhayi imali.
Today it seems to be another life.	Namuhla kubonakala sengathi enye impilo.
I think we all know why.	Ngicabanga ukuthi sonke siyazi ukuthi kungani.
He didn't look very good to her.	Wayengabonakali kahle kuye.
I wanted to see outside.	Bengifuna ukubona ngaphandle.
What happened to him means nothing.	Okwenzeka kuye akusho lutho.
She tries to say something, but she can't.	Uzama ukusho okuthile, kodwa akakwazi.
And how is that possible.	Futhi kungenzeka kanjani.
But, please do anything right now.	Kodwa, ngicela wenze noma yini njengamanje.

He also lives here.	Naye uhlala lapha.
I have to say this before we go.	Kufanele ngisho lokhu ngaphambi kokuthi sihambe.
There is actually nothing in between.	Empeleni akukho lutho phakathi.
I feel sure he will be back.	Ngizizwa ngiqinisekile ukuthi uzobuya.
This is a good place for him.	Lena indawo enhle kuye.
It is not something that stays easy.	Akuyona into ehlala kalula.
Unless you are traveling.	Ngaphandle uma uhamba.
He wanted that too.	Naye wayefuna lokho.
But not so much for us.	Kodwa hhayi kakhulu kithi.
And that might be his biggest problem.	Futhi lokho kungase kube inkinga yakhe enkulu.
Too much, too much.	Kuningi, kuningi kakhulu.
Yes, this can be easy.	Yebo, lokhu kungaba lula.
One eats too much, the other a little.	Omunye udla kakhulu, omunye kancane.
I want to go into his house.	Ngifuna ukungena endlini yakhe.
It's better for him.	Kungcono kuye.
He said he had never been to school recently.	Wathi awukaze uye esikoleni muva nje.

And this is something else.	Futhi lokhu okunye.

He became a new person.	Waba umuntu omusha.
Just to see if you can do it.	Ukubona nje ukuthi ungakwenza yini.

And not just recently.	Futhi hhayi kamuva nje.
I must say that this is true.	Kumele ngisho ukuthi lokhu kuyiqiniso.

He said he knew everything very well.	Wathi wayazi kakhulu yonke into.
And the sooner, the better.	Futhi ngokushesha, kungcono.

You heard him.	Wezwa naye.
Tell the police.	Tshela amaphoyisa.
He never wants to talk.	Akafuni neze ukukhuluma.

This person is here.	Lo muntu lapha.

I really wanted to be there for her.	Ngangifuna ngempela ukuba lapho ngenxa yakhe.
You just know you exist.	Uyazi nje ukuthi ukhona.
He wanted to be here, there, and everywhere.	Wayefuna ukuba lapha, lapho, futhi yonke indawo.
And that's a bad message.	Futhi lowo umlayezo omubi.
Power for me.	Amandla ngami.
And he wanted to know the truth.	Futhi wayefuna ukwazi iqiniso.
It's just not very good.	Akuyona nje enhle kakhulu.
I made a plan.	Ngenza icebo.
I don't think so.	Angicabangi nhlobo.
You really mean it.	Usho ngempela.
He did not want to eat alone.	Wayengafuni ukudla yedwa.
It all hurts.	Konke ubuhlungu.
How fast.	Ngokushesha kangakanani.
So that's great !.	Ngakho kuhle lokho!.
Not the same thing.	Hhayi into efanayo.
And hopefully, so did he.	Futhi ngethemba, kanjalo naye.
You need to live again.	Udinga ukuphila futhi.
Mother in the park.	Umama epaki.
She is a child.	Uyena ingane.
Just a bad accident.	Ingozi embi nje.
Now, sleep.	Manje, ukulala.
Tell me something about yourself.	Ngitshele okuthile ngawe.
You know, by his work.	Uyazi, ngomsebenzi wakhe.
It's hard to imagine why.	Kunzima ukucabanga ukuthi kungani.
Or, maybe.	Noma, mhlawumbe.
He opened now one now another.	Wavula manje omunye manje omunye.
What to do, and so on.	Okufanele ukwenze, futhi kanjalo.
I had to go first.	Bekufanele ngihambe kuqala.
But do as much as you can.	Kodwa ukwenza okuningi ngangokunokwenzeka.
Not always, though not always.	Akunjalo, noma akunjalo ngaso sonke isikhathi.
He just wanted to lie down.	Wayefuna nje ukulala phansi.
My very plan.	Icebo lami impela.
And he got into trouble.	Futhi wangena enkingeni.
Almost worldwide.	Cishe emhlabeni wonke.
This was not a human being.	Lo kwakungeyena umuntu.
I think he can do that.	Ngicabanga ukuthi angakwenza lokho.
But too much, of course.	Kodwa kuningi kakhulu, kunjalo.
I think that's your problem.	Ngicabanga ukuthi inkinga yakho leyo.
But he just wants me to be happy.	Kodwa ufuna nje ngijabule.
Something about.	Okuthile cishe .
His hours should go well.	Amahora akhe kufanele ahambe kahle.
No, you really wouldn't, not now.	Cha, ubengeke ngempela, hhayi manje.
I think this is probably once a week.	Ngicabanga ukuthi lokhu mhlawumbe kanye ngesonto.
But you can do it.	Kodwa ungakwenza.
It would be a lie.	Kungaba amanga nje.
He went again.	Wahamba futhi.
We are not really here.	Asikho ngempela lapha.
He must be able to do it.	Kufanele akwazi ukukwenza.
I think you can do that too.	Ngicabanga ukuthi nawe ungakwenza lokho.
Make us do it.	Senze sikwenze.
I don't think so.	Angicabangi kahle.
Or maybe tomorrow.	Noma mhlawumbe kusasa.
Really, you can't.	Ngempela, awukwazi.
I probably need to think more about this.	Cishe ngidinga ukucabanga okwengeziwe ngale ndaba.
Who did that?!.	Ubani owenza lokho?!.
Don't be me.	Ungabi yimi.
Want to work with us ?.	Ufuna ukusebenza nathi?.
I did this for us.	Ngenze lokhu kithi.
That doesn't mean you can't.	Lokho akusho ukuthi ngeke ube.
And this is just the way it is.	Futhi lokhu kunjalo nje.
But now it is very difficult.	Kodwa manje kunzima kakhulu.
And he did a bad job.	Futhi wenza umsebenzi omubi.
Not too busy at this time.	Akukho matasa kakhulu ngalesi sikhathi.
Definitely not an accident.	Nakanjani akuyona ingozi.
But he has to stay in prison.	Kodwa kumele ahlale ejele.
It's been a long time waiting.	Sekuyisikhathi eside ukulinda.
Demand is not a problem here.	Isidingo akuyona inkinga lapha.
Maybe later, finally.	Mhlawumbe kamuva, ekugcineni.
I don't think he should be alone here.	Angicabangi ukuthi kufanele abe yedwa lapha.
We know that.	Siyazi ukuthi .
So stop trying to make it harder.	Ngakho yeka ukuzama ukwenza kube nzima.
Everyone can read.	Wonke umuntu angakwazi ukufunda.
Not now, not now.	Hhayi manje, hhayi manje.
It looks a little weird.	Kubukeka kancane.
He gave the shoes.	Wanikeza izicathulo.
Some days, he can't go on.	Ngezinye izinsuku, akakwazi ukuqhubeka.
This is my problem, too.	Le nkinga yami, futhi.
Most of the time it won’t be.	Isikhathi esiningi ngeke kube njalo.
At least outside.	Okungenani ngaphandle.
That is not a big mistake.	Lokho akulona iphutha elikhulu.
Sounds a little to me.	Kuzwakala kancane kimi.
Who needs help.	Ubani ofuna usizo.
I never thought it would happen anytime soon.	Bengingacabangi ukuthi kuzokwenzeka maduze nje.
I really can't work.	Angikwazi ngempela ukusebenza.
Maybe you expect to return home.	Mhlawumbe ulindele ukubuyela ekhaya.
If you like it then.	Uma ungathanda kunjalo.
I want you to get an idea.	Ngifuna uthole umqondo.
And this is all happening.	Futhi lokhu kwenzeka konke.
And it all means nothing.	Futhi konke akusho lutho.
So far, and nothing more.	Kuze kube manje, futhi akukho okunye.
All right, that's better.	Kulungile, lokho kungcono.
You can't take a chance.	Awukwazi ukuthatha ithuba.
And no one makes a lot of money by doing that.	Futhi akekho owenza imali eningi ngokwenza lokho.
You don't really need any more.	Awudingi ngempela okunye.
Let me tell you what happened to her.	Ake ngikutshele ngalokho okwenzeka kuye.
Maybe it will happen, maybe it won't.	Mhlawumbe kuzokwenzeka, mhlawumbe ngeke.
I do not remember yet.	Angisakhumbuli okwamanje.
Not all, not yet.	Hhayi yonke, hhayi okwamanje.
And you and you.	Futhi wena kanye nawe.
So he rolled his eyes.	Ngakho wakhipha amehlo.
And one for me.	Futhi eyodwa kimi.
So yes, that's a lot.	Ngakho yebo, kuningi kakhulu.
This really happened to him.	Lokhu kwenzeka ngempela kuye.
And that could be your fault.	Futhi lokho kungaba iphutha lakho.
You will need something.	Uzodinga into.
I did everything right.	Ngenze konke kahle.
He wanted power.	Wayefuna amandla.
The boy is very playful.	Umfana udlala kakhulu.
I don't want anything to happen to it.	Angifuni kwenzeke lutho kukho.
He was really scared.	Ngempela wayesaba.
I know it's you.	Ngiyazi ukuthi nguwe.
Every morning for sure.	Njalo ekuseni nakanjani.
And he did at that moment.	Futhi wenza ngaleso sikhathi.
And make it nice.	Futhi wenze kube kuhle.
All of this happened very quickly, you know.	Konke lokhu kwenzeka ngokushesha okukhulu, uyazi.
It is not just a ball.	Akulona nje ibhola.
I know you will make the right choice.	Ngiyazi ukuthi uzokwenza ukukhetha okufanele.
He hasn't really spoken to me since.	Akazange akhulume nami ngempela kusukela ngaleso sikhathi.
He has done so much work.	Wenze umsebenzi omkhulu kangaka.
He should stop doing it.	Kufanele ayeke ukukwenza.
He did the other one.	Ukwenzile omunye.
Actually a message.	Empeleni umlayezo.
I sit in the back.	Ngihlale ngemuva.
That death, when death.	Ukuthi ukufa, ukufa nini.
Yes, that's my name.	Yebo, igama lami lelo.
That is just my opinion.	Lokho kusobala nje umbono wami.
Good news so far.	Indaba enhle kuze kube manje.
Why it might be so.	Kungani kungase kube njalo.
He went with us.	Wahamba nathi.
Can you cook.	Ungakwazi yini ukupheka.
You will need more later.	Uzodinga okuningi kamuva.
Maybe it was my fault.	Mhlawumbe kube iphutha lami.
And this, of course, is what happened.	Futhi lokhu, kunjalo, yilokho okwenzeka.
I wanted everything and everyone left.	Ngangifuna yonke into futhi wonke umuntu ahambe.
Yes, that's his name.	Yebo, igama lakhe lelo.
I'd love to hear what you have to say.	Ngithanda ukuzwa ukuthi uthini.
That is indeed a good question.	Empeleni umbuzo omuhle lowo.
Probably not a big deal if there is one.	Cishe akuyona into enkulu uma kukhona.
No, I know too.	Cha, nami ngiyazi.
Do you feel good, do you feel.	Ingabe uzizwa kahle, ingabe uzizwa.
Finally this morning.	Ekugcineni namhlanje ekuseni.
You don't have to do that anyway.	Akumele wenze lokho noma kunjalo.
It is here in the city.	Kukhona lapha edolobheni .
Please win.	Ngicela awine.
Good night.	Kuhle namhlanje ebusuku.
And well done.	Futhi kwenziwe kahle.
He is very similar to me in that.	Ufana kakhulu nami kulokho.
That's my car.	Imoto yami leyo.
I think it's really good.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kuhle ngempela.
I talked to him downstairs.	Ngikhulume naye phansi.
But not this place.	Kodwa hhayi le ndawo.
He should not be there.	Akufanele abe lapho.
The father deserves the boy.	Ubaba kufanele umfana.
He thinks he means his name.	Ucabanga ukuthi usho igama lakhe.
But that is not at all what happens here.	Kodwa lokho akukhona ngokuphelele okwenzeka lapha.
You will not tell anyone where it is.	Ngeke utshele muntu ukuthi kuphi.
This did not happen, of course.	Lokhu akuzange kwenzeke, kunjalo.
He really wanted her.	Wayefuna kakhulu kuye.
And he does that every day.	Futhi wenza lokho nsuku zonke.
Okay, maybe a few.	Kulungile, mhlawumbe ezimbalwa.
Each time'.	Ngaso sonke isikhathi'.
Down in the city.	Phansi edolobheni.
He would really like it.	Angathanda ngempela.
He did not seek a new family.	Akazange afune umndeni omusha.
Finally, he started.	Ekugcineni, waqala.
He never spoke in class.	Akakaze akhulume ekilasini.
I want you to always know that.	Ngifuna uhlale ukwazi lokho.
No matter what happens, you sit down.	Noma ngabe kwenzekani, uhlala phansi.
I never knew before what that could be.	Angikaze ngazi ngaphambili ukuthi kungaba yini lokho.
Now he came back to her.	Manje wabuyela kuye.
That you should have been here.	Ukuthi bekufanele ube lapha.
That would be death.	Lokho kungaba ukufa.
I don't think so.	Angicabangi kanjalo nje.
There is actually something else going on.	Empeleni kukhona okunye okwenzekayo.
This work does three things.	Lo msebenzi wenza izinto ezintathu.
All of this is probably true.	Kungenzeka ukuthi konke lokhu kuyiqiniso.
I can't say enough of that.	Ngeke ngisho ngokwanele lokho.
Previously.	Ngaphambili .
I want to be that way.	Ngifuna ukuba njalo.
I can't take anything yet.	Ngeke ngikwazi ukuthatha okunye okwamanje.
I did it all by myself.	Konke ngikwenze ngedwa.
That doesn't mean anything right now.	Lokho akusho lutho njengamanje.
Thinking behind your back.	Ukucabanga ngemuva kwakho.
That's right, at first.	Kunjalo, ekuqaleni.
I'll go the other way.	Ngizohamba enye indlela.
Maybe it's possible too.	Mhlawumbe kungenzeka futhi.
I also do not want to be a father right now.	Nami angifuni ukuba ubaba njengamanje.
He wanted her to get there.	Wayefuna ukuthi afike khona lapho.
She has no hope.	Akanalo ithemba.
I think he stayed in his room.	Ngicabanga ukuthi wahlala ekamelweni lakhe.
I like playing tennis.	Ngithanda ukudlala ithenisi.
Not only do I not know.	Hhayi nje angazi.
Yes, now and then.	Yebo, manje futhi.
And this one is small.	Futhi lena encane.
He once was.	Wake waba njalo .
You want to do something about it.	Ufuna ukwenza okuthile ngakho.
But sometimes it can be really hard to read.	Kodwa ngezinye izikhathi kungase kube nzima ngempela ukufunda.
No, really, you read that well.	Cha, ngempela, ufunda lokho kahle.
Certainly no other way.	Impela ayikho enye indlela.
Probably too.	Mhlawumbe naye.
I'm sorry to say that.	Ngiyaxolisa ukusho ukuthi kunjalo.
Sure to do.	Uqinisekile ukwenza.
First, bad.	Okokuqala, okubi.
My girlfriend is not there.	Intombi yami ayikho.
Looks like you did too.	Kubukeka sengathi nawe wenze njalo.
Because that would be a very good thing.	Ngoba lokho kuzoba yinto enhle kakhulu.
Sometimes it is very difficult.	Ngezinye izikhathi kunzima kakhulu.
Not always in the world.	Hhayi ngaso sonke isikhathi emhlabeni.
That’s what he said, though.	Yilokho akusho, noma kunjalo.
There is no reason to say that.	Asikho isizathu sokuthi .
He was not a friend at all.	Wayengeyena nhlobo umngane.
There is not much thinking in that.	Akukho ukucabanga okuningi kulokho.
Your mother, however.	Umama wakho, kodwa.
He should not have told her, at all.	Bekungafanele atshele, nakancane.
Probably in his world.	Mhlawumbe emhlabeni wakhe.
It is very difficult to live here.	Kunzima kakhulu ukuphila lapha.
It's you.	Nguwe wena.
Maybe stay.	Mhlawumbe ukuhlala.
You do not really want to work there.	Awufuni ngempela ukusebenza lapho.
We can't go there.	Asikwazi ukuya lapho.
I'm not sure you can.	Angiqiniseki ukuthi ungakwenza.
He once did it once.	Wake wakwenza kanye.
And too bad.	Futhi embi kabi.
At least, almost.	Okungenani, cishe.
Or a few.	Noma ezimbalwa.
He couldn't think of that.	Akakwazanga ukucabanga ngalokho.
Very little, really.	Kancane kakhulu, empeleni.
Not someone in the room.	Hhayi umuntu ekamelweni.
Then again it will not.	Khona futhi angeke.
Just the two of you.	Nobabili nje.
He said yes.	Wathi kunjalo.
I can make it better.	Ngingakwenza kube kuhle.
It seems like yesterday.	Kubonakala sengathi izolo.
Every call.	Njalo ucingo.
You know, this is just once.	Uyazi, lokhu kanye nje.
That or crying.	Lokho noma ukukhala.
I just wanted to make sure.	Bengifuna nje ukwenza isiqiniseko.
I never saw a good person.	Angizange ngibone umuntu omuhle.
And maybe we did.	Futhi mhlawumbe senze.
I thought nothing of it.	Ngangingacabangi lutho.
It will be a new person.	Kuzoba umuntu omusha.
Party, party, party.	Iphathi, iphathi, iphathi.
He just couldn't be.	Wayengeke nje abe.
I can't tell you his name.	Angikwazi ukukutshela igama lakhe.
He did not know what would happen.	Wayengazi ukuthi kuzoba yini.
I have never done it or I will do it.	Angikaze ngikwenze noma ngizokwenza.
You should have thought about it earlier.	Bekumele ucabange ngakho kusenesikhathi.
Because everyone knows it's true.	Ngoba wonke umuntu uyazi ukuthi kuyiqiniso.
But if you do, that's fine.	Kodwa uma wenza, kuhle.
We want to stay here for a while first.	Sifuna ukuhlala lapha isikhashana kuqala.
But he would not know.	Kodwa wayengeke azi.
We all know he will.	Sonke siyazi ukuthi uzokwenza.
Tonight dinner alone.	Namuhla kusihlwa isidlo sakusihlwa uwedwa.
Everyone makes mistakes.	Wonke umuntu wenza amaphutha.
Everyone wanted to be there.	Wonke umuntu wayefuna ukuba lapho.
I have had to do that for the rest of my life.	Kuye kwadingeka ngikwenze lokho ukuphila kwami ​​konke.
You have already opened the window.	Usevele wavula iwindi.
So, he did not.	Ngakho, akazange.
But something had to be done.	Kodwa kwakufanele kwenziwe okuthile.
He wanted to get back in the car.	Wayefuna ukubuyela emotweni.
But it will not happen, at least not for long.	Kodwa ngeke kwenzeke, okungenani hhayi isikhathi eside.
Not immediately, and not for days.	Hhayi ngokushesha, futhi hhayi izinsuku.
I could not stay that long.	Angikwazanga ukuhlala isikhathi eside kangako.
He saw that it was him.	Wabona ukuthi nguye.
But that was not the case.	Kodwa kwakungeyena lowo.
But it is not.	Kodwa akuyena.
Something about him.	Okuthile ngaye .
It really has to be that way.	Kufanele kube njalo ngempela.
I didn’t know how but.	Ngangingazi ukuthi kanjani kodwa.
He was not sure what else he should do.	Wayengenaso isiqiniseko sokuthi yini enye okufanele ayenze.
Nothing more, nothing more.	Akukho okunye, akukho okunye.
I thought of you today.	Ngicabange ngawe namuhla.
And one for you.	Futhi eyodwa ngawe.
But we need to leave soon.	Kodwa kudingeka sihambe maduze.
Then your father.	Khona ubaba wakho.
If you feel like yourself.	Uma uzizwa njengawe.
I will not go to town tomorrow.	Ngeke ngiye edolobheni kusasa.
I think you need to learn something.	Ngicabanga ukuthi udinga ukufunda okuthile.
Now he began to enter.	Manje waqala ukungena.
Maybe longer.	Mhlawumbe eside.
I'm happy about it now.	Ngiyajabula ngakho manje.
It might be, he thought.	Kungase kube njalo, wacabanga.
But it will be temporary.	Kodwa kuzoba isikhashana.
Your new life.	Impilo yakho entsha.
You will need life.	Uzodinga impilo.
He went to the office.	Waya ehhovisi.
Everyone is scared.	Wonke umuntu uyesaba.
That, of course, is not the case here.	Lokho, kunjalo, akunjalo lapha.
He came in anyway.	Wangena kunjalo.
I mean, really good.	Ngisho ngempela, kuhle ngempela.
He looked at the group.	Wabuka iqembu.
And you know, it's not really me.	Futhi uyazi, akukhona ngempela kimi.
It looks absolutely fine.	Kubonakala kuhle ngokuphelele.
It's hard to quit smoking if you like.	Kunzima ukuyeka ukubhema uma uthanda.
I need to go myself.	Ngidinga ukuhamba mina.
But this was to be the case.	Kodwa lokhu kwakufanele kube njalo.
I found out you were wrong.	Ngithole ukuthi unephutha.
In the end, it is.	Ekugcineni, kunjalo.
Not just good.	Hhayi nje kuhle.
But that is not the only reason.	Kodwa akusona isizathu leso kuphela.
Not at all, he wanted to say.	Hhayi neze, wayefuna ukusho.
And that's almost all.	Futhi lokho cishe konke.
He could not come.	Akakwazanga ukuza.
I do not know everything.	Angikwazi konke.
I could not find the problem.	Angikwazanga ukuthola inkinga.
I don't think you really want that.	Angicabangi ukuthi ngempela ufuna lokho.

That should be the case.	Okufanele kube njalo.
I even need it.	Ngisho isidingo.
That too is obvious.	Lokho futhi kusobala.
For good.	Ukuze kube kuhle.
I'm not this one.	Angiyena lo.
Maybe he can make sense of it.	Mhlawumbe angenza umqondo ngakho.
Location.	Indawo .
I think bad.	Ngicabanga okubi.
It might be too good, too.	Kungase kube kulungile kakhulu, futhi.
There is always a chance.	Kukhona njalo ithuba.
I got a job there.	Ngithole umsebenzi lapho.
It's been too much.	Kube kuningi kakhulu.

My mother did not come.	Umama akazange afike.
No, he said, you better not do it.	Cha, uthe, kungcono ungakwenzi.
No one wants to see that.	Akekho ofuna ukubona lokho.
She felt bad for him.	Wazizwa kabi ngaye.
I'm glad you did well at home.	Ngiyajabula ukuthi wenze kahle ekhaya.
This can be very simple.	Lokhu kungaba lula kakhulu.
In a place not here.	Endaweni engekho lapha.

And in this case, stay.	Futhi kulokhu, ukuhlala.
We all want something.	Sonke sifuna okuthile.
Not that you are worried.	Hhayi ukuthi ukhathazekile.

I will never really know.	Angisoze ngazi ngempela.
But he is not here now.	Kodwa akekho lapha manje.
I want to stay this way for a while.	Ngifuna ukuhlala kanje isikhashana.
He was probably thinking a lot.	Cishe wayecabanga kakhulu.
But his presence was totally unnecessary.	Kodwa ukuba khona kwakhe kwakungadingeki neze.
It should be easy enough to do.	Kufanele kube lula ngokwanele ukukwenza.
You just think you know, really.	Ucabanga nje ukuthi uyazi, empeleni.
You do not know which book it is.	Awukwazi ukuthi iyiphi incwadi.
But nothing was needed.	Kodwa akukho okwakudingeka.
I do not want to eat.	Angifuni ukudla.
Obviously, it will be better tomorrow.	Ngokusobala, kuzoba ngcono kusasa.
This happens all the time.	Lokhu kwenzeka ngaso sonke isikhathi.
He said he needed a place.	Wathi udinga indawo.
I thought for a moment.	Ngacabanga kancane.
He should never have come here.	Bekungafanele neze eze lapha.
At least he.	Okungenani yena.
Bad opinion of him.	Umbono omubi ngaye.
John could not continue and did not try.	UJohn akakwazanga ukuqhubeka futhi akazange azame.
I actually don't remember.	Empeleni angisakhumbuli.
I'm sorry to say that.	Ngiyaxolisa ukusho kanjalo.
I will not do that.	Ngeke ngikwenze kulokho.
It is not your place.	Akuyona indawo yakho.

The doctor said it was okay.	Udokotela wathi kulungile.
I would love to hear your opinion !.	Ngingathanda ukuzwa umbono wakho!.
Nice to see you though.	Kuhle ukukubona kodwa.
He may be a very bad person.	Angase abe yinto embi kabi.
Everyone seems very happy.	Wonke umuntu ubonakala ejabule kakhulu.
Recently he has not been able to sing in bed.	Muva nje akakwazanga ukucula embhedeni.
I doubt you will be able to.	Ngiyangabaza ukuthi uzokwazi.
Yes, and yes.	Yebo, futhi yebo.
In fact, that is not even the question.	Empeleni, lowo akuwona ngisho umbuzo.
We did this together.	Lokhu sikwenze ndawonye.
There is no one else in the area.	Akekho omunye endaweni.
Now he has to go without me.	Manje kuzomele ahambe ngaphandle kwami.
My father lived in a big house.	Ubaba wahlala endlini enkulu.
That is why.	Yingakho .
He could not create the image.	Akakwazanga ukwenza isithombe.
This is not a bad thing at all.	Lena akuyona indlela embi ngempela.
You're kidding us.	Udlala ngathi.
Everyone watched.	Wonke umuntu wabuka.
You do not need to make a decision right now.	Awudingi ukwenza isinqumo manje.
And he did that.	Futhi ukwenzile lokho.
You are alone with that.	Uwedwa ngalokho.
Not wanting anyone else to know.	Engafuni noma ubani omunye azi.
He couldn't do much about it.	Akakwazanga ukwenza okuningi ngakho.
It probably won't last long.	Cishe ngeke ahlale isikhathi eside.
As it will be for you.	Njengoba kuzoba njalo kuwe.
He would not do that to me.	Ubengeke akwenze lokho kimi.
This should always happen.	Lokhu kumele kwenzeke ngaso sonke isikhathi.
This afternoon, that happened.	Namuhla ntambama, lokho kwenzeke.
Let me tell you everything.	Ake ngikutshele yonke into.
I'm just trying to help.	Ngizama nje ukusiza.
I really wouldn't have done this without him.	Empeleni bengingeke ngikwenze lokhu ngaphandle kwakhe.
But it will be good.	Kodwa kuzoba kuhle.
Maybe someone nearby saw a car.	Mhlawumbe othile eduze wabona imoto.
He did it before.	Ukwenzile ngaphambili.
You feel it with him.	Wazizwa naye.
He knew where he needed to go.	Wayazi lapho okwakudingeka aye khona.
More money is needed.	Kudingeka imali eningi.
One had to learn from that.	Umuntu bekufanele afunde kulokho.
I was thinking the same thing last week.	Bengicabanga into efanayo ngesonto eledlule.
I did not want to go home.	Ngangingafuni ukuya ekhaya.
Man is always on the move.	Umuntu uhlala ehamba.

You work here, you know.	Usebenza lapha, uyazi.
No you can't, not like this.	Cha awukwazi, hhayi kanje.
He could not choose, and he could not speak.	Akakwazanga ukukhetha, futhi akakwazanga ukukhuluma.

We have made that clear time and time again.	Sikwenze kwacaca lokho isikhathi nesikhathi.

What are you doing now.	Wenzani manje.
Well, he didn't even know he was here.	Hhayi, wayengazi nokuthi ukhona yini lapha.

I didn't have to think about that.	Kwakungadingeki ngicabange ngalokho.
Very, very sorry.	Kakhulu, ngiyaxolisa kakhulu.

And he will never exist again.	Futhi ngeke aphinde abe khona.
Very similar story.	Indaba efanayo kakhulu.
He could not finish speaking.	Akakwazanga ukuqeda ukukhuluma.

But my father did just that.	Kodwa ubaba wami wakwenza lokho.
Just a lot of questions.	Imibuzo eminingi nje.
And, it should be easy, too.	Futhi, kufanele kube lula, futhi.
My mother works in a hospital.	Umama usebenza esibhedlela.
And that doesn't mean much.	Futhi lokho akusho okuningi.

This is the place, he thought.	Lena indawo, wacabanga.

Indeed, rather.	Ngempela, kunalokho.

Most of the time .	Isikhathi esiningi .
Such a beautiful view.	Umbono omuhle kangaka.
He, he.	Yena, yena .

You like something like that.	Uthanda into enjalo.
He soon died.	Ngokushesha washona.
You look wrong.	Ubukeka engalungile.
I can't eat anything right now.	Angikwazi ukudla lutho njengamanje.
I will not mention his name, not here.	Ngeke ngikhulume igama lakhe, hhayi lapha.
Today is just hard.	Namuhla kunzima nje.
What do you want me to do?	Ufuna ngenzeni .
But you will not get better.	Kodwa ngeke ube ngcono.

I did not see how that could happen.	Angizange ngibone ukuthi kungenzeka kanjani lokho.
Early in the morning, actually.	Ekuseni ekuseni, empeleni.
And it better be fast.	Futhi kungcono kube ngokushesha.
Finding a house.	Ukuthola indlu.
I've been thinking a lot.	Kade ngicabanga kakhulu.
It's just hard to get rid of him.	Kunzima nje ukuqeda ngaye.
Maybe something bad happened at home.	Mhlawumbe kukhona okubi okwenzekile ekhaya.
At least a few times a month.	Okungenani izikhathi ezimbalwa ngenyanga.
I thought you did well.	Bengicabanga ukuthi wenze kahle.
But it has to be here somewhere.	Kodwa kufanele kube lapha ndawo ndawo.
You live alone.	Uhlale wedwa.
He wanted something from her.	Wayefuna okuthile kuye.
You are obviously wrong.	Kusobala ukuthi unephutha.
I know it should be easy.	Ngiyazi ukuthi kufanele kube lula.
You do not have to go with me.	Akudingekile ukuba uhambe nami.
She pretends to be married to him.	Wenza sengathi umshado naye.

It is not your risk.	Akuyona ingozi yakho.
Whenever you can.	Noma nini lapho ungakwazi.
I hear crying.	Ngizwa ukukhala.

Hopefully, that is obvious.	Ngethemba, lokho kusobala.

That's one.	Eyodwa leyo.
And stay with him in the house.	Futhi uhlale naye endlini.
He hopes so.	Uthemba kanjalo.
Everywhere but nowhere.	Yonke indawo kodwa akukho ndawo.
All of this happened instantly to you.	Konke lokhu kwenzeke ngokushesha kuwe.
He was not and would not do such a thing.	Wayengekho futhi wayengeke enze into enjalo.
We can't, you know.	Asikwazi, uyazi.
You have to leave right now.	Kuzomele uhambe njengamanje.
Too many clothes.	Izingubo eziningi kakhulu.
I don't know how I can do that.	Angikwazi ukuthi ngingakwenza kanjani lokho.
I did all the work.	Ngenze wonke umsebenzi.
I didn't want to think about that.	Ngangingafuni ukucabanga ngalokho.
He did not make much money.	Akazange enze imali eningi.
It is also possible that he did not do that.	Kungenzeka futhi ukuthi akazange akwenze lokho.
I can't believe he knew.	Angikholwa ukuthi wayazi.
So he never talked about her.	Ngakho akakaze akhulume ngaye.
We did not find.	Asizange sithole.
That's it if you want to.	Yilokho uma ufuna.
Consider this.	Ake ucabange lokhu.

You need to hear.	Udinga ukuzwa.
Because he wanted more.	Ngoba wayefuna okwengeziwe.
He says there is something you need to know.	Uthi kukhona okumele ukwazi.

Maybe no one is coming, he thought.	Mhlawumbe akekho ozayo, wacabanga.
Another really nice place.	Enye indawo enhle ngempela.
Not because he doesn't want to.	Hhayi ngoba engafuni.

No, that will not be necessary.	Cha, lokho ngeke kudingeke.
Very good health.	Impilo enhle kakhulu.
Please, tell me something.	Ngicela, ungitshele okuthile.

Nothing is done outside today.	Akukho okwenziwa ngaphandle namuhla.
I hope you will be able to help.	Ngethemba ukuthi uzokwazi ukusiza.
I would like to know why.	Ngingathanda ukwazi ukuthi kungani lokhu.

And he was not in the house.	Futhi wayengekho endlini.

Another question for you.	Omunye umbuzo kuwe.
He decided to do what he could to help.	Wanquma ukwenza okusemandleni akhe ukuze asize.
This is not the way to do it.	Lena akuyona indlela yokwenza.
He said his name.	Wathi igama lakhe.
He can do it all.	Angakwenza konke.
Except my mom is gone.	Ngaphandle kokuthi umama wami akekho.

At night he cannot sleep.	Ebusuku akakwazi ukulala.
Maybe you want to be yourself.	Mhlawumbe ufuna ukuba nguwe.

But you have to do more to get there.	Kodwa kufanele wenze okuningi ukuze ufike lapho.
I don't know if it will happen.	Angazi noma kuzokwenzeka.
My mother told me in the car coming home.	Umama wangitshela emotweni efika ekhaya.
This here is not.	Lokhu lapha akukhona.
Not much, but little.	Hhayi okuningi, kodwa kancane.
I know it's okay.	Ngiyazi ukuthi kulungile.
He is only willing.	Uzimisele kuphela.
Family, not so much.	Umndeni, hhayi kakhulu.
No, not just a word.	Cha, hhayi izwi nje.
No, he was not sure when.	Cha, wayengenaso isiqiniseko sokuthi nini.
And he was afraid of the place.	Futhi wayesaba indawo.
Well, he thought.	Kahle, wacabanga.
I would like to think you are happy, thank you very much.	Ngingathanda ukucabanga ukuthi ujabule, ngiyabonga kakhulu.
Doing so is not our responsibility.	Ukwenza kanjalo akuwona umsebenzi wethu.

Or sometimes books.	Noma ngezinye izikhathi izincwadi.
But he could not be alone.	Kodwa wayengeke abe yedwa.
A week from now.	Isonto kusukela manje.

Not to give up.	Hhayi ukuyeka.
Even later.	Ngisho kamuva.

I feel good about this.	Ngizizwa kahle ngalokhu.
But his eyes mean something else.	Kodwa amehlo akhe asho okunye.
Small answer.	Impendulo encane.
I'm not sure what you mean here.	Angiqiniseki ukuthi usho ukuthini lapha.

He told me this story.	Wangitshela le ndaba.
Not much better, but better.	Hhayi kangcono kakhulu, kodwa kangcono.

Or it is true.	Noma kuyiqiniso.
I think it's a mistake.	Ngicabanga iphutha.

Whether this can be so or not does not matter.	Ukuthi lokhu kungaba njalo noma cha akusho lutho.
Still, that is his job.	Noma kunjalo, umsebenzi wakhe lowo.
I want to think about this.	Ngifuna ukucabanga ngalokhu.
Everyone went there.	Wonke umuntu waya lapho.
Everyone wants a picture.	Wonke umuntu ufuna isithombe.
That's from today.	Lokho kusukela namuhla.
He went there when he was young many times.	Waya lapho esemncane izikhathi eziningi.
Yes you can and it can be fast.	Yebo ungakwazi futhi kungaba ngokushesha.
He did all that.	Wenze konke lokho.
He feels very bad.	Uzizwa kabi kakhulu.
That's just what driving a car means.	Yilokho nje okushiwo ukushayela imoto.
The work has been really good.	Umsebenzi ube muhle ngempela.
Not just your house.	Hhayi nje indlu yakho.
You will not go to school tomorrow.	Ngeke uye esikoleni kusasa.
Well, there is no way we should do this at this time.	Kulungile, ayikho indlela okufanele sikwenze ngayo lokhu ngalesi sikhathi.
This is just the way it is.	Lokhu kunjalo nje.
He remained stunned.	Wahlala emangele.
Too long.	Isikhathi eside kakhulu .
Stop the worst ride yet.	Yeka ukugibela okubi kakhulu kuze kube manje.
It may be better, but it is not necessary.	Kungaba ngcono, kodwa akudingekile.
You have to stay optimistic.	Kufanele uhlale unethemba.

You should expect almost.	Kufanele ulindele cishe.
I'm sorry but it 's true.	Ngiyaxolisa kodwa kuyiqiniso.
I don't really have a good answer.	Anginayo ngempela impendulo enhle.
He arrived in the morning.	Ufike ekuseni.
There is no one at home.	Akukho muntu ekhaya.
He can do that but not much else.	Angakwenza lokho kodwa hhayi okunye okuningi.
He would always be with me.	Wayezoba nami njalo.

His spirit is so.	Umoya wakhe kunjalo.
So, they say.	Ngakho, bathi.
That never happened.	Akuzange kube khona lokho.
It is difficult to say why this is so.	Kunzima ukusho ukuthi kungani lokhu kunjalo.
We always know.	Siyazi njalo.
It should never be about him, alone.	Akufanele neze kube ngaye, yena kuphela.
He did not think to leave.	Wayengacabangi ukuthi ahambe.
But, really, it is not.	Kodwa, empeleni, akunjalo.
He has always wanted me to stay with him.	Ubelokhu efuna ngihlale naye khona.

I heard a noise again.	Ngizwe umsindo futhi.
It had to be a big deal.	Kwakufanele kube yinto enkulu.
So much for everything.	Kuningi kakhulu kukho konke.
But he said it was better than that.	Kodwa wathi kungcono kunalokho.

He didn't want to be here anyway.	Wayengafuni ukuba lapha noma kunjalo.
Sometimes nothing at all for days.	Ngezinye izikhathi akukho lutho nhlobo izinsuku.
Sometimes we can't.	Ngezinye izikhathi asikwazi.
His shoes.	Izicathulo zakhe.
You have to do what he did !.	Kufanele wenze lokhu akwenzile!.
You probably found it much easier.	Mhlawumbe uthole okuningi kalula kakhulu.
You need to be able to see that.	Kumele ukwazi ukukubona lokho.
And no one, of course.	Futhi akekho, kunjalo.
But something else is likely to happen.	Kodwa kungase kwenzeke okunye futhi.
So stop crying.	Ngakho yeka ukukhala.
My constant hope.	Ithemba lami njalo.
He can't go there.	Angeke aye lapho.
Have you ever thought of something.	Uke wacabanga okuthile.
It will take your breath away.	Kuzothatha umoya wakho.
They will not say no.	Ngeke bathi cha.
But it's really hard to see.	Kodwa kunzima ngempela ukubona.
There is no money here.	Ayikho imali lapha.

Good news there.	Indaba enhle lapho.
Her mother just wouldn't do that.	Umama wakhe ubengeke nje akwenze lokho.
That will be difficult.	Lokho kuzoba nzima.
All of that will happen soon.	Konke lokho kuzokwenzeka maduze nje.
I don't want to talk about that.	Angifuni ukukhuluma ngalokho.
He wanted her to talk.	Wayefuna ukuthi akhulume.

At first, he thought nothing of it.	Ekuqaleni, wayengacabangi lutho ngakho.
In fact, that is true.	Empeleni lokho kuyiqiniso.
he asked again.	wabuza futhi.
Any car.	Noma iyiphi imoto.
So, they say, it's okay.	Ngakho, bathi, kulungile.
Great in the world.	Okukhulu emhlabeni.
In a new place, not so much.	Endaweni entsha, hhayi kakhulu.
I know a lot.	Ngazi okuningi .
But this time a big mistake happened.	Kodwa ngalesi sikhathi kwenzeka iphutha elikhulu.
I've thought about this myself.	Ngike ngacabanga ngalokhu mina.
But he arrived too late.	Kodwa ufike sekwephuzile kakhulu.
Just to keep going.	Ukuqhubeka nje.
Maybe you're telling the truth.	Mhlawumbe ukhuluma iqiniso.
I probably never left.	Kungenzeka angikaze ngihambe.
One such place.	Enye indawo enjalo.
You can do nothing about it.	Awukwazi ukwenza lutho kukho.
It is often difficult for me.	Uvame ukuba nzima kimi.
Convincing my parents would be easier.	Ukukholisa abazali bami kungaba lula.
Hope to choose one.	Ithemba ukukhetha eyodwa.
He really wanted to die.	Impela wayefuna ukufa.
But still.	Kodwa noma kunjalo .
Too much thinking.	Ukucabanga okuningi kakhulu.
It just sounds good.	Kuzwakala kahle nje.
However, that is not here and it is not there.	Noma kunjalo, lokho akukho lapha futhi akukho lapho.
Not a problem.	Akunjalo inkinga.
I do not know but still.	Angazi kodwa namanje.
It might actually be the best place for him.	Empeleni kungase kube indawo engcono kakhulu kuye.
You do not need to stay here.	Awudingi ukuhlala lapha.
And once.	Futhi kanye.
He should not have been here, until tomorrow.	Bekungafanele abe lapha, kuze kube kusasa.
You are in prison.	Wena ejele.
I can't help that.	Angikwazi ukusiza ngalokho.
To this day, no one knows what happened.	Kuze kube namuhla, akekho owaziyo ukuthi kwenzekani.
We should have known then.	Bekufanele ngabe siyazi ngaleso sikhathi.
He does not think at all.	Akacabangi nakancane izinto.
Everything is true, everything is absolutely true.	Konke kuyiqiniso, konke kuyiqiniso ngokuphelele.
Everyone can't get there.	Wonke umuntu akakwazi ukuza lapho.
All too much.	Konke kakhulu.
There is no such danger here.	Lapha ayikho ingozi enjalo.
It should have been last week.	Bekumele kube ngesonto eledlule.
No, not just crying.	Cha, hhayi nje ukukhala.
I have to go alone.	Kufanele ngihambe ngedwa.
And she saw the baby.	Futhi wabona ingane.
And we have to do that.	Futhi kufanele sikwenze lokho.
But this is better.	Kodwa lokhu kungcono.
But in this case, he is, in fact, telling the truth.	Kodwa kulokhu, okungenani, ukhuluma iqiniso.
That's right, I really do, you know.	Kunjalo, ukwenza kwami ​​ngempela, uyazi.
Still, he was surprised.	Noma kunjalo, wamangala.
You can't take your time.	Awukwazi ukuthatha isikhathi sakho.
But nowhere right now.	Kodwa akukho ndawo okwamanje.
Maybe he wasn't here at the time.	Mhlawumbe wayengekho lapha ngaleso sikhathi.
This is no trivial matter.	Lena akuyona indaba encane.
But still, he felt better.	Kodwa noma kunjalo, wazizwa engcono.
I can no longer think of this evening.	Angisakwazi ukucabanga ngalokhu kusihlwa.
You look like that.	Ubukeka sengathi.
But sometimes you don't really need it.	Kodwa ngezinye izikhathi awudingi ngempela.
Still the police.	Namanje amaphoyisa.
That he is not even human.	Ukuthi akayena ngisho umuntu.
The problem is to see who it is.	Inkinga ukubona ukuthi ubani.
And not next week, or next year.	Futhi hhayi ngesonto elizayo, noma ngonyaka ozayo.
Of course no one knows about that yet.	Yebo akekho owaziyo ngalokho okwamanje.
You would not know it all.	Ubungeke ukwazi konke.
Certainly an idea.	Impela umqondo.
But it can easily happen.	Kodwa kungenzeka kalula.
Little by little about that.	Kancane kancane ngalokho.
I've been all my life.	Ngihambe impilo yami yonke.
And maybe true.	Futhi mhlawumbe iqiniso.
I wish it was all that easy.	Ngifisa sengathi ngabe konke kube lula kangako.
Also, I'm sorry about that.	Futhi, ngiyaxolisa ngalokho.
If anything, you are doing something right.	Uma kukhona, wenza okuthile kahle.
We need to find the truth about this.	Kufanele sithole iqiniso ngalokhu.
Still happy about it.	Noma kunjalo ujabule ngakho.
He didn't want her to leave yet.	Wayengafuni ukuthi ahambe okwamanje.
Here, that is not the story.	Lapha, leyo akuyona indaba.
I would love to see you then.	Ngingathanda ukukubona ngaleso sikhathi.
And there are problems right now.	Futhi kukhona izinkinga okwamanje.
I want a little '.	Ngifuna kancane'.
I heard my father talking about you.	Ngizwe ubaba ekhuluma ngawe.
I wish you were here next to me.	Ngifisa sengathi ngabe ulapha eduze kwami.
He has to get to it.	Kumele afike kukho.
He would not do that to me.	Wayengeke akwenze lokho kimi.
Okay bike.	Kulungile ibhayisikili.
So he finally had to leave.	Ngakho ekugcineni kwadingeka ahambe.
He did not stay with me for a day.	Akazange ahlale usuku nami.
And the question is who and why.	Futhi umbuzo uthi ubani futhi ngani.
That's a lot, really.	Kuningi lokho, impela.
Are you there.	Ngabe ukhona.
I want to talk too.	Nami ngifuna ukukhuluma.
Ultimately everyone has to do their job.	Ekugcineni wonke umuntu kufanele enze umsebenzi wakhe.
He did it then, he can do it again.	Wakwenza ngaleso sikhathi, angakwenza futhi.
Seeing as it should be.	Ukubona ngendlela okufanele kube ngayo.
I am very confident in myself.	Ngiyaqiniseka kakhulu ngami.
I've heard of him before.	Ngike ngizwe ngaye ngaphambilini.
Her mother told the doctor she knew.	Umama wakhe watshela udokotela ukuthi uyazi.
More, if any.	Okuningi, uma kukhona.
I could not do it alone.	Angikwazanga ukukwenza ngedwa.
But he spoke easily and clearly.	Kodwa wakhuluma kalula futhi kahle.
You did it really well.	Ukwenze kahle impela.
And you did it just once in the end.	Futhi ukwenze kanye nje ekugcineni.
But now it is very good.	Kodwa manje kuhle kakhulu.
Especially at night.	Kakhulu ebusuku.
Because not everyone will do that.	Ngoba wonke umuntu ngeke akwenze lokho.
Certainly a city.	Impela umuzi.
He should not do it, either.	Akufanele akwenze, futhi.
I could not think, only to hear.	Angikwazanga ukucabanga, ukuzwa kuphela.
Very good but he has to go now.	Kuhle kakhulu kodwa kumele ahambe manje.
Very good, of course.	Kuhle kakhulu, kunjalo.
I think that sounds hard.	Ngicabanga ukuthi lokho kuzwakala kunzima.
He will stay at school.	Uzohlala esikoleni.
That you will get better.	Ukuthi uzoba ngcono.
But thinking enough.	Kodwa ukucabanga ngokwanele.
I know why and how.	Ngiyazi ukuthi kungani futhi kanjani.
And maybe not you.	Futhi mhlawumbe hhayi nawe.
How does it sound ?.	Kuzwakala kanjani?.
We found a gun here.	Sithole isibhamu lapha.
I know you think you can't.	Ngiyazi ucabanga ukuthi awukwazi.
No need .	Asikho isidingo .
He asked three questions.	Wabuza imibuzo emithathu.
You can stop.	Ungakwazi ukuyeka.
Nice to see you tonight.	Ngijabule ukukubona kusihlwa.
Thank you for wanting to help.	Ngiyabonga ngokuthi ufuna ukusiza.
It's just hard to see.	Kunzima nje ukubona.
Or even months.	Noma ngisho izinyanga.
He would never want anything again.	Wayengeke aphinde afune lutho.
But here it is difficult.	Kodwa lapha kunzima.
I really don’t want to do that again.	Angifuni ngempela ukwenza lokho futhi.
I can't wait for this.	Angikwazi ukulinda lokhu.
This is also true.	Lokhu kuyiqiniso futhi.
I want him to try his best.	Ngifuna azame konke okusemandleni akhe.
I did not go to him.	Angizange ngiye kuye.
You know this is going to be a big job.	Uyazi ukuthi lokhu kuzoba umsebenzi omkhulu.
I need to think, alone.	Ngidinga ukucabanga, ngedwa.
Many have improved.	Abaningi kube ngcono.
Only shoes.	Izicathulo kuphela.
He will be back in the evening.	Uzobuya kusihlwa.
Or maybe you did not.	Noma mhlawumbe awuzange.
True again.	Iqiniso futhi.
Australia does not exist.	I-Australia ayikho.
How would you know.	Ubungazi kanjani.
He wants to help you.	Ufisa ukukusiza.
I never thought I would see such a thing.	Angikaze ngicabange ukubona into enjalo.
And that's a lot.	Futhi lokho kuningi.
I want to stay close.	Ngifuna ukuhlala eduze.
Eating food.	Ukudla ukudla.
I doubt this is always true.	Ngiyangabaza ukuthi lokhu kuyiqiniso njalo.
It all starts right here.	Konke kuqala khona lapha.
He tried to sleep without her.	Wazama ukulala ngaphandle kwakhe.
Tell me what happened to you.	Ngitshele ukuthi kwenzekani kuwe.
She is beautiful in the right way.	Muhle ngendlela efanele.
I need to be alone to think.	Ngidinga ukuba ngedwa ukuze ngicabange.
It must be very difficult.	Kumele kube nzima kakhulu.
He doesn't want it now.	Akafuni manje.
Sounds good though.	Kubonakala kulungile kodwa.
I couldn’t find everything.	Angikwazanga ukuthola yonke into.
This, of course, is possible.	Lokhu, ngempela, kungenzeka.
He thinks about that for a moment.	Ucabanga ngalokho isikhashana.
He often ate early.	Wayevame ukudla kusenesikhathi.
It could be years, it could be anything.	Kungaba iminyaka, kungaba noma yini.
And a lot of bad, too.	Futhi okuningi okubi, futhi.
He will never and never will.	Akasoze enze njalo futhi ngeke.
He will go with me now.	Uzohamba nami manje.
When you know you know.	Lapho uyazi uyazi.
So you work long hours just to make ends meet.	Ngakho usebenza amahora amaningi ukuze uthole imali encane.
I didn’t want to do that right now.	Ngangingafuni ukwenza lokho njengamanje.
Let's go this way.	Ake sihambe ngale ndlela.
He said it was a bad place.	Wathi indawo embi.
Some meeting is required.	Kudingeka umhlangano othile.
The boy looked happy.	Umfana wayebonakala ejabule.
Seeing this all the time.	Ukubona lokhu ngaso sonke isikhathi.
It should be hard for him.	Kumele kube nzima kuye.
He wanted to, of course.	Wayefuna, kunjalo.
There is a problem coming up.	Kukhona inkinga ezayo.
I'm glad it was.	Ngiyajabula ukuthi kube njalo.
But no, you want me to do it.	Kodwa cha, ufuna ngikwenze.
It is actually very difficult.	Empeleni kunzima kakhulu.
He is trying very hard.	Uzama kakhulu.
That is simply not true.	Lokho akulona nje iqiniso.
I should not be up here.	Akufanele ngabe ngilapha phezulu.
Dad can't walk.	Ubaba akakwazi ukuhamba.
I never saw what it could be.	Angikaze ngibone ukuthi kungaba yini.
He wanted to eat.	Wayefuna ukudla.
He walked slowly not wanting to sit down.	Ahambe kancane engafuni ukuhlala phansi.
You do not need anyone to do that.	Awudingi muntu ukwenza lokho.
The worst way.	Indlela embi kakhulu.
Right here in the city.	Khona lapha edolobheni.
I am here every day.	Ngilapha nsuku zonke.
In the summer, it may be a problem.	Ehlobo, kungase kube inkinga.
Not a good place for him.	Akuyona indawo enhle kuye.
Once a month, my mother says.	Kanye ngenyanga, umama uthi.
Maybe not even true.	Mhlawumbe akulona ngisho iqiniso.
Unless it seems like nothing at all.	Ngaphandle uma kubonakala sengathi akukho konke.
I asked to know.	Ngacela ukwazi.
I mean, you have to be yourself.	Ngisho, kufanele ube nguwe.
It would be the first time in our city.	Kungaba okokuqala edolobheni lethu.
He could not make himself think that way.	Akakwazanga ukuzenza acabange kanjalo.
And if you said yes.	Futhi uma uthe yebo.
She is here in bed.	Ulapha embhedeni.
I really wish for more now.	Ngifisa ngempela okunye manje.
He could not choose a gun.	Akakwazanga ukukhetha isibhamu.
He came to me for help.	Weza kimi efuna usizo.
I went to his house last night.	Ngiye endlini yakhe izolo ebusuku.
And much for the first time.	Futhi okuningi okokuqala.
He wanted to drive more.	Wayefuna ukushayela okwengeziwe.
Not bad, at all.	Hhayi kabi, nhlobo.
He did that for you.	Wakwenza lokho kuwe.
It just sounds like another voice.	Kuzwakala elinye izwi nje.
You know, you can't do anything about it.	Uyazi, awukwazi ukwenza lutho ngakho.
He wanted to be a doctor.	Wayefuna ukuba udokotela.
Shirt.	Ihembe .
If you want this, fine.	Uma ufuna lokhu, kulungile.
That could be me, easily.	Lokho kungaba yimi, kalula.
You cannot be a father in the office.	Awukwazi ukuba ubaba ehhovisi.
He knew about that, too, he thought.	Wayazi ngalokho, naye, wacabanga.
Or at least, it is possible.	Noma okungenani, kungenzeka.
I don't want it to be that way.	Angifuni kube njalo.
He also wants to get in the car.	Naye ufuna ukungena emotweni.
Not without it anyway.	Hhayi ngaphandle noma kunjalo.
So, there are a few problems.	Ngakho, kukhona izinkinga ezimbalwa.
Not to be better.	Hhayi ukuba ngcono.
We are looking for work every day.	Sifuna umsebenzi nsuku zonke.
He saw his thinking.	Wabona ukucabanga kwakhe.
But as it is.	Kodwa njengoba kunjalo.
But he stayed for a long time.	Kodwa wahlala isikhathi eside.
He thought that maybe he would be a father.	Wayecabanga ukuthi mhlawumbe uzoba ubaba.
My son probably knows.	Kungenzeka ukuthi indodana yami uyazi.
He did this before, obviously.	Wakwenza lokhu ngaphambili ngokusobala.
He would like to know my opinion.	Angathanda ukwazi umbono wami.
Very nice dog.	Inja enhle kakhulu.
All this he thought was good, but very difficult.	Konke lokhu wayecabanga ukuthi kuhle, kodwa kunzima kakhulu.
She is happy and very happy.	Ujabule futhi ujabule kakhulu.
Feeling very happy, she left.	Wazizwa ejabule kakhulu, wahamba.
He wasn't even a real friend.	Wayengeyena ngisho umngane ngempela.
It's late for school.	Sekwephuzile esikoleni.
Everyone knows that, of course.	Wonke umuntu uyakwazi lokho, impela.
I want to go on my own time.	Ngifuna ukuhamba ngesikhathi sami.
So stop playing with me.	Ngakho yeka ukudlala ngami.
Great job !.	Muhle kakhulu umsebenzi!.
He will not go alone.	Angeke ahambe yedwa.
You really did.	Ngempela wenze.
You know about it.	Uyazi ngakho.
Maybe not even that long.	Mhlawumbe hhayi ngisho isikhathi eside kangako.
He didn't want to think.	Wayengafuni ukucabanga.
I knew about him.	Ngangazi ngaye.
You should have told me this before.	Bekumele ungitshele lokhu ngaphambilini.
I am the problem there.	Yimi inkinga lapho.
He wanted her to go home.	Wayefuna ukuthi aye ekhaya.
Or at least, not recently.	Noma okungenani, hhayi kamuva nje.
In this case, he knew nothing.	Kulokhu, wayengazi lutho.
More energy is needed.	Kudingeka amandla amaningi.
And he wants to.	Futhi ufuna.
I have never been so scared.	Angikaze ngesaba kangaka.
Not just about him.	Hhayi nje ngaye.
You know what happened last night.	Uyazi ukuthi kwenzekeni izolo ebusuku.
Yes, it would be great.	Yebo, kungaba kuhle kakhulu.
The only problem is that we can't create an image yet.	Inkinga kuphela ukuthi asikwazi ukwenza isithombe okwamanje.
He locked his door.	Ukhiye umnyango wakhe.
This time, it should be good.	Lesi sikhathi, kufanele kube kuhle.
I think we should do that.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kufanele sikwenze lokho.
This is no trivial matter.	Akuyona indaba encane lena.
That's a good idea again.	Lowo umbono omuhle kabusha.
She is easily scared.	Uyesaba kalula nje.
I'd like to try that.	Ngingathanda ukuzama lokho.
Not just at this time.	Hhayi nje ngalesi sikhathi.
Stop eating.	Yeka ukudla.
I just wanted to hear his voice.	Ngangifuna ukuzwa izwi lakhe kuphela.
He probably should not have been there at all.	Cishe kwakungafanele nhlobo abe lapho.
It can be, without a.	Kungaba, ngaphandle cha.
But a good friend.	Kodwa umngane omuhle.
I never knew anything else.	Angikaze ngazi enye into.
Not just here, no, all over the world.	Hhayi nje lapha, cha, emhlabeni wonke.
For better money.	Ukuze uthole imali engcono.
But not this one, of course.	Kodwa hhayi lena, kunjalo.
I'm so sorry to hear about it.	Ngiyaxolisa kakhulu ukuzwa ngakho.
So he would not know.	Ngakho wayengeke azi.
He does not love anyone but himself.	Akathandi muntu ngaphandle kwakhe.
Obviously there is nothing there.	Ngokusobala akukho lutho lapho.
No hard work.	Akukho ukusebenza kanzima.
My life.	Impilo yami .
He knows any of us can do that.	Uyazi noma ubani kithi angakwenza lokho.
You will know this.	Uzokwazi lokhu.
And another week.	Futhi elinye isonto.
As long as it can be.	Uma nje kungaba njalo.
This is not just my opinion.	Lokhu akuwona nje umbono wami.
You work your way up to get to it.	Usebenza ngendlela yakho ukuze ufike kukho.
He did not want to be here again.	Wayengafuni ukuba lapha futhi.
I could not quit so easily.	Angikwazanga ukuyeka kalula kanjalo.
She wants to cry.	Ufuna ukukhala.
But it will not be him.	Kodwa ngeke kube nguye.
It has been a long time since you knew that.	Sekuyisikhathi eside ukwazi lokho.
It doesn't have to be a day.	Akudingekile ukuba kube usuku.
Here, he just works all the time.	Lapha, usebenza nje ngaso sonke isikhathi.
Both in the afternoon.	Bobabili ntambama.
This obviously happens a lot.	Lokhu ngokusobala kwenzeka kakhulu.
I should not stay.	Akufanele ngihlale.
Maybe even better.	Mhlawumbe ngisho kahle kakhulu.
And not even good.	Futhi hhayi ngisho omuhle.
He just needs to play with you.	Udinga nje ukudlala nawe.
This is true, but it is not the only truth.	Lokhu kuyiqiniso, kodwa akulona iqiniso lelo kuphela.
That might be helpful in this regard.	Lokho kungase kube usizo kulokhu.
But you will not be alone.	Kodwa ngeke ube wedwa.
I don’t think it should be so hard.	Angicabangi ukuthi kufanele kube nzima kanje.
Just playful, but still.	Ukudlala nje, kodwa noma kunjalo.
Apparently he did not.	Ngokusobala akazange akwenze lokho.
I did that last week.	Ngikwenze lokho ngesonto eledlule.
I wanted him to know everything.	Bengifuna akwazi konke.
There is so much to learn at one time or another.	Kuningi ngempela ukufunda ngesikhathi esisodwa.
Probably a bad decision.	Mhlawumbe isinqumo esibi.
But he did not want to talk.	Kodwa wayengafuni ukukhuluma.
He just looked quickly.	Wabheka nje ngokushesha.
I didn’t want to see much about it.	Ngangingafuni ukubona okuningi ngakho.
I don’t know too much about it.	Angazi okuningi kakhulu ngakho.
Not a good job.	Akuwona umsebenzi omuhle.
He never arrived on time.	Akazange neze afike ngesikhathi.
I hear his voice clearly.	Ngizwa izwi lakhe ngokusobala.
So there has to be something there really.	Ngakho kufanele kube khona okuthile lapho ngempela.
And it is probably not true.	Futhi cishe akulona iqiniso.
That happens enough at work.	Lokho kwenzeka ngokwanele emsebenzini.
What a bad thing to get home.	Yeka into embi ukufika ekhaya.
Or unless you are beautiful.	Noma ngaphandle kokuthi muhle.
So you have time.	Ngakho unesikhathi.
And what a wonderful idea.	Futhi yeka umbono omuhle.
I need to rethink this.	Ngidinga ukucabanga kabusha ngalokhu.
Not in that.	Hhayi kulokho.
Now that would be great !.	Manje lokho kungaba kuhle!.
You need to know this about me.	Udinga ukwazi lokhu ngami.
I made a new person.	Ngenze umuntu omusha.
My mother would not be able to live without her.	Umama ubengeke akwazi ukuphila ngaphandle kwakhe.
Money, yes.	Imali, yebo.
And it's very good too.	Futhi kuhle kakhulu futhi.
I can not know.	Angikwazi ukwazi.
You know that's right.	Uyazi ukuthi lokho kulungile.
I don't want to, either.	Angifuni, futhi.
So it should be tomorrow.	Ngakho kufanele kube kusasa.
And in the right way.	Futhi ngendlela efanele.
He would, in fact.	Angathanda, empeleni.
But perhaps that is not the case.	Kodwa mhlawumbe akunjalo ngempela.
It seems to me for a very long time.	Kubonakala kimi isikhathi eside kakhulu.
Mom is obviously asleep today.	Umama kusobala namuhla ulele.
We certainly did here.	Impela senze lapha.
He got into this.	Wangena kulokhu.
It was hard to find someone.	Kube nzima ukuthola umuntu.
I thought so too.	Bengicabanga kanjalo nami.
I thought that.	Ngacabanga lokho.
The first is simple.	Okokuqala kube lula.
You need to know what's going on.	Udinga ukwazi ukuthi kwenzekani.
You should also not do it.	Akufanele futhi ukwenze.
He arrived here this morning.	Ufike lapha ekuseni.
I have to think so.	Kufanele ngicabange kanjalo.
Other things, not so much.	Ezinye izinto, hhayi kakhulu.
You do not even have to read the whole story.	Asikho isidingo ngisho ukufunda yonke indaba.
He told me, too.	Wangitshela, futhi.
Here, the problem is me.	Lapha, inkinga yimi.
He would love to hear from you.	Angathanda ukuzwa kuwe.
I asked how that was possible.	Ngabuza ukuthi kungenzeka kanjani lokho.
Yeah, that's probably the best.	Yebo, lokho mhlawumbe kungcono kakhulu.
He or she.	Yena noma yena.
Some days almost no one.	Ngezinye izinsuku cishe akekho.
So much in prison.	Kakhulu ejele.
No, another thing.	Cha, enye into.
Indeed, every day.	Ngempela, nsuku zonke.
He has never spoken of this place.	Akakaze akhulume ngale ndawo.
But there is not much to do about it.	Kodwa akukho okuningi okumele kwenziwe ngakho.
That's it, for now though.	Yilokho ngakho, okwamanje noma kunjalo.
I was thinking.	Bengicabanga .
She started singing with him.	Waqala ukucula kanye naye.
Does anyone know ?.	Ukhona owaziyo?.
He said the book.	Wathi incwadi.
He saw my father there.	Wabona ubaba lapho.
This, and this, but not this.	Lokhu, nalokhu, kodwa hhayi lokhu.
He finally agreed and opened the door.	Ekugcineni wavuma wavula umnyango.
He walks slowly to the restaurant.	Uhamba kancane eya endlini yokudlela.
I'm not even sure why.	Angiqiniseki nokuthi kungani.
I talk a lot with him.	Ngikhuluma kakhulu naye.
That is not just a story.	Akuyona nje indaba leyo.
Bad news.	Indaba embi.
Or my family.	Noma umndeni wami.
We do it every day.	Senza nsuku zonke.
I can't say how often.	Angikwazi ukusho ukuthi kaningi kangakanani.
Yes, every day.	Yebo, nsuku zonke.
He promised to do so and took the money.	Wathembisa ukwenza njalo wathatha imali.
We'd better find out.	Kungcono sithole.
I want to talk about us.	Ngifuna ukukhuluma ngathi.
It's all just right.	Konke kunjalo nje.
And she eats well.	Futhi udla kahle.
Not even true.	Akulona ngisho iqiniso.
He said he was going to a meeting.	Wathi uya emhlanganweni.
He thought he was talented.	Wayecabanga ukuthi unekhono.
Everyone just walked away.	Wonke umuntu wavele wahamba.
He walked away and walked away.	Wahamba wahamba wahamba.
No decision yet.	Asikho isinqumo okwamanje.
He had a bad time.	Waba nesikhathi esibi.
In the end, it has to happen.	Ekugcineni, kufanele kwenzeke.
I have never been anywhere.	Angikaze ngiye ndawo.
He told me who he was.	Wangitshela ukuthi ubani.
And, it's been a long time.	Futhi, sekunesikhathi eside.
Now let me say this.	Manje ake ngisho lokhu.
I must say nothing in all of this.	Akumele ngisho lutho kukho konke lokhu.
That is not to say that he was not present.	Lokho akusho ukuthi wayengekho.
He looked around the room.	Wabuka igumbi lonke.
He said it would be a job.	Wathi kuzoba umsebenzi.
I think we know how that happened.	Ngicabanga ukuthi siyazi ukuthi lokho kwenzeka kanjani.
He was afraid he would never come back.	Wayesaba ukuthi ngeke abuye.
It's hard at this point.	Kunzima ngalesi sikhathi.
I was thinking that right away.	Ngangicabanga lokho ngaso leso sikhathi.
At least, everyone did.	Okungenani, wonke umuntu wenza kanjalo.
Okay, not really, but almost.	Kulungile, hhayi ngempela, kodwa cishe.
He can be very persuasive when he wants to.	Angakwazi ukukholisa kakhulu lapho efuna.
John does not think so either.	UJohn naye akacabangi kanjalo.
I wanted meat.	Ngangifuna inyama.
He got into a lot of trouble.	Wangena enkingeni enkulu.
Your car, a mistake.	Imoto yakho, iphutha .
He has to tell someone.	Kumele atshele othile.
Alone on the ground.	Eyedwa phansi.
She is my teacher.	Unguthisha wami.
Okay, he'll be out of the house.	Kulungile, uzobe engekho endlini.
Nothing in college.	Akukho lutho ekolishi.
If so the performance may be good.	Uma kunjalo ukusebenza kungase kube kuhle.
You think .	Ucabanga kanjalo .
I've done it all my life.	Ngikwenze ukuphila kwakho konke.
But it works fast.	Kodwa usebenza ngokushesha.
Maybe he wanted a father.	Mhlawumbe wayefuna ubaba.
Even if he went with her.	Noma ngabe wahamba naye.
I still don't really like it.	Namanje angikuthandi ngempela.
He did not know that it would be so.	Wayengazi ukuthi kungaba njalo.
Not friends.	Hhayi abangani abangani.
What is the best way to do it.	Iyiphi indlela engcono kakhulu yokwenza.
Smoking a little.	Ukubhema kancane.
But he wanted more.	Kodwa wayefuna okunye.
This is not a story.	Lokhu akuyona indaba.
I'm so glad to have you now.	Ngijabule kakhulu ukuba nawe manje.
Tomorrow soon out.	Kusasa maduze nje.
I don't even remember what it was.	Angisakhumbuli nokuthi yini.
He says something about me.	Uthi okuthile ngami.
But not today, he decided.	Kodwa hhayi namuhla, wanquma.
To stop.	Ukuyeka.
I found out a lot about it.	Ngithole ukwazi okuningi ngayo.
He asked me to leave.	Wangicela ukuthi ngihambe.
Also, his coat.	Futhi, ingubo yakhe.
The music is just as good.	Umculo muhle kanjalo nje.
I can do it with you if you like.	Ngingakwenza nawe uma uthanda.
No, he will not.	Cha, ngeke aye.
You will have a great time here.	Uzoba nesikhathi esihle kakhulu lapha.
She is very happy, too.	Ujabule kakhulu, futhi.
I don't want him to leave immediately though.	Angifuni ukuthi ahambe ngokushesha kodwa.
Not a bad thing, really.	Akuyona into embi, ngempela.
I really want a friend.	Ngempela ngifuna umngane.
Well, definitely.	Kuhle, nakanjani.
It's so early.	Ekuseni kangaka .
He did not know how long he would have to stay in the city.	Wayengazi ukuthi uzohlala isikhathi esingakanani edolobheni.
I think that's a big deal for him.	Ngicabanga ukuthi yinto enkulu kuye leyo.
These are children.	Lezi izingane.
He immediately asked me to do it again.	Ngokushesha wangicela ukuba ngikwenze futhi.
Not just him, but his family too.	Hhayi yena kuphela, kodwa nomndeni wakhe.
Not too early.	Hhayi ekuseni kakhulu.
If a bit.	Uma kancane.
Do you know?.	Ingabe uyazi?.
He could not work with her here.	Akakwazanga ukusebenza naye lapha.
Well done tonight.	Wenze kahle namhlanje ebusuku.
He wanted to ride some more.	Wayefuna ukugibela okunye.
Want to read ?.	Ufuna ukufunda?.
It could be a lot.	Kungase kube okuningi.
Today you received a message.	Namuhla uthole umlayezo.
Death now.	Ukufa manje.
I immediately told my friend.	Ngokushesha ngatshela umngane wami.
But one should not go too far.	Kodwa umuntu akufanele ahambe kakhulu.
Most of the time with you.	Isikhathi esiningi nawe.
We want that.	Sifuna lokho.
As he did so, he noticed something.	Njengoba enza kanjalo, waqaphela okuthile.
You have to be good at this.	Kufanele ube muhle kulokhu.
I am convinced that everyone has done their best.	Ngiyaqiniseka ukuthi wonke umuntu wenze konke okusemandleni akhe.
He really did a great downside.	Impela wenza phansi okukhulu.
I couldn't drive right now.	Angikwazanga ukushayela njengamanje.
There is something wrong with me.	Kukhona okubi ngami.
Please just go.	Ngicela uhambe nje.
Here, 'he says.	Lapha,' usho kanje.
He did not think of an answer.	Akazange acabange impendulo.
But he could not help but try again.	Kodwa akakwazanga ukuzibamba ezama futhi.
Nobody wants this to happen.	Akekho ofuna lokhu kwenzeke.
I wanted to find a new place.	Bengifuna ukuthola indawo entsha.
And we should not do it.	Futhi akufanele sikwenze.
Not me, at least.	Hhayi mina, okungenani.
It is difficult to do and very difficult to do well.	Kunzima ukuzenza futhi kunzima kakhulu ukwenza kahle.
Now think about it.	Manje ake ucabange ngakho.
He told me to do it.	Wathi ngikwenze.
Not too much and not too small.	Hhayi kakhulu futhi hhayi encane kakhulu.
I'm sure he feels the same way.	Ngiqinisekile naye uzizwa ngendlela efanayo.
And it should not be this way.	Futhi akufanele nje kube ngale ndlela.
Nothing great at the time.	Ayikho into enkulu ngaleso sikhathi.
I should have been better.	Bekufanele ngibe ngcono.
You can do it.	Ungakwenza .
That's why he came, of course.	Yingakho eze, kunjalo.
I need to come here, right now.	Ngidinga ukuza lapha, khona manje.
It's better to have him.	Kungcono ukuba naye.
Knowing what you mean.	Ukwazi ukuthi usho ukuthini.
The question was not that.	Umbuzo awuzange ube ukuthi.
It would be nice to see everyone.	Kungaba kuhle ukubona wonke umuntu.
There is nothing to be done about it.	Akukho okumele kwenziwe ngalokho.
If you can, please tell me.	Uma ukwazi, ngicela ungitshele.
I will not know now.	Ngeke ngazi manje.
And now we better go.	Futhi manje kungcono sihambe.

But that does not mean that it is.	Kodwa lokho akusho ukuthi kunjalo.
You, there.	Wena, lapho.
I want to be that.	Ngifuna ukuba yilokho.
He didn't know much more than that.	Wayengazi okuningi kunalokho.
He asked what he liked to talk about.	Wabuza ukuthi uthanda ukukhuluma ngani.
Everyone knows everyone or everyone knows it.	Wonke umuntu wazi wonke umuntu noma wazi wonke umuntu.
Or I say that there is no such thing.	Noma ngisho ukuthi ayikho into enjalo.
Big, big, big.	Enkulu, enkulu, enkulu.
There is no error.	Akukho iphutha.
I just want to know you're here.	Ngifuna ukwazi nje ukuthi ulapha.

You need to help us now.	Udinga ukusisiza manje.
I think it should have been me.	Ngicabanga ukuthi bekufanele kube yimina.
But help me anyway.	Kodwa ngisize noma kunjalo.
I would just like someone else.	Ngingathanda nje omunye umuntu.
You look the same way.	Ubukeka ngendlela efanayo.
I don't even have it here myself.	Anginayo ngisho nami lapha.
You can't be with us both.	Awukwazi ukuba nathi sobabili.
He was not all that person.	Wayengeyena wonke lowo muntu.
He was not a very nice person.	Wayengeyena umuntu omuhle kakhulu.
How do you know that.	Wazi kanjani lokho.
Not you, not me, not anyone.	Hhayi wena, hhayi mina, hhayi noma ubani.
Yes, there is a problem.	Yebo, kukhona inkinga.
Nice place, by the way.	Indawo enhle, ngendlela.
He will not be alone.	Ngeke abe yedwa.
You think you can't.	Ucabanga ukuthi ngeke.
Not the first.	Hhayi kuqala .
I knew nothing of that.	Ngangingazi lutho kulokho.

I got the key again.	Ngithole ukhiye futhi.
He would not be alone here.	Wayengeke ahlale yedwa lapha.
There are a few things.	Kukhona izinto ezimbalwa.
You do not need a problem.	Awudingi inkinga.
I hope this can be helpful.	Ngethemba ukuthi lokhu kungaba usizo.
He had no time.	Isikhathi wayengenaso.
He can't think.	Akakwazi ukucabanga.
But this is probably the case now.	Kodwa lokhu cishe kunjalo manje.
Marriage is only good if you keep it.	Umshado muhle kuphela uma uhlala.
Great place now.	Indawo enhle manje.
You just have to choose the right one.	Udinga nje ukukhetha enye indlela efanele.
Not that much.	Hhayi ukuthi kuningi.
I've heard it before.	Ngike ngezwa ngaphambili.
It happened.	Kwenzekeni .
He did this only with me.	Wenza lokhu nami kuphela.
He was not at home at the time.	Wayengekho kwakhe ngaleso sikhathi.
But he never did that to me.	Kodwa akakaze akwenze lokho nami.
I'm not really sure what you did with this.	Angiqiniseki ngempela ukuthi wenzeni ngalokhu.
It says nothing more.	Akusho okunye.
Just yesterday, me.	Khona izolo, mina.
I want to tell the truth.	Ngifuna ukukhuluma iqiniso.
I would love to see that happen with me.	Ngingathanda ukubona lokho kwenzeka nami.
He looked at you.	Wabheka ngawe.
If so, you need to do something else.	Uma kunjalo, kudingeka wenze okunye.
Not stupid.	Hhayi isilima.
It will definitely be high.	Impela kuzoba phezulu.
And, again, maybe.	Futhi, futhi, mhlawumbe.
Not me, but everyone.	Hhayi mina, kodwa wonke umuntu.
A few times, actually.	Izikhathi ezimbalwa, empeleni.
To do no.	Ukuze wenze cha.
You have to do what you have to do.	Kufanele wenze lokho okufanele ukwenze.
He thought the worst.	Wacabanga okubi kakhulu.
The car to the hospital.	Imoto eya esibhedlela.
I have never been to the city.	Angikaze ngiye ngisho edolobheni.
a lot happened at that time.	kuningi okwenzekile ngaleso sikhathi.
That is not a mistake in that.	Lokho akulona iphutha kulokho.
But this will be between me and him.	Kodwa lokhu kuzoba phakathi kwami ​​naye.
Or a name.	Noma igama.
If it should be.	Uma kufanele kube njalo.
So much needs to be done.	Kuningi kakhulu okudingeka kwenziwe.
He always talks to me.	Uhlale ukhuluma nami.
There is no way for you.	Ayikho indlela yakho.
It was worth nothing.	Bekungafanele lutho.
Anyway how much you want.	Noma kunjalo ufuna kangakanani.
You will be very good at work.	Uzoba muhle kakhulu emsebenzini.
You can do it all by yourself.	Ungakwenza konke uwedwa.
But that is not really the case either.	Kodwa akunjalo ngempela futhi.
It is not something in the world.	Akuyona into emhlabeni.
He and her.	Yena kanye naye.
Or this one.	Noma lena.
I made one.	Ngenza eyodwa.
At the time, she wanted to be a doctor.	Ngaleso sikhathi, wayefuna ukuba udokotela.
And that is what happened to me.	Futhi yilokho okwenzeka kimi.
I didn’t want a bit.	Ngangingafuni kancane.
He pretends he doesn't want to be there.	Wenza sengathi akafuni ukuba lapho.
I can't eat anything.	Angikwazi ukudla lutho.
We have to get there.	Kufanele sithole lapho .
I would just like to know why.	Ngingathanda nje ukwazi ukuthi kungani.
That's fine.	Kuhle kunjalo.
Man wants to fix things.	Umuntu ufuna ukulungisa izinto.
I didn't really know much about him.	Empeleni bengingazi okuningi ngaye.
But this time not alone.	Kodwa kulokhu hhayi yedwa.
It is not always my decision.	Akusona isinqumo sami njalo.
He just couldn't sleep.	Akakwazanga nje ukulala.
Still, he did not want to talk about it.	Noma kunjalo, wayengafuni ukukhuluma ngayo.
The other one starts with me.	Okunye kuqala kimi.
He really thought so.	Wayecabanga kanjalo ngempela.
He'll have to do something soon.	Kuzomele enze okuthile maduze.
I can't wait any longer.	Angikwazi ukulinda okwengeziwe.
This is a bad idea.	Umbono omubi kanje.
Maybe he'll go talk to her.	Mhlawumbe uzohamba akhulume naye.
And a book.	Futhi incwadi.
I should have thought about it a lot.	Bekufanele ngicabange ngakho kakhulu.
This would be really nice.	Lokhu kungaba kuhle ngempela.
He spent months in prison.	Wahlala ejele izinyanga ezimbalwa.
Or seeing things.	Noma ukubona izinto.
I never saw anyone immediately.	Angikaze ngibone muntu ngokushesha.
And he will do something very bad.	Futhi uzokwenza into embi kakhulu.
Thank you always !.	Ngiyabonga njalo!.
Not too high or too low.	Hhayi phezulu kakhulu noma phansi kakhulu.
You think you are sleeping in your room.	Ucabanga ukuthi ulele ekamelweni lakho.
At least, that is what should happen.	Okungenani, yilokho okufanele kwenzeke.
No, it is not.	Akunjalo, akunjalo.
Death would be better.	Ukufa kungaba ngcono.
I want to do that.	Ngifuna ukwenza lokho.
My mother died.	Washona umama.
All in all.	Konke kukho konke.
But it’s actually pretty good anyway.	Kodwa empeleni kuhle kakhulu noma kunjalo.
Don't you want your doctor?	Angithi ufuna udokotela wakho?.
All we have to do is do it.	Okufanele sikwenze ukuthi sikwenze.
If so it is possible.	Uma kunjalo kungenzeka.
Not your problem.	Hhayi inkinga yakho.
Or go.	Noma uhambe.
She later told her son why.	Kamuva watshela indodana yakhe ukuthi kungani.
He will do something.	Uzokwenza okuthile.
Not just getting help.	Hhayi nje ukuthola usizo.
But this is also true.	Kodwa lokhu kuyiqiniso futhi.
So you will not know either way.	Ngakho ngeke wazi noma iyiphi indlela.
You certainly know this.	Impela uyakwazi lokhu.
This is one way.	Lena indlela eyodwa.
Sometimes it may be necessary.	Ngezinye izikhathi kungase kudingeke.
So he came out from behind.	Ngakho waphuma ngemuva.
The question is time consuming.	Umbuzo udlala isikhathi.
I can't tell you everything.	Angikwazi ukukutshela yonke into.
Not much, but at least a few days.	Hhayi okuningi, kodwa okungenani izinsuku ezimbalwa.
I will go for this.	Ngizohamba kulokhu.
Even his family.	Ngisho nomndeni wakhe.
At least, he could not do that at the time.	Okungenani, akakwazanga ukukwenza ngaleso sikhathi.
He knew he wouldn't do it.	Wayazi ukuthi wayengeke akwenze.
She wanted to see her children.	Wayefuna ukubona izingane zakhe.
It is very difficult to fix anything.	Kunzima kabi ukulungisa noma yini.
He will never get better.	Akasoze abe ngcono.
He would not be able to drive like that.	Ubengeke akwazi ukushayela kanjalo.
But this book is a thing of the past.	Kodwa le ncwadi yinto manje.
It’s not a job and it’s not a job.	Akuwona umsebenzi futhi akuwona umsebenzi.
There will be no such thing.	Ngeke kube khona into enjalo.
Yes, yes, but no.	Yebo, yebo, kodwa cha.
To him, he thought.	Kuye, wayecabanga.
I'm not entirely sure why.	Angiqiniseki ngokuphelele ukuthi kungani.
But it is very good, anyway.	Kodwa kuhle kakhulu, noma kunjalo.
This is your exit.	Ukuphuma kwakho lokhu.
Again, this is not a problem.	Futhi, lokhu akuyona inkinga.
Things just happened to him.	Kwenzeka izinto nje kuye.
Only as.	Kuphela njengoba.
This could be life in danger.	Lokhu kungase kube ukuphila engozini.
Not weeks from now.	Hhayi amasonto kusukela manje.
She is wearing very low heels.	Ugqoke phansi kakhulu.
He knows what he can do.	Uyazi ukuthi yini akwazi ukuyenza.
That's fine.	Lokho kuhle.
And he will do that.	Futhi uzokwenza lokho.
You need a big one.	Udinga enkulu.
He even sat next to her.	Wahlala eduze kwakhe ngisho.
I don’t really see how good that can be.	Angiboni ngempela ukuthi lokho kungaba kuhle kanjani.
And where.	Futhi kuphi.
One of us had to.	Omunye wethu kwadingeka.
That could be you.	Kungaba nguwe lowo.
He never goes away, maybe once a year.	Akakaze ahambe, mhlawumbe kanye ngonyaka.
And there is one thing you should know.	Futhi kukhona into eyodwa okufanele uyazi.
If you can help please do so.	Uma ukwazi ukusiza ngicela wenze njalo.

You just need to find the time.	Uzodinga nje ukuthola isikhathi.
Something bad happened there.	Kukhona okubi okwenzekile lapho.
But he is determined.	Kodwa uzimisele.
That happens all the time.	Lokho kwenzeka njalo.
To see you.	Ukukubona .
Maybe not immediately, but in the end.	Mhlawumbe hhayi ngokushesha, kodwa ekugcineni.
I don't see anything about it.	Angiboni lutho ngakho.
We need to find a father or someone.	Sidinga ukuthola ubaba noma othile.
Better, better.	Kungcono, kungcono.
And right here.	Futhi khona lapha.
Yes, to do another.	Yebo, ukwenza enye.

He probably did that.	Kungenzeka wakwenza lokho.
Certainly like us yes.	Impela ngathi yebo.
Mom and all that.	Umama nakho konke lokho.
Almost everyone is asleep.	Cishe wonke umuntu ulele.
I found a gun.	Ngithole isibhamu.
That happens to us all the time.	Lokho kwenzeka kithi ngaso sonke isikhathi.
But with other things.	Kodwa ngezinye izinto.
I'm not sure you know.	Angiqiniseki ukuthi uyazi.
How happy the accident is.	Indlela ejabule kakhulu ngayo ingozi.
He wondered if he was acting foolishly.	Wazibuza ukuthi ngabe wenza isilima.
Probably not at all.	Mhlawumbe akukho nhlobo.
It will happen to you.	Kuzokwenzeka kuwe.
Not even that now.	Akukho ngisho lokho manje.

And this is really the case.	Futhi lokhu kunjalo ngempela.
Certainly never.	Impela angikaze.
He will not come with us.	Angeke eze nathi.
Maybe it doesn't mean anything.	Mhlawumbe akusho lutho.
He may be able to play this week.	Angase akwazi ukudlala kuleli sonto.
But you know it happens, now.	Kodwa uyazi ukuthi kwenzeka, manje.

But he knew it was true.	Kodwa wayazi ukuthi kuyiqiniso.
This is a little true.	Lokhu kuyiqiniso kancane.
Now is the time to act.	Manje sekuyisikhathi sokwenza okuthile.

And he looks very much like her.	Futhi ubukeka ufana naye kakhulu.
Or because of me.	Noma ngenxa yami.
He is near, but not here.	Ulapha eduze, kodwa hhayi lapha.
I'm sorry to say you can't.	Ngiyaxolisa ukusho ukuthi awukwazi.

And it had to be a big deal.	Futhi kwakufanele kube yinto enkulu.
Everyone has been really good to me.	Wonke umuntu ube muhle ngempela kimi.
I tried to think.	Ngazama ukucabanga.
We need to get rid of the police, time.	Sidinga ukuqeda amaphoyisa, isikhathi.
He never tried that.	Akazange azame kanjalo.
Now, nobody here.	Manje, akukho muntu lapha.
I'll be fine there.	Ngizoba kahle lapho.
You can't get into it.	Awukwazi ukungena kukho.
Family is what a family does.	Umndeni yilokho okwenziwa umndeni.

Yes, you read that correctly.	Yebo, ufunda lokhu ngendlela efanele.

But this should not happen.	Kodwa lokhu akufanele kwenzeke.
It's just not your place here.	Ayikho nje indawo yakho lapha.
But do not do it in the middle.	Kodwa ungakwenzi phakathi.

And that happens all the time.	Futhi lokho kwenzeka ngaso sonke isikhathi.
Not in this way.	Akunjalo ngale ndlela.
I want you to think.	Ngifuna ucabange.
I did not leave at that time.	Angizange ngihambe ngaleso sikhathi.
The sound is just good.	Umsindo muhle nje.
So he didn't want to play the right way.	Ngakho wayengafuni ukudlala ngendlela efanele.
He seems so at first.	Ubonakala enjalo ekuqaleni.
I think that's good advice.	Ngicabanga ukuthi iseluleko esihle leso.
Have you heard of it ?.	Uke wezwa ngakho?.
There are so many to choose from.	Kuningi ukukhetha.
You can't do anything in your area right now.	Awukwazi ukwenza lutho endaweni yakho manje.
That's why you have to go.	Yingakho kufanele uhambe.
But sometimes you can't help it.	Kodwa ngezinye izikhathi awukwazi ukukusiza.
I've been here a long time.	Sekuyisikhathi eside ngilapha.
He looked around town.	Wabheka edolobheni.
Mary does all she can.	UMariya wenza konke okusemandleni akhe.
You can do that now.	Ungakwenza lokho manje.
You did your job almost perfectly.	Wenze umsebenzi wakho cishe kahle kakhulu.
But only near you, it seems.	Kodwa kuphela eduze kwakho, kubonakala.
Except for me and him.	Ngaphandle kwami ​​naye.
I also like to do my own thing.	Nami ngithanda ukwenza izinto zami.
Hopefully, you will stay there.	Ngethemba, uzohlala lapho.
I always like to read a book first.	Ngihlale ngithanda ukufunda incwadi kuqala.
Yes he is.	Yebo nguye lowo.
Don't forget about this.	Ungakhohlwa ngalokhu.
This is a house.	Indlu lena.
He has no reason to do so.	Akanaso isizathu sokwenza lokho.
He took the book from me.	Wathatha incwadi kimi.
He said yes to her.	Wathi yebo kuye.
Excellent restaurant.	Indawo yokudlela enhle kakhulu.
No one wants to be down when he arrives.	Akekho ofuna ukuba phansi uma efika.
He came home every night.	Wafika ekhaya ngaso sonke isikhathi ebusuku.
But in this case, not so much.	Kodwa kulokhu, hhayi kakhulu.
I'm not sure what happened from here.	Angiqiniseki ukuthi kwenzakalani kusukela lapha.
Every now and then for me.	Njalo kancane kimi.
He went to the back.	Waya ngemuva.
My mother is human.	Umama ungumuntu.
Dad thinks a lot.	Ubaba ucabanga kakhulu.
But maybe he couldn't.	Kodwa mhlawumbe akakwazanga.
It is not just a phone call.	Akulona nje ucingo.
And this here.	Futhi lokhu lapha.
I found one thing in him.	Ngithole into eyodwa kuye.
But the choice is not one.	Kodwa ukukhetha akuyona eyodwa.
Not so, of course.	Hhayi kanje, kunjalo.
I need to do something to help.	Ngidinga ukwenza okuthile ukuze ngisize.
Actually, not much.	Empeleni, hhayi okuningi.
That's all right.	Kulungile impela.
You do not need to do that.	Awudingi ukuba wenze lokho.
More will be needed.	Kuzodingeka okwengeziwe.
But you can't stay long.	Kodwa awukwazi ukuhlala isikhathi eside.
That might be the one.	Kungase kube nguye lowo.
Now he too sat down.	Manje naye wahlala phansi.
What now? 	Yini manje?
But this was necessary.	Kodwa lokhu kwakudingeka.
In a very good way.	Ngendlela enhle kakhulu.
He just won't stop.	Ngeke nje ayeke.
So, very, very much so.	Ngakho, kakhulu, kakhulu.
It is no small matter.	Akuyona indaba encane.
I know what happened to you too.	Nami ngiyazi ukuthi kwenzekani kuwe.
I'm not that person at all.	Angiyena nhlobo lowo muntu.
We need to.	Sidinga .
Let me think about this.	Ake ngicabange ngalokhu.
We do this.	Senza lokhu.
But it had to happen in the end.	Kodwa kwakufanele kwenzeke ekugcineni.
I had to help.	Kwadingeka ngisize.
It would be hard for me to leave now.	Kungaba nzima ukuthi ngihambe manje.
Testing.	Ukuhlolwa .
I really had to go.	Kwadingeka ngihambe ngempela.
I could see that she was happy too.	Ngabona ukuthi naye ujabule ngendlela efanayo.
Only you know about this, right now.	Nguwe kuphela owaziyo ngalokhu, manje.
They say no.	Bathi hhayi.
You know that.	Uyakwazi lokho .
Absolutely time.	Isikhathi ngokuphelele.
We need to stay here.	Sidinga ukuhlala lapha.
You should have told me.	Bekufanele ungitshele.
Yes, the whole case.	Yebo, lonke icala.
You just have to read.	Kudingeka nje ukufunda.
It doesn’t have to be all or nothing.	Akudingekile ukuba kube konke noma lutho.
Hopefully, that time now.	Ngethemba, leso sikhathi manje.
But you think you know it all.	Kodwa ucabanga ukuthi wazi konke.
Sure, anyone can.	Impela, noma ubani angakwazi.
Our new life.	Impilo yethu entsha.
But a little bit of this.	Kodwa kancane kulokhu.
So you have to do your homework.	Ngakho kufanele wenze umsebenzi wakho wesikole.
You go where you have to play.	Uya lapho kufanele ukudlala khona.
He would not read.	Wayengeke afunde.
I've never heard that.	Angikaze ngizwe lokho.
That's the way to do it.	Leyo indlela yokwenza.
Sometimes that is true, but it is not always true.	Ngezinye izikhathi lokho kuyiqiniso, kodwa akulona neze iqiniso ngaso sonke isikhathi.
It is not water.	Akuwona amanzi.
I am very happy with him now.	Ngijabule kakhulu naye manje.
Last week.	Ngesonto eledlule.
I wish he could do it.	Ngifisa sengathi angenza.
In doing so, he made a mistake.	Ngokwenza kanjalo, wenza iphutha.
That is not the name.	Akulona igama lelo .
He started asking again.	Waqala wacela futhi.
I only suspect that it may be new.	Ngisola kuphela ukuthi kungenzeka entsha.
Obviously not.	Ngokusobala akekho.
I will not allow evil on him.	Ngeke ngivumele okubi kuye.
That is not a danger.	Akuyona ingozi leyo.
I did not always.	Angizange njalo.
I wanted to play.	Ngangifuna ukudlala.
He can do this himself.	Angakwenza yena lokhu.
And last year again, the same thing.	Futhi ngonyaka odlule futhi, into efanayo.
He got things.	Wathola izinto.
No I don't think so.	Cha angicabangi kanjalo.
He has no life, no time.	Akanayo impilo, isikhathi.
You have an error here.	Unephutha lapha.
Another three months, maybe.	Ezinye izinyanga ezintathu, mhlawumbe.
But this was not my mother.	Kodwa kwakungeyena umama wami lo.
Not yet, but you will know soon.	Hhayi okwamanje, kodwa uzokwazi maduze.
Even if you play alone.	Noma ngabe udlala wedwa.
This will happen at night.	Lokhu kuzokwenzeka ebusuku.
We actually found the same thing.	Empeleni sithole into efanayo.
But something must be done.	Kodwa kufanele kwenziwe okuthile.
It's better to see you too.	Kungcono ukukubona nawe.
But it will be hard to hear.	Kodwa kuzoba nzima ukuzwa.
I'm glad you did.	Ngiyajabula ukuthi wena.
Or maybe not.	Noma mhlawumbe akekho.
I had a good, good time.	Ngibe nesikhathi esihle, esihle.
This is so.	Lokhu kunjalo.
We did not find out how.	Asizange sithole ukuthi kwenzeke kanjani.
Now he came and went with me.	Manje wafika wahamba nami.
But the reason, of course, is.	Kodwa isizathu, kunjalo, .
He would never do it again, either.	Wayengeke aphinde, futhi.
You learn more on your own.	Ufunda okwengeziwe eyedwa.
One, because you want to play.	Omunye, ngoba ufuna ukudlala.
Certainly the boy did not want to leave.	Impela umfana wayengafuni ukuhamba.
Or be a teacher.	Noma ube uthisha.
Not really for us.	Hhayi ngenxa yethu ngempela.
I can't, he thought, stay here.	Angikwazi, wacabanga, ukuhlala lapha.
But the same way.	Kodwa indlela efanayo.
I don't know where but.	Angazi ukuthi kuphi kodwa.
He was not sure if it was true.	Wayengenaso isiqiniseko sokuthi kuyiqiniso.
Same story here.	Indaba efanayo lapha.
He did not want to say that.	Wayengafuni ukusho njalo.
Not a cat though.	Hhayi ikati kodwa.
A little like you, a little like me.	Kancane njengawe, kancane njengami.
And it was worth it.	Futhi bekufanele.
You must come home now.	Kuzomele ufike ekhaya manje.
In the afternoon he came home.	Ntambama wafika ekhaya.
But your choice to do.	Kodwa ukukhetha kwakho ukwenza.
More on his channel !.	Okuningi esiteshini sakhe!.
I think, really, she is very beautiful.	Ngicabanga, ngempela, muhle kakhulu.
She is afraid to be alone.	Uyesaba ukuba yedwa.
But nothing really.	Kodwa akukho lutho ngempela.
There is a dog.	Kukhona inja.
That can be difficult to do.	Lokho kungaba nzima ukukwenza.
So it was good.	Ngakho kube kuhle.
Almost nothing.	Cishe akukho lutho.
Or maybe a dog.	Noma mhlawumbe inja.
Well, yes, that's right.	Kulungile, yebo, kunjalo.
You can always buy a new one.	Ungakwazi ukuthenga entsha njalo.
He had to learn.	Kwadingeka afunde.
I will never speak to him again.	Angeke ngiphinde ngikhulume naye.
But this happened quickly.	Kodwa lokhu kwenzeka ngokushesha.
You need to play every day.	Udinga ukudlala nsuku zonke.
Music is air.	Umculo umoya.
If it is true, it is.	Uma kuyiqiniso, kunjalo.
The idea in this case is wrong.	Umqondo kulokhu unephutha.
As you are here.	Njengoba ulapha.
i will be here for you.	ngizoba lapha ngenxa yakho.
He looked thirty.	Wayebukeka engamashumi amathathu.
Only an idea.	Umbono kuphela.
He got some.	Wathola ezinye.
You know, he really does exist.	Uyazi, ukhona ngempela.
He looked at the pictures for a long time.	Wabuka izithombe isikhathi eside.
Everyone wants to be here.	Wonke umuntu ufuna ukuba lapha.
I knew it would be difficult today.	Ngangazi ukuthi namuhla kuzoba nzima.
He has done our job.	Wenze umsebenzi wethu.
He knew about it, of course.	Wayazi ngakho, kunjalo.
But he felt better.	Kodwa wezwa kahle.
I should have thought this way before.	Bekufanele ngicabange ngale ndlela ngaphambili.
There may be something here.	Kungase kube khona okuthile lapha.
Because it probably won't happen.	Ngoba cishe ngeke kwenzeke.
Only when it happens.	Kuphela lapho kwenzeka.
You probably never thought of that before.	Mhlawumbe awukaze ucabange ngalokho ngaphambili.
Another big mistake.	Elinye iphutha elikhulu.
You are wrong about everything else.	Unephutha ngakho konke okunye.
He must have felt the same way.	Kumelwe ukuba naye wazizwa ngendlela efanayo.
I could not speak for a moment.	Angikwazanga ukukhuluma isikhashana.
My wonderful team and my family.	Iqembu lami elihle kanye nomndeni wami.
We do the same thing every day.	Senza into efanayo nsuku zonke.
Doctor out here.	Udokotela lapha ngaphandle.
But there is something about you.	Kodwa kukhona okuthile ngawe.
It will not be alone.	Ngeke kube yedwa.
I thought it was okay.	Bengicabanga ukuthi kulungile.
He used to be like that.	Wayevame ukuba njalo.
He loves death.	Uthanda ukufa.
He says there is nothing wrong with him.	Uthi akukho okubi ngaye.
Not so far, at least.	Hhayi kuze kube manje, okungenani.
I would not be that stupid.	Ngeke ngibe isilima leso.
And he will do this with me.	Futhi uzokwenza lokhu nami.
He knows he can't eat tonight.	Uyazi ukuthi ngeke akwazi ukudla namuhla ebusuku.
The idea is good.	Umqondo muhle.
But, well, it's good to go.	Kodwa, kulungile, kuhle ukuhamba.
To him, maybe, but not me.	Kuye, mhlawumbe, kodwa hhayi mina.
Anytime since then.	Noma nini kusukela ngaleso sikhathi.
It should not be too much.	Akufanele kube okuningi.
A really small child.	Ingane encane ngempela.
I want to live to be a father.	Ngifuna ukuphila ngibe ubaba.
Prolonged hospital stay.	Ukuhlala isikhathi eside esibhedlela.
I can't go on, like this.	Angikwazi ukuqhubeka, kanje.
Really, he wanted to make a mistake.	Ngempela, wayefuna ukwenza iphutha.
It must have been three years ago.	Kumelwe ukuba eminyakeni emithathu edlule.
Your daughter will be back.	Uzobuya intombi yakho.
He knew when he got home late for work.	Wayazi uma efika ekhaya sekwephuzile emsebenzini.
We all want to play every day.	Sonke sifuna ukudlala nsuku zonke.
Actually I'm not sure.	Empeleni angiqiniseki.
But anyone can do that.	Kodwa noma ubani angakwenza lokho.
We have a lot to do regularly.	Kuningi okufanele sikwenze njalo.
He would not be alone in this.	Ubengeke abe yedwa kulokhu.
My only child.	Ingane yami ngedwa.
Now, again, there you go.	Manje, futhi, nakho lapho uhamba.
But there is another idea.	Kodwa kukhona futhi omunye umbono.
You want to do this a little bit.	Ufuna ukwenza lokhu kancane.
That's great for you.	Kuhle kakhulu kuwe lokho.
I live upstairs.	Ngihlala phezulu.
And I've been here.	Futhi kade ngilapha.
Tom would have made money.	UTom ngabe wenze imali.
Being close to you.	Ukuba eduze kwakho.
He doesn't know why.	Akazi ngani.
Or even the wind.	Noma ngisho umoya.
He wants to be with me, all the time.	Ufuna ukuba nami, ngaso sonke isikhathi.
Your father left.	Ubaba wakho wahamba.
Little or no meat.	Inyama encane noma engekho.
He must try to think.	Kumele azame ukucabanga.
He could not control himself.	Akazange akwazi ukuzibamba.
I want you to stay close to me.	Ngifuna uhlale eduze kwami.
A picture is not a good picture.	Isithombe akusona isithombe esihle.
But don't make it too easy.	Kodwa ungakwenzi kube lula kakhulu.
Most of the time alone.	Isikhathi esiningi uwedwa.
I wish there was more.	Ngifisa sengathi ngabe kukhona okwengeziwe.
If he does leave, he may never return.	Uma ehamba, angase angaphinde abuye.
That is, it is not in the middle.	Yilokho, akukho phakathi.
That one is very visible.	Lowo ubonakala kakhulu.
One thing to consider.	Into eyodwa okufanele ucabange ngayo.
There is no power in it.	Akukho amandla ngakho.
And we did everything.	Futhi senze yonke into.
Bad accident.	Ingozi embi.
No one but him.	Akekho ngaphandle kwakhe.
I did not receive a call.	Angizange ngithole ucingo.
He should have known that this was going to happen.	Bekumele azi ukuthi lokhu kuzokwenzeka.
Dad can't read music.	Ubaba akakwazi ukufunda umculo.
You can do it, you just don't want to.	Ungakwenza, awufuni nje.
He had been sitting in his car.	Ubelokhu ehlala emotweni yakhe.
I did something.	Ngenze into.
The boy can cook.	Umfana uyakwazi ukupheka.
I would love to see what he finally does.	Ngingathanda ukubona ukuthi ekugcineni wenzani.
He knew now that he was gone.	Wayazi manje ukuthi akekho.
I've been thinking about it for a long time.	Sekuyisikhathi eside ngicabanga ngakho.
I asked, obviously.	Ngabuza, kusobala.
This is very good, and as it should be.	Lokhu kuhle kakhulu, futhi njengoba kufanele kube njalo.
But hard enough.	Kodwa kunzima ngokwanele.
But he was not so much.	Kodwa wayengekho kakhulu.
And the answer is that there is no right answer.	Futhi impendulo ukuthi ayikho impendulo efanele.
Also, does anyone want to see you?	Futhi, ingabe kukhona umuntu afuna ukukubona.
Everything else.	Konke okunye .
He went yesterday.	Uye izolo.
He wants to be.	Ufuna ukuba .
Just something about you.	Into nje ngawe.
Nobody down there.	Akukho muntu phansi lapho.
But a lot of noise is coming.	Kodwa umsindo omkhulu uyeza.
I just didn’t think about it.	Angizange nje ngicabange ngakho.
My father? 	Ubaba wami?
Time for me.	Isikhathi kimi.
It happens a lot here.	Kwenzeka kakhulu lapha.
And now, we're doing much better.	Futhi manje, senza kangcono kakhulu.
I thought it would be a few weeks, maybe.	Bengicabanga ukuthi kuzoba amasonto ambalwa, mhlawumbe.
So now this.	Ngakho manje lokhu.
I can't believe it.	Angikholwa mina.
This function works properly.	Lo msebenzi usebenza ngendlela efanele.
Beautiful little house.	Indlu encane enhle.
But not only him.	Kodwa hhayi yena kuphela.
But that happened to me for many years.	Kodwa lokho kwenzeka kimi iminyaka eminingi.
He says he thinks of his girlfriend.	Uthi ucabanga intombi yakhe.
I mean, really, really good.	Ngisho, ngempela, kuhle ngempela.
But I never thought.	Kodwa angizange ngicabange.
I want you to tell me no.	Ngifuna angitshele ukuthi cha.
Another of our years.	Enye iminyaka yethu.
Also, you will need to reset your problem first.	Futhi, uzodinga ukulungisa kabusha inkinga yakho kuqala.
And it is not a day.	Futhi akulona usuku.
Today is our little party.	Namuhla iphathi yethu encane.
It shouldn't, but it's not a big deal.	Akufanele, kodwa akuyona into enkulu.
In fact, that is simply not true.	Empeleni, lokho akulona iqiniso ngokuphelele.
At least not now.	Okungenani, hhayi njengamanje.
At least not this week.	Okungenani hhayi kuleli sonto.
That should be soon.	Lokho kufanele kube maduze.
Not so in the world.	Akunjalo emhlabeni wonke.
He does not know alone.	Akazi yedwa.
And it can be harder than it seems.	Futhi kungaba nzima kunalokho kubonakala.
She and I.	Yena nami.
You should go with your family.	Kufanele uhambe kanye nomndeni wakho.
Maybe not, but it seems.	Mhlawumbe akunjalo, kodwa kubonakala sengathi.
Good enough, really.	Kuhle ngokwanele, ngempela.
But really, yes.	Kodwa empeleni, yebo.
I said to myself.	Ngisho kimi.
His family, too.	Umndeni wakhe, futhi.
I thought about fixing my car.	Ngicabange ukulungisa imoto yami.
I saw my father.	Ngabona ubaba.
I would love to hear all about it.	Ngingathanda ukuzwa konke ngakho.
We all have a lot to do.	Kuningi okumele sikwenze sonke.
It has to be.	Kumelwe kube njalo.
Not all the way but some of you.	Hhayi yonke indlela kodwa okunye kwakho.
Everyone feels this way.	Wonke umuntu uzizwa ngale ndlela.
No, not water.	Cha, hhayi amanzi.
I think he can do it all.	Ngicabanga ukuthi angakwenza konke.
But this is something else.	Kodwa lokhu okunye.
So far, it is very clear.	Kuze kube manje, kusobala kakhulu.
Obviously, it can be.	Ngokusobala, kungaba njalo.
I want to live on earth.	Ngifuna ukuphila emhlabeni.
Maybe he should have been, but he wasn't.	Mhlawumbe kwakufanele abe njalo, kodwa wayengekho.
But again, you know this.	Kodwa futhi, uyakwazi lokhu.
That is difficult when one is doing so.	Kunzima lokho uma umuntu enza kanjalo.
You do your job in the best way possible.	Wenza umsebenzi wakho ngendlela engcono kakhulu.
This is not just everyone, everyone together.	Lokhu akuwona wonke umuntu nje, wonke umuntu ndawonye.
In this case, it would be better.	Kulokhu, kungaba ngcono.
So that's a big question for you.	Ngakho lowo umbuzo omkhulu kuwe.
The question here.	Umbuzo lapha.
But he could not, not yet.	Kodwa akakwazanga, hhayi njengamanje.
This we do not know about others.	Lokhu asikwazi ngezinye.
He expects to spend time with her.	Ulindele ukuchitha isikhathi naye.
So do I.	Kunjalo nami.
We are currently redesigning.	Okwamanje senza kabusha.
I would really like to know.	Ngingathanda ngempela ukwazi.
He did not want to go back home.	Wayengafuni ukubuyela ekhaya.
I found a very good plan.	Ngithole icebo elihle kakhulu.
Not me, my father.	Akumina, ubaba wami.
He decided immediately.	Wanquma ngokushesha.
Not at all.	Hhayi nhlobo.
We need to make a noise.	Kudingeka senze umsindo.
Now he has to do what he does best.	Manje kufanele enze lokho akwenza kahle kakhulu.
He cannot and will not know that he exists.	Akakwazi futhi akasoze azi ukuthi ukhona.
I actually thought so.	Empeleni ngacabanga kanjalo.
I just don't know when.	Angazi nje ukuthi nini.
But not too many.	Kodwa hhayi amaningi kakhulu.
Your friend knows a lot.	Umngane wakho wazi okuningi.
You need to stay here.	Udinga ukuhlala lapha.
I’m glad to get out there early and soon.	Ngiyajabula ukuphuma lapho kusenesikhathi futhi ngokushesha.
The big man came out at night.	Umuntu omkhulu waphuma ebusuku.
That, too, is not a bad thing.	Lokho, nakho, akuyona into embi.
Who do you think you will win ?.	Ucabanga ukuthi uzowina bani?.
And this is not a really good idea.	Futhi lokhu akuwona umbono omuhle ngempela.
I had a great time.	Ngenze isikhathi esihle kakhulu.
I knew my family would do it.	Ngangazi ukuthi umndeni wami uzokwenza.
There is only him.	Kukhona yena kuphela.
I went to him.	ngiye kuye.
I came anyway.	Ngize noma kunjalo.
She tried to cry.	Wazama ukukhala.
I could not speak for long.	Angikwazanga ukukhuluma isikhathi eside.
You are wrong if you think so.	Unephutha uma ucabanga kanjalo.
I'm sorry to say this.	Ngiyaxolisa ukusho lokhu.
My family has gone well for me.	Umndeni wami uhambe kahle ngami.
But big money.	Kodwa imali enkulu.
You need to find out more.	Udinga ukuthola okwengeziwe.
I never thought about it before.	Bengingacabangi ngakho ngaphambili.
If you do, that's fine.	Uma wenza, kulungile.
At least a few months.	Okungenani izinyanga ezimbalwa.
There is at least one.	Okungenani kukhona eyodwa.
But that is just a problem.	Kodwa leyo inkinga nje.
And you should not be.	Futhi akufanele ube.
Yes, it could be much better.	Yebo, kungaba ngcono kakhulu.
And not just to talk about it.	Futhi hhayi nje ukukhuluma ngakho.
And maybe not immediately.	Futhi mhlawumbe hhayi ngokushesha.
You may know some things but not others.	Ungakwazi ukwazi ezinye izinto kodwa hhayi ezinye.
Say it with me.	Asho kanye nami.
But all in all.	Kodwa konke kukho konke.
I wish it could be so.	Ngifisa sengathi kungaba njalo.
I should have done the right thing.	Kufanele ngabe ngenza into efanele.
We have done everything.	Senze konke.
Not long after that again.	Hhayi isikhathi eside kamuva futhi.
And all this.	Futhi konke lokhu.
To do that, you need people in your end.	Ukuze wenze lokho, udinga abantu ekugcineni kwakho.
He made a party.	Wenza iqembu.
But he is actually there.	Kodwa empeleni ukhona.
At least that's not the whole story.	Okungenani, akuyona yonke indaba leyo.
I thought you knew that.	Bengicabanga ukuthi uyakwazi lokho.
So maybe it wasn’t.	Ngakho mhlawumbe kwakungeyena.
He did not go today.	Akazange namuhla.
His work is very good.	Muhle kakhulu umsebenzi wakhe.
I think we should do it right.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kufanele sikwenze kahle.
I'm scared of people.	Ngesaba abantu.
I made sense.	Ngenza umqondo.
So it's hard.	Ngakho kunzima.
But he never wanted to.	Kodwa akakaze afune.
He refused to work.	Wenqaba ukusebenza.
But it has to be better.	Kodwa kufanele kube ngcono.
Maybe once a week or something.	Mhlawumbe kanye ngesonto noma okuthile.
He got a call.	Wathola ucingo.
He came and opened it.	Wafika wavula.
He did what he could.	Wenza okusemandleni akhe.
You will do this again.	Uzobuya wenze lokhu futhi.
How am I going to do about it.	Ngizokwenza kanjani ngakho.
I need my time.	Ngidinga isikhathi sami.
But he told the people everything that had happened.	Kodwa watshela abantu ngakho konke okwenzekile.
I thought for a moment.	Ngacabanga isikhashana .
There is no single place.	Ayikho indawo eyodwa.
He should have told me.	Bekumele angitshele.
Not just good enough.	Hhayi nje kuhle ngokwanele.
Of course you can.	Impela ungakwazi.
We want it this way.	Sifuna kube ngale ndlela.
He came and tried to talk to me again.	Weza wazama ukukhuluma nami futhi.
I can do it later.	Ngingakwenza kamuva.
One, not.	Enye, hhayi.
And everyone did.	Futhi wonke umuntu wenza kanjalo.
He walks as he always does.	Ehamba njengoba ehlala enza.
He can't fix things.	Akakwazi ukulungisa izinto.
Lies, lies, lies.	Amanga, amanga, amanga.
There is only your way.	Kukhona indlela yakho kuphela.
How else? 	Kanjani futhi?
It must be done immediately.	Kumele kwenziwe ngokushesha.
That is not the point.	Akuwona umqondo lowo.
But now.	Kodwa manje .
Every breath.	Njalo umoya.
I don't even know how this happened.	Angazi nokuthi kwenzeka kanjani lokhu.
For me, just like me.	Ngami, njengami.
My mother spoke up.	Umama wakhuluma.
I really think it could be.	Ngicabanga ngempela ukuthi kungaba njalo.
Well, good enough.	Kuhle, kulungile ngokwanele.
This just happened.	Lokhu kwenzeka nje.
But he did not, at least not immediately.	Kodwa akazange, okungenani hhayi ngaso leso sikhathi.
And it happened in the end.	Futhi kwenzeka ekugcineni.
In his absence.	Lapho engekho.
And the same thing again.	Futhi into efanayo futhi.
Not me, him.	Hhayi mina, yena.
One would never say, of course.	Umuntu akasoze asho, kunjalo.
Time to say no.	Isikhathi sokuthi cha.
I do not want him to go to prison.	Angifuni ukuthi aye ejele.
My mother was away for a long time.	Umama wayengekho isikhathi esiningi.
We know what happened in the end.	Siyazi ukuthi kwenzekani ekugcineni.
Sounds like it happened very quickly.	Kuzwakala sengathi kwenzeke ngokushesha okukhulu.
Hard but good.	Kunzima kodwa kuhle.
I would really like that.	Ngingathanda kakhulu lokho.
So you do not want to.	Ngakho awufuni.
That is absolutely unnecessary.	Lokho akudingekile neze.
He sat down very quietly.	Wahlala phansi kakhulu.
Certainly, a great answer.	Impela, impendulo enkulu.
He knows all the police in town.	Wazi wonke amaphoyisa edolobheni.
I have to speak well of this now.	Kufanele ngikhulume kahle ngalokhu manje.
It will be easier than you think.	Kuzoba lula kunalokho ucabanga.
I am the one who has to talk to him.	Yimina okumele ngikhulume naye.
He is not sure what to do now.	Akanaso isiqiniseko sokuthi kufanele enzeni manje.
That's what you should be thinking about.	Yilokho okufanele ngabe ucabanga ngakho.
I'm totally sorry.	Ngiyaxolisa ngokuphelele.
There is so much he can do.	Kuningi angakwenza.
Sometimes a little bit, sometimes a little bit.	Ngezinye izikhathi kancane kancane, ngezinye izikhathi kancane kancane.
I could not do better.	Angikwazanga ukwenza kangcono.
He is very alone.	Wedwa kakhulu.
I didn't think it would be good.	Bengingacabangi ukuthi kuzoba kuhle.
Almost there.	Cishe lapho.
You work all the time you work.	Usebenza ngaso sonke isikhathi usebenza.
This will happen soon.	Lokhu kuzokwenzeka maduze nje.
I can't do anything about this.	Angikwazi ukwenza lutho kulokhu.
Okay, not just the top.	Kulungile, hhayi nje phezulu.
It's hard to find a way to proceed.	Kunzima ukuthola ukuqhubeka.
He sits down.	Uhlala phansi.
In this he said yes.	Kulokhu uthe yebo.
At least you should know what you are doing.	Okungenani kufanele wazi ukuthi wenzani.
And he did and he did.	Futhi wenza futhi wenza.
I will be too.	Nami ngizoba njalo.
Now he never spoke to her.	Manje akazange akhulume nhlobo naye.
The answer is probably yes, maybe no.	Impendulo mhlawumbe yebo, mhlawumbe cha.
Only me, only me.	Mina kuphela, mina kuphela.
That you exist.	Ukuthi ukhona.
Now you know.	Manje uyazi.
He knew beforehand.	Wayazi ngaphambili.
Thank you for coming here so much.	Ngiyabonga ukuthi eze lapha kakhulu.
But you should not be here.	Kodwa akufanele ube lapha.
Bad idea from the beginning.	Umbono omubi kusukela ekuqaleni.
He also did not want problems.	Naye wayengafuni izinkinga.
Right now, actually.	Njengamanje, empeleni.
I am completely happy with everything.	Ngijabule ngokuphelele ngakho konke.
You need to know what to do.	Udinga ukwazi ukuthi enzeni.
You are this person right now.	Uwena lo muntu njengamanje.
Clearly, something needed to be done.	Ngokusobala, kukhona okwakudingeka kwenziwe.
We do it over and over again.	Senza njalo njalo.
Something is constantly happening to us.	Kukhona okwenzeka njalo kithi.
Not all water, either.	Akuwona wonke amanzi, futhi.
That is not a guarantee.	Lokho akusona isiqiniseko.
But there is also a great truth.	Kodwa kukhona futhi iqiniso elikhulu.
Please, let me.	Ngicela, ngivumele.
His spirit, too.	Umoya wakhe, futhi.
He also sleeps well but not at night.	Naye ulele kahle kodwa hhayi ebusuku.
Just as you will go.	Njengoba nje uzohamba.
Let me be with you on this.	Ngivumele ngibe nawe kulokhu.
Or both, maybe, if both.	Noma nobabili, mhlawumbe, uma nobabili.
So that's not it.	Ngakho akukhona lokho.
I left for a while.	Ngihambe isikhashana.
I have to think about work.	Kufanele ngicabange ngomsebenzi.
Dad says he should come more often.	Ubaba uthi kufanele eze kaningi.
Yes thinking is good.	Yebo ukucabanga kuhle.
Just a big ball.	Ibhola elikhulu nje.
And he knew everyone.	Futhi wayazi wonke umuntu.
But since then nothing.	Kodwa kusukela lapho lutho.
I think that's probably right.	Ngicabanga ukuthi lokho mhlawumbe kulungile.
Her children, her friends.	Izingane zakhe, abangani bakhe.
Maybe he's a good guy.	Mhlawumbe ungumfana omuhle.
Good man.	Umuntu omuhle.
You will be, now, about your age.	Uzoba, manje, cishe iminyaka yakho.
Not just our age, every age.	Hhayi nje iminyaka yethu, yonke iminyaka.
My children are my children.	Izingane zami izingane zami.
You say the same thing.	Nawe usho into efanayo.
Without him, it would be difficult.	Ngaphandle kwakhe, kungaba nzima.
Looks like I can't find the problem.	Kubonakala sengathi angikwazi ukuthola inkinga.
We can't tell you what you did.	Asikwazi ukukutshela ukuthi wenzeni.
I will never say, he thought.	Angisoze ngisho, wacabanga.
He is a happy man.	Uyindoda ejabule.
He said he would like to.	Wathi angathanda.
He should be taller than me.	Kufanele abe mude kakhulu kunami.
And, your mother knows, she always knows.	Futhi, umama wakho uyazi, uyazi njalo.
It could be a lot of water.	Kungaba amanzi amaningi.
I never thought he knew this.	Angikaze ngicabange ukuthi uyakwazi lokhu.
Hope to see you soon!.	Ngifisa ukukubona maduze!.
Good, but that's not all.	Kuhle, kodwa akukhona lokho kuphela.
Who knows.	Ubani owaziyo.
But he, of course, knew.	Kodwa yena, yebo, wayazi.
And he made his way up high.	Futhi wenza indlela yakhe phezulu ngendlela efanele.
It would be life in danger.	Kungaba ukuphila engozini.
None of this should be done now.	Akukho kulokhu okumele kwenziwe manje.
He did not want to ride.	Wayengafuni ukugibela.
We can't do anything anyway.	Asikwazi ukwenza lutho noma kunjalo.
I mean, thank you very much.	Ngisho, ngiyabonga kakhulu.
All right, enough to cry.	Kulungile, ukukhala ngokwanele.
You must be willing to do so.	Kumelwe uzimisele ukwenza kanjalo.
Maybe you think you did.	Mhlawumbe ucabanga ukuthi ukwenzile.
You just need to go.	Udinga nje ukuhamba.
How you can do that could be your problem.	Ungakwenza kanjani lokho kungaba inkinga yakho.
I saw my dress.	Ngabona ingubo yami.
We make a lot of money.	Senza imali eningi.
I long to hear his voice.	Ngifisa ukuzwa izwi lakhe.
Your coat.	Ijazi lakho.
She's worried about who knows.	Ukhathazekile ngokuthi ubani owaziyo.
I don't know if he can do it.	Angazi noma angakwazi yini ukukwenza.
I can't remember exactly what it was.	Angisakhumbuli kahle ukuthi iyiphi.
Such a bad time.	Isikhathi esibi kangako.
But many problems.	Kodwa izinkinga eziningi.
Food is not a good thing.	Ukudla akuyona into enhle.
Almost everyone looked happy.	Cishe wonke umuntu wayebukeka ejabule.
Not this one though.	Hhayi lena noma kunjalo.
We need an idea.	Sidinga umbono.
I can't remember the place very well.	Angisakhumbuli kahle indawo.
How to do that.	Ukwenza kanjani lokho.
Not yet, they say.	Hhayi okwamanje, bathi.
That happened.	Kwenzekani lokho.
He would really like to work here.	Angathanda ngempela ukusebenza lapha.
Indeed, this is possible.	Ngempela, lokhu kungenzeka.
I was thinking of driving home for the weekend.	Bengicabanga ukushayela ekhaya ngempelasonto.
I, too, do not like it.	Nami, angithandi.
Now let me tell you one thing.	Manje ake ngikutshele into eyodwa.
Still people.	Namanje abantu.
You did not know it for the rest of your life.	Ubungazi impilo yakho yonke.
I wish someone would tell me this soon.	Ngifisa sengathi othile angitshele lokhu ngokushesha.
That will probably not happen soon.	Lokho cishe ngeke kwenzeke maduze.
Someone has to do it for a while.	Omunye kufanele akwenze isikhashana.
Not you.	Cha wena.
Questions are a good thing.	Imibuzo yinto enhle.
A very big story.	Indaba enkulu impela.
He did not commit any crime.	Akazange enze icala.
If something happens to him.	Uma kwenzeka okuthile kuye .
You really like it.	Uthanda ngempela.
That is there.	Lokho kukhona.
But he knew he wasn't.	Kodwa wayazi ukuthi wayengeyena.
She is going to college.	Uya ekolishi.
There is no one in the room.	Akekho umuntu ekamelweni.
I need to stay informed about it.	Ngidinga ukuhlala ngazi ngakho.
And the same thing happened here.	Futhi kwenzeka into efanayo lapha.
But he will not know.	Kodwa ngeke azi.
Not as beautiful as I am, but very beautiful.	Hhayi muhle njengami, kodwa muhle kakhulu.
There is no one else near him.	Akekho omunye ngisho eduze kwakhe.
You have done a very bad thing.	Wenze kabi kakhulu.
I wanted to do a good job.	Ngangifuna ukwenza umsebenzi omuhle.
He sits up there.	Uhlala phezulu lapho.
I have to be good at this.	Kufanele ngibe muhle kulokhu.
But it can also be a waste of time.	Kodwa futhi kungase kube ukuchitha isikhathi.
i will do well.	ngizokwenza kahle.
She is so beautiful !.	Muhle kakhulu!.
No, not at all.	Cha cha, hhayi kulokhu.
You need a doctor here.	Udinga udokotela lapha.
Or, you know, she's pretty good.	Noma, uyazi, cishe muhle.
He's actually a great guy.	Empeleni ungumfana omkhulu.
He loves his place.	Uthanda indawo yakhe.
I want this to be good.	Ngifuna lokhu kube kuhle.
I'll be fine! 	Ngizoba muhle!
He always did.	Wenza njalo njalo.
A lot, though.	Kuningi, noma kunjalo.
Right there on the floor.	Khona lapho phansi.
He did not know who would be there.	Wayengazi ukuthi kuzoba nobani.
And, yes, that is possible.	Futhi, yebo, lokho kungenzeka.
But that's a lot.	Kodwa lokho kuningi.
So far I like it all.	Kuze kube manje ngithanda konke ngakho.
Better, but not better.	Kungcono, kodwa hhayi kahle.
At least until lunch.	Okungenani kuze kube isidlo sasemini.
He decided to talk again, and left.	Wanquma ukukhuluma futhi, wahamba.
Well, you would never know.	Kulungile, ubungeke wazi.
That's what man does.	Yilokho umuntu akwenza.
A lot, you know.	Kuningi, uyazi.
This, he says, is very true.	Lokhu, uthi, kuyiqiniso kakhulu.
I want to make one.	Ngifuna ukwenza eyodwa.
He seemed very happy to be here.	Wayebonakala ejabule kakhulu ukuba lapha.
The story of you.	Indaba ngani.
Just the first one.	Okokuqala nje kuphela.
Of course he never spoke.	Yebo akakaze akhulume.
We all know that it is true.	Sonke siyazi ukuthi kuyiqiniso.
I'm really very happy.	Impela ngijabule kakhulu.
I better do something.	Kungcono ngenze okuthile.
I just love music.	Ngithanda umculo nje.
You better go again.	Kungcono uhambe futhi.
He just heard.	Wezwa nje.
Everyone will be living there.	Wonke umuntu uzobe ehlala lapho.
Obviously, something has to go.	Ngokusobala, kukhona okufanele ahambe.
Now, we really need to make a decision.	Manje, sidinga ngempela ukwenza isinqumo.
I know how to do my job.	Ngiyazi ukwenza umsebenzi wami.
Of course you do not want to do it.	Yebo awufuni ukukwenza.
And this will happen in the end.	Futhi lokhu kuzokwenzeka ekugcineni.
He pulled everyone out.	Wakhipha wonke umuntu.
Sounds longer than that.	Kuzwakala isikhathi eside kunalokho.
He started all my work.	Waqala umsebenzi wami wonke.
How would you like to help.	Ungathanda ukusiza kanjani.
You would not tell me his name.	Ubungeke ungitshele igama lakhe.
When, we cannot say.	Nini, asikwazi ukusho.
And maybe just so.	Futhi mhlawumbe kunjalo nje.
Who? 	Ubani?
Not in your car.	Hhayi emotweni yakho.
There is nothing here, too, it seems.	Akukho lutho lapha, futhi, kubonakala.
Instead, he received a gift.	Kunalokho, wathola isipho.
It's great to see this.	Kuhle kakhulu ukubona lokhu.
Almost before.	Cishe ngaphambili.
He saw that he needed help.	Wabona ukuthi udinga usizo.
You will need to read it immediately.	Uzodinga ukufunda ngokushesha.
In the end anything can happen.	Ekugcineni kungenzeka noma yini.
So, a decision.	Ngakho, isinqumo.
He would not come today.	Ubengeke eze namuhla.
I don't remember much about it, to be honest.	Angisakhumbuli okuningi ngakho, uma ngikhuluma iqiniso.
You also have to think about it.	Kufanele futhi ucabange ngakho.
She's fine now.	Uhamba kahle manje.
Just a question about your job.	Umbuzo nje ngomsebenzi wakho.
He refused to continue.	Wenqaba ukuqhubeka.
I probably knew a lot at first, I know.	Kungenzeka ukuthi ngangazi okuningi ekuqaleni, ngikwazi.
Maybe he will, maybe not.	Mhlawumbe uzokwenza, mhlawumbe ngeke.
I have to go home.	Kumele ngiye ekhaya.
I'll go with him on that.	Ngizohamba naye kulokho.
He has been there for years.	Ube khona iminyaka.
You told me.	Ungitshele mina.
I would, however.	Ngingathanda, noma kunjalo.
Right there in his office.	Khona lapho ehhovisi lakhe.
I think that's why.	Ngicabanga ukuthi yingakho.
He had always wanted to leave.	Ubelokhu efuna ukuhamba.
He did it later.	Wakwenza kamuva.
I wish it could be just me.	Sengathi kungaba yimina kuphela.
Anyone in the world can do this.	Noma ubani emhlabeni angakwenza lokhu.
Sounds very difficult.	Kuzwakala kunzima kakhulu.
He knew that too.	Wayazi kanjalo naye.
We can't, neither do you.	Asikwazi, nawe futhi.
Or you should at least.	Noma kufanele okungenani.
He appears.	Ubonakala .
I tried once again, if possible.	Ngazama kanye futhi, uma kwenzeka.
I actually want a better life for myself and him.	Empeleni ngifuna impilo engcono mina naye.
It will be very difficult to choose.	Kuzoba nzima kakhulu ukukhetha.
I never, did that.	Angikaze, ngikwenze lokho.
I really think so.	Impela ngicabanga ukuthi kunjalo.
You just want to do it your way.	Ufuna nje ukwenza ngendlela yakho.
They came and felt.	Wafika wazizwa .
You look really good.	Ubukeka kahle ngempela.
But that also does not mean everything.	Kodwa nalokho akusho konke.
Probably no one should have done it the way he did.	Mhlawumbe akekho umuntu okufanele ngabe wenza ngendlela enze ngayo.
Or maybe because of you.	Noma mhlawumbe ngenxa yakho.
Everything will happen tomorrow.	Konke kuzokwenzeka kusasa.
He began to ask.	Waqala wabuza.
Just like that maybe.	Kanjalo nje mhlawumbe.
He decided to get better.	Wanquma ukuba ngcono.
Only you.	Kuphela nje wena.
Except not in a bad way.	Ngaphandle hhayi ngendlela embi.
I have never heard of it since.	Angikaze ngizwe ndawo kusukela ngaleso sikhathi.
I can no longer wait to leave !.	Angisakwazi ukulinda ukuhamba!.
He said yes.	Wathi kunjalo ngempela.
He thought maybe.	Wacabanga mhlawumbe .
Each time, he was afraid.	Njalo lapho kwenzeka, wayesaba.
Maybe I don't see anything.	Mhlawumbe angiboni lutho.
All is not.	Konke akukho.
Or your child.	Noma ingane yakho.
Once in a while again.	Kanye ngesikhathi futhi.
We want to continue with that.	Sifuna ukuqhubeka nalokho.
Of course that's just my opinion.	Yebo nje umbono wami lowo.
He tried to think positively of her.	Wazama ukucabanga kahle ngaye.
Many days, he is.	Izinsuku eziningi, nguye.
He came home later and later.	Wafika ekhaya kamuva futhi kamuva.
I can't eat, sleep, or work without you.	Angikwazi ukudla, ukulala, noma ukusebenza ngaphandle kwakho.
I have to do some things.	Kufanele ngenze ezinye izinto.
Almost everyone wants to be alone at times.	Cishe wonke umuntu ufuna ukuba yedwa ngezinye izikhathi.
Next to everything.	Eduze kukho konke.
I saw something else.	Ngabona okunye futhi.
He stayed in his room too.	Wahlala ekamelweni lakhe kakhulu.
So if it happens.	Ngakho uma kwenzeka.
That would be a good thing to do.	Lokho kuzoba yinto enhle ukuyenza.
Sadly, I want to be with him.	Ubuhlungu, ngifuna ukuba naye.
Except for me obviously.	Ngaphandle kwami ​​ngokusobala.
I made a lot of money.	Ngenza imali eningi kakhulu.
Sometimes we pretend not to.	Ngezinye izikhathi senza sengathi akunjalo.
We made a big mistake a few years ago.	Senze iphutha elikhulu eminyakeni embalwa edlule.
He probably did not know anything at all.	Cishe wayengazi lutho nhlobo.
He once was with me.	Wake waba nami.
Too bad, he can't cook !.	Okubi kakhulu, akakwazi ukupheka!.
We do not have to do it every day.	Akudingekile ukuba sikwenze nsuku zonke.
You have reached the end.	Ufike ekugcineni.
I should have come to you soon.	Bekufanele ngize kuwe ngokushesha.
We never did such a thing.	Asizange senze into enjalo.
Just a bad thing.	Into embi nje.
I know you're not a bad person.	Ngiyazi ukuthi awuyena umuntu omubi.
Yes that.	Yebo lokho.
Now you will need to pick up the phone.	Manje uzodinga ukuthatha ucingo.
But to be honest, that didn't happen to me before.	Kodwa uma ngikhuluma iqiniso, lokho akuzange kwenzeke kimi ngaphambili.
He wondered what the problem was.	Wazibuza ukuthi yini inkinga.
Our whole life.	Impilo yethu yonke.
Food had to be made.	Ukudla bekufanele kwenziwe.
Fast, fast and fast.	Ngokushesha, ngokushesha futhi ngokushesha.
And again.	Futhi futhi .
I just expressed my opinion.	Ngikhulume umbono wami nje.
Not a problem for me.	Akuyona inkinga kimi.
To me, really.	Kimi, ngempela.
I don't want to say that.	Angifuni ukusho lokho.
She also seems worried.	Kubonakala sengathi naye ukhathazekile.
I have gone very, very recently.	Ngihambe kakhulu kakhulu muva nje.
But he will not stop.	Kodwa ngeke ayeke.
I'm not sure my dad ever knew about it.	Anginaso isiqiniseko sokuthi ubaba wake wazi ngakho.
I do not want to try again.	Angifuni ukuzama futhi.
You have to eat everything.	Kufanele udle yonke into.
He said he did not want to.	Wathi akafuni.
My mother also does not think that is right.	Umama naye akacabangi ukuthi lokho kulungile.
And that's what he said.	Futhi yilokho akusho.
I will probably do this alone.	Cishe ngizokwenza lokhu ngedwa.
He cannot sit or walk.	Akakwazi ukuhlala noma ukuhamba.
He thinks nothing of it.	Akacabangi lutho.
It's really hard to say what happened.	Kunzima ngempela ukusho ukuthi kwenzekeni.
That's your shirt.	Ihembe lakho lelo.
This can be helpful.	Lokhu kungaba usizo.
I could not tell anyone.	Angikwazanga ukutshela muntu.
Down on the floor, he says.	Phansi phansi, usho.
He may walk slowly.	Angase ahambe kancane.
It's not just you.	Awuyena nje wena.
Even early.	Ngisho kusenesikhathi.
In one way only.	Ngendlela eyodwa kuphela.
He was going to be the one.	Wayezoba nguye lowo.
No, not man.	Cha, hhayi umuntu.
I will not say anywhere.	Ngeke ngisho ndawo.
Everyone is doing your job.	Wonke umuntu wenza umsebenzi wakho.
He would probably like to see pictures.	Cishe angathanda ukubona izithombe.
I can't wait to try this !!!!.	Angisakwazi ukulinda ukuzama lokhu!!!!.
He wanted to make his life easier again.	Wayefuna enze ukuphila kwakhe kube lula futhi.
What, he was not sure.	Yini, wayengenaso isiqiniseko.
Right now it looks like this.	Njengamanje kubukeka kanje.
He did not know that this would be so.	Wayengazi ukuthi kungaba kanje.
When you are human.	Lapho ungumuntu .
Let's build more.	Ake sakhe okwengeziwe.
And not just his clothes, but also the floor.	Futhi hhayi izingubo zakhe kuphela, kodwa futhi phansi.
Here I am, with you, it all happened.	Ngilapha, nawe, konke kwenzeke.
He said the same thing.	Usho into efanayo.
You would not even think about it.	Ubungeke ngisho ucabange ngakho.
Maybe a dog or a cat.	Mhlawumbe inja noma ikati.
He's asleep now, yes.	Ulele manje, yebo.
But again, it really is not necessary.	Kodwa futhi, empeleni akudingekile.
That's too much.	Kuningi kakhulu lokho.
Dinner, just the two of us.	Isidlo sakusihlwa, sobabili nje.
But he is not sure what is missing.	Kodwa akanaso isiqiniseko sokuthi yini engekho.
And the teacher.	Futhi uthisha.
He did not have to look for another permit.	Kwakungadingeki afune enye imvume.
He did not even tell me where he was.	Akazange angitshele nokuthi kuphi.
Currently, none.	Njengamanje, akukho.
I want it out.	Ngifuna ngaphandle.
And, yes, you expect the most from him.	Futhi, yebo, ulindele okukhulu kakhulu kuye.
There is nothing else to drink.	Akukho okunye okufanele ukuphuza.
Play hard to find.	Ukudlala kanzima ukuthola.
He will not tell anyone anything.	Ngeke atshele muntu lutho.
So my question is.	Ngakho umbuzo wami uthi.
Because really, it is.	Ngoba ngempela, kunjalo.
And to do the right thing.	Futhi ukwenza into efanele.
He can do this to me.	Angakwenza lokhu kimi.
But he could not do that.	Kodwa akakwazanga ukukwenza lokho .
We all know what happens, of course.	Sonke siyazi ukuthi kwenzekani, kunjalo.
My question is how did this happen.	Umbuzo wami uthi kwenzeka kanjani lokhu.
All the time, almost everything.	Ngaso sonke isikhathi, cishe yonke into.
But it is not a hope.	Kodwa akulona ithemba.
I would really like you up close.	Ngingathanda ngempela wena eduze.
Maybe even better.	Mhlawumbe kuhle ngisho.
That is not a dog.	Akuyona inja leyo.
Well, really good.	Kuhle, kuhle ngempela.
I'm always glad to see you.	Ngihlala ngijabule ukukubona.
You will not always know.	Ngeke ukwazi njalo.
Either way he has to do something.	Noma iyiphi indlela kufanele enze okuthile.
Your mom just wants a phone call.	Umama wakho ufuna nje ucingo.
This should not be too difficult to do.	Lokhu akufanele kube nzima kakhulu ukukwenza.

Life can be very difficult.	Ukuphila kungaba nzima kakhulu.

I mean, it can happen now.	Ngisho, kungenzeka manje.
But no, that would be too easy.	Kodwa cha, lokho kungaba lula kakhulu.
I do not know how? 	Angazi kanjani?
Always true.	Iqiniso njalo.
And he is not a very good person.	Futhi akuyena umuntu omuhle kakhulu.
You can’t be much better than that.	Awukwazi ukuba ngcono kakhulu kunalokho.
He wanted to make sure absolutely.	Wayefuna ukwenza isiqiniseko ngokuphelele.
He refused to do it.	Wenqaba ukukwenza.
Really cycling.	Ngempela ukugibela ibhayisikili.
Many hours, a lot of coffee.	Amahora amaningi, ikhofi eningi.
Maybe just like that.	Mhlawumbe kanjalo nje.
He refused.	Wenqaba yena.

Mom just sits there all day.	Umama uhlezi nje usuku lonke.
But nothing to come.	Kodwa lutho ukuza.
I know nothing about this.	Angazi lutho kulokhu.
In the meantime, choosing can be easy.	Okwamanje, ukukhetha kungaba lula.

You need to do that.	Udinga ukwenza lokho.
There is a problem here.	Kukhona inkinga lapha.
He must always speak the truth.	Kumele akhulume iqiniso ngaso sonke isikhathi.

Bad thing sometimes.	Into embi ngezinye izikhathi.

It's just hard to do.	Kunzima nje ukukwenza.
Or not, in this case.	Noma cha, kulokhu.
He has no time.	Akanaso isikhathi.
At the table, perhaps.	Etafuleni, mhlawumbe.
It is good to talk about it.	Kuhle ukukhuluma ngakho.
Yes, it can be so easy.	Yebo, kungase kube lula kanjalo.
Learning to play the piano.	Ukufunda ukudlala upiyano.

You also do not want to waste time.	Nawe awufuni ukuchitha isikhathi.
He is a person who wants to do everything right.	Ungumuntu ofuna ukwenza yonke into ngendlela efanele.
There is danger everywhere.	Kukhona ingozi yonke indawo.
That's all wrong.	Yilokho konke okubi.
He tried the key but to no avail.	Wazama ukhiye kodwa lutho.
But I am not a bad person here.	Kodwa angiyena umuntu omubi lapha.
Just in case .	Uma kwenzeka nje .
We may be alone for now.	Kungenzeka sibe sodwa okwamanje.

It is neither a thing nor a fact.	Akuyona into noma iqiniso.
He said last night.	Uthe ebusuku.
This would be a good idea too.	Lokhu kungaba umqondo omuhle futhi.

He wanted money from her.	Wayefuna imali kuye.
On time !.	Ngesikhathi!.
You have to be there.	Kufanele ube khona.
It is difficult to say why.	Kunzima ukusho ukuthi kungani.
I think that is your answer.	Ngicabanga ukuthi impendulo yakho leyo.
I thought of the water.	Ngacabanga amanzi.
Instead yesterday afternoon.	Kunalokho izolo ntambama.
So he just is.	Ngakho nguye nje.
Hopefully he will be back next year.	Ngethemba ukuthi uzobuya ngonyaka ozayo.

This will not be a sound.	Lokhu ngeke kube umsindo.
Everyone at the table knew it was true.	Wonke umuntu etafuleni wayazi ukuthi kunjalo.
It just has to.	Kufanele nje .
We too can only be an opinion.	Nathi kungaba umbono kuphela.
All life.	Ukuphila konke.
Why it all had to be so hard.	Kungani konke kwadingeka kube nzima kangaka.
You know how you think.	Uyazi ukuthi ucabanga kanjani.

It's not music.	Akuwona umculo.
Not as you think.	Hhayi njengoba ucabanga.
I just need to keep going.	Ngidinga nje ukuqhubeka nakho.
He got his idea.	Wathola umbono wakhe.

Almost everything.	Cishe kukho konke.
As long as this is true, nothing happens.	Uma nje lokhu kuyiqiniso, akukho okwenzekayo.
Not so, it's better.	Hhayi kanjalo, kungcono.
You cannot walk alone.	Awukwazi ukuhamba wedwa.
And so on and so forth.	Njalo, njalo njalo.
She looks happy enough.	Ubonakala ejabule ngokwanele.
Maybe he should stay for a while at school.	Mhlawumbe kufanele ahlale isikhashana esikoleni.

Absolutely nothing happens.	Nakanjani akukho okwenzekayo.
Immediately at this time.	Ngokushesha ngalesi sikhathi.
It’s not really a thing, though.	Akuyona into ngempela, noma kunjalo.
He is not a spirit.	Akayena umoya.
But sometimes it will not.	Kodwa ngezinye izikhathi ngeke.
I want to say that.	Ngifuna ukusho lokho.
No image.	Asikho isithombe.
He is also human.	Ungumuntu futhi.
Only if he wants to.	Kuphela uma efuna.
But none of this is happening.	Kodwa akukho kulokhu okwenzekayo.
At least, just a few days.	Okungenani, izinsuku ezimbalwa nje.
Better, but not too big.	Kungcono, kodwa hhayi okukhulu.
One book.	Incwadi eyodwa.
But maybe just me and you tonight.	Kodwa mhlawumbe yimi nawe nje kusihlwa.
My bad friend didn't help.	Umngane wami omubi akazange asize.
Not just death, no.	Hhayi nje ukufa, cha.
I didn't want to at all.	Ngangingafuni nhlobo.
Hard to say, I don't know.	Kunzima ukusho, angazi.

You walked this path before you were all alone.	Uhambe le ndlela ngaphambi kwakho konke uwedwa.
He never made a noise.	Akakaze enze umsindo.
I'm not sure which way is best for me.	Angiqiniseki ukuthi iyiphi indlela engcono kakhulu kimi.

You sit in your back seat.	Uhlala esiteshini sakho ngemuva.
Tomorrow, you will do something.	Kusasa, uzokwenza okuthile.
He should never know about that.	Akufanele neze azi ngalokho.
Right now he says.	Njengamanje uthi.
Everyone needs their own spirit.	Wonke umuntu udinga umoya wakhe.
And maybe he did, but not at first.	Futhi mhlawumbe wakwenza, kodwa hhayi ekuqaleni.

But we got more time there.	Kodwa sithole isikhathi esengeziwe lapho.
At our party.	Ephathini yethu.
I can't think or see right now.	Angikwazi ukucabanga noma ukubona njengamanje.
But not for long.	Kodwa akekho isikhathi eside.
It’s hard, sometimes.	Kunzima, ngezinye izikhathi.
You did not receive help.	Awuzange uthole usizo.
And one more thing, too.	Futhi enye into, futhi.
In our bed.	Embhedeni wethu.
And yes, we want something now.	Futhi yebo, sifuna okuthile manje.

He did not want to hear the answer.	Wayengafuni ukuzwa impendulo.
But the vision now.	Kodwa umbono manje.
That is not true everywhere.	Lokho akulona iqiniso yonke indawo.
Almost everyone did.	Cishe wonke umuntu wakwenza.
He would like to know the truth.	Angathanda ukwazi iqiniso.
I came here for us.	Ngize lapha kithi.
It is very good to know that.	Kuhle kakhulu ukwazi lokho.

If he has to, he can too.	Uma kufanele, angakwazi futhi.
It's just that no one is great.	Ukuthi nje akekho omkhulu.
I will be a car.	Ngizoba imoto.
It would be really nice to go there.	Kungaba kuhle ngempela ukuya lapho.

Not so my parents.	Akunjalo abazali bami.
You already know why.	Uyazi kakade ukuthi kungani.
Here, it will not.	Lapha, ngeke.

None of this really happened.	Akukho kulokhu okwenzeka ngempela .
It sounds that way too.	Kuzwakala kanjalo futhi.
I really like some of you.	Ngithanda kakhulu okunye kwakho.
I did not want that to happen.	Ngangingafuni ukuthi kwenzeke lokho.
Or you are doing very well.	Noma wenza kahle kakhulu.

And you don't know which one.	Futhi awazi ukuthi iyiphi.

You will not be able to finish him off.	Ngeke ukwazi ukuqeda ngaye.
It can be easy to stay for weeks.	Kungaba lula ukuhlala amasonto.
I want him to know what he did.	Ngifuna azi ukuthi wenzeni.
Maybe I was stupid.	Mhlawumbe ngibe isilima.
I can't sleep at night.	Angikwazi ukulala ebusuku.
Everyone feels absent.	Wonke umuntu uzizwa engekho.
And maybe yes.	Futhi mhlawumbe yebo.
Too much happens at once.	Kuningi kakhulu okwenzeka ngesikhathi esisodwa.
You need to see this.	Udinga ukubona lokhu.
You just need to try.	Udinga nje ukuzama.
You do that well.	Ukwenza kahle lokho.
I do not understand how to do it.	Angiqondi ukuthi ukwenza kanjani.
In the end it is true.	Ekugcineni kuyiqiniso.
You thought the same way.	Nawe wacabanga ngendlela efanayo.
I've never heard of it.	Angikaze ngizwe kuthiwa kuphi.
I knew exactly how she must have felt.	Ngangazi kahle ukuthi kumelwe ukuba uzizwa kanjani.
I want everyone there.	Ngifuna wonke umuntu lapho.
And what else? 	Futhi yini enye?
Maybe in a few years.	Mhlawumbe eminyakeni embalwa.
But in the end it will be better for him.	Kodwa ekugcineni kuzoba ngcono kuye.
And the only reason.	Futhi isizathu kuphela.
And in fact that is not always a bad thing.	Futhi empeleni lokho akuyona into embi ngaso sonke isikhathi.
No, never, never.	Cha, neze, neze.
I'm not sure when it happened.	Angazi kahle ukuthi kwenzeka nini.
I will do this perfectly.	Ngizokwenza lokhu ngokuphelele.
Your location please.	Indawo yakho ngicela.
I found this out recently.	Ngithole lokhu muva nje.
He could not take the gift now.	Akakwazanga ukuthatha isipho manje.
Like you never came.	Sengathi awukaze ufike.
And you better go.	Futhi kungcono uhambe.
But we can't stay here.	Kodwa asikwazi ukuhlala lapha.
Bad thing, if you think about it.	Into embi, uma ucabanga ngakho.
Yes, down to the top or up to the bottom.	Yebo, phansi kuye phezulu noma phezulu kuye phansi.
Or later in the night.	Noma kamuva ebusuku.
I feel good .	Ngizizwa kahle .
We need this time.	Sidinga isikhathi lesi.
What that could be, he knew nothing.	Ukuthi kungaba yini lokho, wayengazi lutho.
So do I.	Kanjalo nami.
He knows what happened to him.	Uyazi ukuthi kwenzekani kuye.
You know we need to move soon.	Uyazi ukuthi sidinga ukuhamba maduze.
You are trying to make a decision.	Uzama ukwenza isinqumo.
I found someone else.	Ngithole omunye umuntu.
I wanted him to leave.	Bengifuna ukuthi ahambe.
He can just.	Angakwazi nje .
No, it really isn't.	Cha, akufanele ngempela.
And something.	Futhi into.
He looked better.	Wayebukeka engcono.
I had to see another book.	Kwadingeka ngibone enye incwadi.
I think of you.	Ngicabanga wena.
Probably the whole family.	Mhlawumbe umndeni wonke.
He could not help her.	Wayengeke amsize.
He may try to buy out time.	Angase azame ukuthenga isikhathi.
You need to know all of this.	Kumele ukwazi konke lokhu.
He had to stay in the house.	Bekumele ahlale endlini.
Everything in the room.	Yonke into ekamelweni.
He never mentioned her at all.	Akakaze akhulume ngaye nhlobo.
I know now why.	Ngiyazi manje ukuthi kungani.
Of course, it is very difficult to do this.	Kunjalo, kunzima kakhulu ukwenza lokhu.
Just for your work.	Ngomsebenzi wakho nje.
That is not his fault.	Akulona iphutha lakhe lelo.
That may be one reason.	Lokho kungase kube isizathu esisodwa.
Let me tell you the truth.	Ake ngikhulume iqiniso.
This is my place in the world.	Lena indawo yami emhlabeni.
Everyone is scared, but no one knows what to do.	Wonke umuntu uyesaba, kodwa akekho owaziyo ukuthi enzeni.
I got a bike.	Ngithole ibhayisikili.
This is not his thing.	Akuyona into yakhe lena.
I want a family, my children.	Ngifuna umndeni, izingane zami.
He took.	Wathatha .
I have to get to my party.	Kumele ngifike emcimbini wami.
He never said anything to me.	Akakaze asho lutho kimi.
Obviously there is something.	Ngokusobala kukhona okuthile.
I'm sorry to see you like this.	Ngiyaxolisa ukukubona kanje.
Only a few days.	Izinsuku ezimbalwa kuphela.
Friend or not.	Umngane noma cha.
And, again, no.	Futhi, futhi, cha.
And definitely alone.	Futhi nakanjani wedwa.
He will come and live with my family.	Uzofika uzohlala nomndeni wami.
I have never heard of anyone there.	Angikaze ngizwe kuthiwa kukhona umuntu lapho.
I don't know where he can be.	Angazi ukuthi angaba kuphi.
He just wanted to hear from her.	Wayefuna nje ukuzwa kuye.
It will be good for both of us.	Kuzoba kuhle kithi sobabili.
Yes, it is not your fault.	Yebo, akulona iphutha lakho.
It happened years ago.	Kwenzeka eminyakeni edlule.
He asked his mother instead.	Wabuza umama wakhe esikhundleni.
Dad found out.	Ubaba wathola.
That’s why you need to go.	Yingakho udinga ukuhamba.
To get the right amount of money, of course.	Ukuze uthole imali efanele, kunjalo.
I am always excited to try something new.	Ngihlale ngijabule ukuzama into entsha.
Eventually he died for it.	Ekugcineni washona ngakho.
I did something else.	Ngenze okunye.
Also, there is no restraint.	Futhi, akukho ukuzibamba.
He thought he was playing with her.	Wayecabanga ukuthi udlala naye.
No food on the floor.	Akukho ukudla phansi.
My mother tried.	Umama wazama.
So maybe just lunch.	Ngakho mhlawumbe isidlo sasemini nje.
I don't want him to be my doctor.	Angifuni abe udokotela wami.
You seem to have the ability to do that.	Ubonakala unekhono lokwenza lokho.
I think he would like to.	Ngicabanga ukuthi angathanda.
Either way should.	Noma iyiphi indlela kufanele.
He didn't know how he knew, but he knew.	Wayengazi ukuthi wayazi kanjani, kodwa wakwazi.
I try to cry.	Ngizama ukukhala.
I had to wait again.	Kwadingeka ngilinde futhi.
He would not sit down like this.	Wayengeke ahlale phansi kanje.
Or almost nothing.	Noma cishe lutho.
He says it's his fault.	Uthi iphutha lakhe.
You never told me about him.	Awukaze ungitshele ngaye.
I wish you could.	Ngifisa sengathi ungakwazi.
He loves children.	Uthanda izingane.
I think this is obvious.	Ngicabanga ukuthi lokhu kusobala.
You know very well that it is not true.	Uyazi kahle ukuthi akulona iqiniso.
I have to be really better.	Kufanele ngibe ngcono ngempela.
It has been good so far.	Kube kuhle kuze kube manje.
My father never mentioned him.	Ubaba akakaze akhulume ngaye.
Or maybe yes.	Noma mhlawumbe yebo.
But even this is not always the case.	Kodwa ngisho nalokhu akulona iqiniso ngaso sonke isikhathi.
He looked around the room.	Wabheka ekamelweni.
I want to fix some things.	Ngifuna ukulungisa ezinye izinto.
We both know now.	Sobabili siyazi manje.
But to make time.	Kodwa ukwenza isikhathi.
He happens to be living in my house.	Kwenzeka ukuthi ehlala endlini yami.
But it is good for you.	Kodwa kuhle kuwe.
And you are already there.	Futhi usevele ukhona.
So you can do that instead.	Ngakho ungakwenza lokho esikhundleni.
And he was not sure why.	Futhi wayengenaso isiqiniseko sokuthi kungani.
But it is not his fault.	Kodwa akulona iphutha lakhe.
You really can't see it.	Empeleni awukwazi ukukubona.
Her father will have to help her anyway.	Ubaba wakhe kuzomele amsize kunjalo.
I hope you come today.	Ngethemba ukuthi uzofika namuhla.
He heard someone behind him.	Wezwa omunye ngemuva kwakhe.
I have to speak fast.	Kufanele ngikhulume ngokushesha.
Probably why.	Kungenzeka ukuthi kungani.
But you do not have to go there.	Kodwa awudingi ukuya kukho.
Not many people.	Hhayi abantu abaningi.
I thought, it 's going to have to be someone else now.	Ngacabanga, kuzofanele kube omunye umuntu manje.
You are going somewhere.	Uya ndawo.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Ayikho into embi kabi.
Or even friends said.	Noma ngisho abangani wathi.
But that is not the story.	Kodwa lokho akuyona indaba.
She is very happy too.	Ujabule kakhulu futhi.
I have never been a father.	Angikaze ngibe ubaba.
So, we have to find out more.	Ngakho, kufanele sithole okwengeziwe.
Instead, one thought.	Kunalokho, omunye wacabanga.
We know what is best.	Siyazi ukuthi yini engcono kakhulu.
We can't find anything here.	Asikwazi ukuthola lutho lapha.
That could be me.	Lokho kungaba yimi.
Nothing bad happened.	Akukho okwenzekile okubi.
She did not know what she looked like.	Wayengazi ukuthi ubukeka kanjani.
You are not going anywhere.	Akukho lapho uya khona.
I wanted a gun.	Ngangifuna isibhamu.
But he knew he had to.	Kodwa wayazi ukuthi kufanele.
No new baby.	Ayikho ingane entsha.
Whatever happens, I am not alone.	Kwenzeka noma yini, akumina ngedwa.
No reason it happened to me.	Akukho kungani kwenzeka kimi.
So, you are saying something else.	Ngakho, ukhuluma enye into.
I need my time with me.	Ngidinga isikhathi sami nami.
I live in a car.	Ngihlala emotweni.
Not to live at all.	Hhayi ukuphila ngokuphelele.
I thought about getting a new job.	Ngacabanga ukuthola umsebenzi omusha.
I like to say three things.	Ngithanda ukusho izinto ezintathu.
And my father never wanted to talk about it.	Futhi ubaba wayengafuni neze ukukhuluma ngakho.
Later everyone wondered why.	Kamuva wonke umuntu wazibuza ukuthi kungani.
I wanted a voice.	Bengifuna izwi.
He has to stay in bed to make sure.	Kumele ahlale embhedeni ukuze enze isiqiniseko.
I wonder if it could be.	Kazi kungaba njalo.
He should not help.	Akufanele asize.
I've really been thinking about this for a long time.	Impela kade ngicabanga ngalokhu.
This is not such a book.	Lena akuyona incwadi enjalo.
He knew very well.	Wayazi kahle kakhulu.
Nothing bad happened to me.	Akukho okubi kakhulu okwenzeka kimi.
I can't take any risk.	Angikwazi ukuthatha noma iyiphi ingozi.
He never wants to come to our place.	Akafuni neze ukuza endaweni yethu.
He saw a nice restaurant and went in.	Wabona indawo yokudlela enhle wangena.
He accompanies me almost everywhere.	Uhamba nami cishe yonke indawo.
I did not think so.	Ngangingacabangi kanjalo.
It looks like a sack that encloses with a drawstring.	Kubukeka sengathi ulele nje.
He is not either.	Akayena futhi.
This is not a new idea for me.	Lokhu akuwona umbono omusha kimi.
And maybe not much in between.	Futhi mhlawumbe akukho okuningi phakathi.
We just need to go.	Sidinga nje ukuhamba.
My friend did what he did because he was scared.	Umngane wami wenza akwenzile ngoba wayesaba.
Because you learn a lot.	Ngoba ufunda okuningi.
Our family.	Umndeni wethu.
No, not at all.	Cha, ngisho.
It never was.	Awukaze ube njalo .
Not if it should have been.	Cha uma bekungafanele.
Really good, actually.	Kuhle ngempela, empeleni.
This is just another option.	Lena enye indlela nje.
The question is.	Umbuzo uthi .
Better than you, maybe.	Kungcono kunawe, mhlawumbe.
only me.	mina kuphela .
A little more than you want to do.	Kancane kunalokho ofuna ukukwenza.
I had to go with him.	Bekumele ngihambe naye.
Yes, that will not happen.	Yebo, ngeke kwenzeke lokho.
You got the idea.	Uthole umqondo.
Now, that's right, he knew.	Manje, kunjalo, wayazi.
A little kid, actually.	Ingane encane, empeleni.
And he looks very good.	Futhi ubukeka kahle kakhulu.
How to make his way on earth.	Indlela yokwenza indlela yakhe emhlabeni.
But sometimes it has to be done.	Kodwa ngezinye izikhathi kufanele kwenziwe.
Like you, 'he says.	Njengawe,' usho kanje.
I have always wanted to tell you.	Kade ngifisa ukukutshela.
I don't even have one.	Anginayo ngisho eyodwa.
What to wear.	Okufanele ugqoke.
What’s better.	Yini engcono kakhulu.
She was going to him.	Kade eya kuye.
And you will be here.	Futhi uzoba lapha.
Not if or yet.	Hhayi uma noma kodwa.
Very, very early.	Kakhulu, ngaphambili kakhulu.
I think he is also a teacher now.	Ngicabanga ukuthi naye unguthisha manje.
You are not a spirit.	Awuyena umoya.
I hope not, but it can be.	Ngethemba ukuthi ngeke, kodwa kungaba njalo.
And it came to pass,.	Futhi kwenzeka, .
I am very happy to read here again.	Ngijabule kakhulu ukufunda lapha futhi.
Just that, anything else.	Lokho nje, noma yini enye.
He saw that it was time to leave.	Wabona sekuyisikhathi sokuthi ahambe.
I want everything done right.	Ngifuna ukuthi konke kwenziwe ngendlela efanele.
This seems right to me.	Lokhu kubonakala kulungile kimi.
But it's not me.	Kodwa akumina.
Right now, he's talking to me.	Njengamanje, ukhuluma nami.
It all looks like that to me.	Konke kubukeka kanjalo kimi.
Yet it seems at the moment.	Noma kunjalo kubonakala ngaleso sikhathi.
And it is not really our problem.	Futhi akuyona inkinga yethu ngempela.
And, yes, he can't.	Futhi, yebo, akakwazi.
Once a month.	Njalo kanye ngenyanga.
And now at school.	Futhi manje esikoleni.
He didn't know why, really, but he knew.	Wayengazi ukuthi kungani, ngempela, kodwa wayazi.
So he thought again with her.	Ngakho wacabanga kabusha naye.
We know that happens.	Siyazi ukuthi lokho kwenzeka.
He was wearing his clothes.	Wayegqoke izingubo zakhe.
Such a beautiful place too.	Indawo enhle enjalo futhi.
You need to eat.	Udinga ukuthi adle.
What is your problem.	Yini inkinga yakho.
He sat up in bed and quickly looked down.	Wahlala embhedeni ngokushesha wabheka phansi.
Nothing bad happened to him there.	Akukho okubi okwenzeka kuye lapho.
I came to talk to you.	ngize ukukhuluma nawe.
Indeed, advice.	Ngempela, iseluleko .
I want to tell you, last weekend, but there is no time.	Ngifuna ukukutshela, ngempelasonto edlule, kodwa asikho isikhathi.
But first, it seems, we need to find his friends.	Kodwa okokuqala, kubonakala, sidinga ukuthola abangane bakhe.
We want the same thing.	Sifuna into efanayo.
He won't be back in a few hours.	Ngeke abuye amahora ambalwa.
I wanted one.	Bengifuna eyodwa.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Akukho okufanele lokho.
I don't know if I will do it.	Angazi noma ngizokwenza.
No one up.	Akukho muntu phezulu.
We know it isn't now.	Siyazi ukuthi akusona manje.
And, little by little.	Futhi, kancane kancane.
I didn't know what to do, how to do it.	Ngangingazi ukuthi ngenzeni, ngenze kanjani.
This is possible, but difficult.	Lokhu kungenzeka, kodwa kunzima.
I need food all the time.	Ngidinga ukudla ngaso sonke isikhathi.
It could all be a lie.	Konke kungaba amanga.
I tried to walk closer to her.	Ngazama ukuhamba eduze kwakhe.
But that's just fine.	Kodwa lokho kuhle nje.
And he went out of the room.	Futhi waphuma ekamelweni.
Eating for life.	Ukudla impilo yonke.
I wanted to be a doctor.	Ngangifuna ukuba udokotela.
If this is true, he should go.	Uma lokhu kuyiqiniso, kufanele ahambe.
Now, anyone can do it.	Manje, noma ubani angakwenza.

As he actually did.	Njengoba empeleni enza.
You go home if you like.	Uya ekhaya uma uthanda.
And yes it is.	Futhi yebo kunjalo.
Maybe it would have been better if.	Mhlawumbe ngabe kungcono ukube .
Very, very, very bad.	Kakhulu, kakhulu, kabi kakhulu.
So, it happens in our world.	Ngakho, kwenzeka emhlabeni wethu.
It is very difficult, but possible.	Kunzima impela, kodwa kungenzeka.
I know we will never be together.	Ngiyazi ngeke sibe ndawonye.
I would not be able to find that.	Bengingeke ngikwazi ukuthola lokho.
A little something about me.	Into encane ngami.
He did not know how he felt.	Wayengazi ukuthi uzizwa kanjani.
You’re actually playing next to me soon.	Empeleni udlala eduze kwami ​​maduze nje.
That's my new thing.	Into yami entsha leyo.
Let me repeat here.	Ake ngiphinde ngiphinde lapha.

And he has to be, too.	Futhi kufanele abe njalo, futhi.
It will take about.	Kuzothatha cishe.
Or last year.	Noma ngonyaka odlule.
Good response.	Impendulo enhle.
Do it now.	Ukwenza manje.

As you never knew.	Njengoba awukaze wazi.
But first, a good thing.	Kodwa okokuqala, into enhle.

Anything can happen now.	Kungenzeka noma yini manje.
It's hard here.	Kunzima lapha.
More in the background.	Okuningi ngemuva.
This morning.	Le ekuseni.
Not too much.	Akekho kakhulu.
Yes, my mother died.	Yebo, umama washona.
He knew something about her, too.	Wayazi okuthile ngaye, futhi.
But only her parents.	Kodwa abazali bakhe kuphela.
Always the same thing.	Njalo into efanayo.
And three no.	Futhi ezintathu cha.
Her teacher is her father.	Uthisha wakhe ubaba wakhe.
I'm glad it's not, you know, another house.	Ngiyajabula ukuthi akuyona, uyazi, enye indlu.
You know how to do it right.	Uyazi ukwenza kahle lokhu.
Most of the time, you do the same.	Isikhathi esiningi, nawe wenza kanjalo.

You are really happy about it.	Impela ujabule ngakho.
I don't want to do it again.	angifuni ukukwenza futhi.
You should stay for a week.	Kufanele uhlale isonto lonke.

Everyone will know except me.	Wonke umuntu uzokwazi ngaphandle kwami.
I have made a beautiful house.	Ngenze indlu enhle.
I want to try everything.	Ngifuna ukuzama konke.
I wanted to hear something again.	Ngangifuna ukuzwa okuthile futhi.
Drinking beer, yes.	Ukuphuza ubhiya, yebo.
The boy agreed.	Wavuma umfana.
He refused to give up.	Wenqaba ukuyeka.
But it sounds good right now.	Kodwa kuzwakala kahle okwamanje.
She is happy to be coming.	Uyajabula uyeza.
It has almost always been better.	Cishe njalo kube ngcono.
He needed to do more.	Kwakudingeka enze okwengeziwe.
Or to be difficult.	Noma ukuba nzima.
How can this be.	Kungenzeka kanjani lokhu .
And he knew so much about her.	Futhi wayazi okuningi kakhulu ngaye.

No food or anything here.	Akukho ukudla noma lutho lapha.
He cannot and should not be.	Akakwazi futhi akufanele abe.
I feel in my home.	Ngizwa ekhaya lami.
He should not have come.	Bekungafanele eze.
This is not for you.	Lokhu akukho kuwe.
I was not happy there.	Angizange ngijabule lapho.
Yes, he knows all about it.	Yebo, wazi konke ngalokho.
It will just happen.	Kuzokwenzeka nje.
I got to him first.	Ngifike kuye kuqala.
Getting there will not be easy, but you can do it.	Ukufika lapho ngeke kube lula, kodwa ungakwenza.
As he does every day.	Njengoba enza nsuku zonke.
This is the picture.	Lesi isithombe.
He has to leave immediately.	Kuzomele ahambe ngokushesha.
But again, this is not true.	Kodwa futhi, lokhu akulona iqiniso.
Anyway I just wanted to talk about that.	Noma kunjalo nje bengifuna ukukhuluma ngalokho.
He just wanted to be your friend.	Wayefuna ukuba umngane wakho kuphela.
I'll go with that.	Ngizohamba nalokho.
To save your time.	Ukuze ugcine isikhathi sakho.
He works hard for it.	Usebenza kanzima ngakho.
I'm not sure it's possible.	Angiqiniseki ukuthi kungenzeka.
Finally out.	Ekugcineni ukuphuma.
That's not his way, right now.	Akuyona indlela yakhe, njengamanje.
Think of another good idea.	Ucabange omunye umbono omuhle.
I wonder if it was today.	Kazi ngabe namuhla.
Eventually he returned to work.	Ekugcineni wabuyela emsebenzini.
I don't think it should.	Angicabangi ukuthi kufanele.
We will need to get a call.	Kuzodingeka sithole ucingo.
I can't do my homework.	Angikwazi ukwenza umsebenzi wami wesikole.
We did not have time.	Asizange sibe nesikhathi.
He came to you first.	Weza kuwe kuqala.
Without you you would be nothing.	Ngaphandle kwakho ubengeke abe lutho.
Don't forget my name, too.	Ungakhohlwa igama lami, futhi.
Stop working.	Yeka ukusebenza.
So something had to be done.	Ngakho kwakufanele kwenziwe okuthile.
Almost everything.	Cishe konke.
You want to know what's coming.	Uthanda ukwazi ukuthi yini ezayo.
And you have to go.	Futhi kufanele uhambe.
He must know.	Kumele akwazi.
So this had to happen.	Ngakho lokhu kwakufanele kwenzeke.
Not now, but soon.	Hhayi manje, kodwa maduze.
All that much.	Konke lokho okuningi.
Or like me.	Noma njengami.
It is not a thing either.	Akuyona into noma.
I'm sorry, but I can't.	Ngiyaxolisa, kodwa ngeke.
Not time or place.	Hhayi isikhathi noma indawo.
He could not wait for the police.	Akakwazanga ukulinda amaphoyisa.
He didn't know what it would be, if any, that.	Wayengazi ukuthi kungaba yini, uma kukhona, lokho.
Tell me another one.	Ngitshele enye.
It must be difficult to go that way.	Kumelwe kube nzima ukuhamba kanjalo.
Not a few days.	Hhayi izinsuku ezimbalwa.
He did not see what was in it.	Akazange abone ukuthi yini phakathi.
You have become a good friend.	Ube umngane omuhle.
I know about that.	Ngiyazi ngalokho.
Dad asked if he could play.	Ubaba wabuza ukuthi angakwazi yini ukudlala.
This is just a one-off stay.	Lokhu ukuhlala kanye nje.
Not all, not much, but some.	Hhayi konke, hhayi okuningi, kodwa okunye.
That, or money.	Lokho, noma imali.
He can speak when he is not there.	Uyakwazi ukukhuluma lapho engekho.
I don't have it here.	Anginayo lapha.
Not easy, but still.	Hhayi kalula, kodwa noma kunjalo.
So everyone.	Ngakho wonke umuntu.
As the father is.	Njengoba ubaba enjalo.
And that's a risk.	Futhi lokho ingozi.
Now it looks like he is coming.	Manje kubukeka sengathi uzofika.
I want to do it the right way.	Ngifuna ukukwenza ngendlela efanele.
I need more pictures.	Ngidinga izithombe eziningi.
Maybe a little home.	Mhlawumbe ekhaya kancane.
It is very difficult to choose just one.	Kunzima kakhulu ukukhetha eyodwa kuphela.
And it will be true.	Futhi kuzoba iqiniso.
He has done almost everything else.	Wenze cishe konke okunye.
He did not come.	Akazange afike .
I found out recently.	Ngithole muva nje.
Well, maybe so.	Kulungile, mhlawumbe kunjalo.
He thought he could.	Wayecabanga ukuthi angakwazi.
But that is exactly what he did.	Kodwa yilokho kanye akwenza.
Everyone was afraid of the other.	Wonke umuntu wayesaba omunye.
I want to be here for her.	Ngifuna ukuba lapha ngenxa yakhe.
Because this is actually possible.	Ngoba lokhu empeleni kungenzeka.
Because everyone talks about everything.	Ngoba wonke umuntu ukhuluma ngayo yonke into.
He would like to know everything.	Angathanda ukwazi yonke into.
He did that now for her.	Wakwenza lokho manje kuye.
He was not always sure which one.	Wayengenaso isiqiniseko ngaso sonke isikhathi ukuthi iyiphi.
Yeah, you got here, all right.	Yebo, ufike lapha, kulungile.
But you can fix this problem quickly.	Kodwa ungakwazi ukulungisa le nkinga ngokushesha.
He was optimistic and happy about this.	Wayenethemba futhi ejabule ngalokhu.
Is it good ?.	Ingabe kuhle?.
Go right there.	Ukuhamba khona kanye.
I am very happy with the way this is happening.	Ngijabule kakhulu ngendlela lokhu okwenzeka ngayo.
He did not lie.	Akazange enze amanga.
There is something else.	Okunye kukho.
You can do that alone.	Uyakwazi ukwenza lokho uma uwedwa.
I knew it all by now.	Ngangazi konke manje.
But before he did.	Kodwa ngaphambi kokuba akwenze.
I was just thinking about that this morning.	Bengicabanga ngalokho nje ekuseni.
No one knows what happened to you.	Akekho owaziyo ukuthi kwenzekani kuwe.
I'm not sure you did.	Angiqiniseki ukuthi ukwenzile.
Absolutely! 	Impela!
But let me help you.	Kodwa ake ngisize.
I never went to class.	Angikaze ngiye ekilasini.
I just have to find out who she is.	Kumele nje ngithole ukuthi ubani.
Now it is not necessary.	Manje akudingekile.
We need someone.	Sidinga umuntu.
He wasn't in that.	Wayengekho kulokho.
He knew what to do.	Wayazi okufanele akwenze.
But he wanted to know everything.	Kodwa wayefuna ukwazi konke.
But a nice shirt.	Kodwa ihembe elihle.
It's just that everything happened so fast.	Ukuthi nje konke kwenzeke ngokushesha.
Sure, it could be anyone.	Impela, kungaba noma ubani.
And he is serious about it.	Futhi uzimisele ngakho.
Not today though.	Hhayi namuhla noma kunjalo.
Apparently, that is exactly what he did.	Ngokusobala, yilokho kanye akwenza.
Obviously so.	Kusobala kanjalo.
With him, that was not done.	Naye, lokho akuzange kwenziwe.
He knew how to do the job.	Wayazi indlela yokwenza umsebenzi.
Why should he be something else ?.	Kungani kufanele abe enye into?.
She looked very happy.	Wayebukeka ejabule kakhulu .
I don't want to hear what you have to say.	Angifuni ukuzwa ukuthi uthini.
There is no good answer.	Ayikho impendulo enhle.
Because maybe it will be helpful to me.	Ngoba mhlawumbe kuzoba usizo kimi.
He was afraid most of the time.	Wayesaba isikhathi esiningi.
Getting into school is as difficult as it gets.	Ukungena esikoleni kunzima njengoba kunjalo.
I feel very similarly.	Ngizizwa ngendlela efanayo kakhulu.
Before he left.	Ngaphambi kokuthi ahambe.
I would like to say that.	Ngingathanda ngisho lokho.
I could not get back there.	Angikwazanga ukubuyela lapho.
Football with me.	Ibhola kanye nami.
That does not mean at all.	Akusho neze lokho.
Almost nothing happens.	Cishe akukho okwenzekayo.
But one never really thought about it, you know.	Kodwa umuntu akazange acabange ngakho ngempela, uyazi.
She came and talked to him.	Wafika wakhuluma naye.
I can't do this now.	Angikwazi ukwenza lokhu manje.
That's the person.	Ungumuntu lowo.
I also knew why.	Ngangazi nokuthi kungani.
It can be but probably not.	Kungaba kodwa mhlawumbe ngeke.
But it is not just music.	Kodwa akuwona nje umculo.
Too much of it all.	Okuningi kakhulu kwakho konke.
First and foremost.	Okokuqala futhi kuye.
I would like to tell you more.	Ngingathanda ukukutshela okwengeziwe.
That sounds obvious.	Lokho kuzwakala kusobala.
Everyone wants to be a better person.	Wonke umuntu uthanda ukuba umuntu ongcono.
Not the father.	Hhayi ubaba.
Lots of lots of stuff.	Izinto eziningi eziningi.
This should be done regularly.	Lokhu kufanele kwenziwe njalo.
Really, I am very happy for him.	Ngempela, ngijabule kakhulu ngaye.
Something he can do in a car.	Okuthile angakwenza emotweni.
As it happens, no.	Njengoba kwenzeka, cha.
No, not something.	Cha, hhayi okuthile.
There is really no need.	Asikho ngempela isidingo.
So my friend was not there.	Ngakho umngane wami wayengekho.
I hope that.	Ngethemba ukuthi.
I will make questions.	Ngizokwenza imibuzo.
He was very thoughtful.	Wayecabanga kakhulu impela.
Not all the way, just a little bit.	Hhayi yonke indlela, kancane nje.
One should not do such a thing.	Umuntu akufanele enze into enjalo.
The voice.	Izwi .
But another problem for me.	Kodwa enye inkinga yami.
I didn't think much of it in the first place.	Angizange ngicabange kakhulu ngakho ekuqaleni.
Of course this is not always true.	Yebo lokhu akulona iqiniso ngaso sonke isikhathi.
It's hard for us to know right now.	Kunzima ngathi ukwazi njengamanje.
And you think of him.	Futhi ucabanga naye.
This is obvious to see.	Lokhu kusobala ukubona.
He will do it his way.	Uzokwenza ngendlela yakhe.
Probably not for long.	Mhlawumbe ngeke isikhathi eside.
He didn't think much of it so neither did he.	Wayengacabangi kakhulu ngakho kanjalo naye.
Very large house.	Indlu enkulu kakhulu.
To talk about it.	Ukuze akhulume ngakho.
So he lives alone.	Ngakho uhlala yedwa.
I would love to read that.	Ngingathanda ukufunda lokho.
I need help with everything.	Ngidinga usizo ngakho konke.
Not me.	Hhayi mina ngenzeni.
But that sounds good.	Kodwa kuzwakala kulungile.
You always knew his opinion.	Ubuwazi njalo umbono wakhe.
And he did it anyway.	Futhi ukwenzile noma kunjalo.
If he.	Uma yena .
Thus it is possible.	Kanjalo kungenzeka.
You will make sure that you know that.	Uzokwenza isiqiniseko sokuthi uyakwazi lokho.
Sometimes you can't.	Ngezinye izikhathi awukwazi.
We can't do that tonight.	Ngeke sikwenze lokho namuhla ebusuku.
One has to do something.	Umuntu kufanele enze okuthile.
We should have this now.	Kufanele sibe nalokhu manje.
I said the wrong thing.	Ngikhulume into engalungile.
Slow movement.	Ukuhamba kancane.
There is so much for everyone to do.	Kuningi wonke umuntu angakwenza.
That's his life.	Impilo yakhe leyo.
Or his eyes.	Noma amehlo akhe.
I have to come tonight now.	Kumele ngifike ebusuku manje.
He left early.	Uhambe kusenesikhathi.
Save your car.	Ugcine imoto yakho.
You can't do that to me.	Ngeke ukwenze lokho kimi.
Or a case.	Noma icala.
I'll be there soon.	Ngizoba lapho maduze.
Or is it.	Noma ingabe .
I'm happy, that's a big deal.	Ngijabule, into enkulu leyo.
And he wouldn't have that.	Futhi wayengeke abe nakho lokho.
Not what he did.	Hhayi lokho akwenza.
Money, problems.	Imali, izinkinga.
The big question is who.	Umbuzo omkhulu ukuthi ubani.
Something great, something.	Okuthile okukhulu, okuthile .
He just arrived.	Wafika nje.
It is good to know that.	Kuhle impela ukwazi lokho.
Not that you exist.	Hhayi ukuthi ukhona.
Maybe something else is happening.	Mhlawumbe kukhona okunye okwenzekayo.
Besides everything else.	Ngaphandle kwakho konke okunye.
Not up, really.	Hhayi phezulu, ngempela.
He later told me.	Kamuva wangitshela.
I want to know the truth about myself.	Ngifuna ukwazi iqiniso ngami.
We know how this happened.	Siyazi ukuthi lokhu kwenzeka kanjani.
It looks good too.	Kubukeka sengathi kuhle futhi.
He watched for as long as possible.	Wabuka isikhathi eside ngangokunokwenzeka.
I just couldn’t talk about it.	Angikwazanga nje ukukhuluma ngakho.
He must try hard to do this.	Kumele azame kanzima ukwenza lokhu.
But not just once.	Kodwa hhayi kanye nje.
But we both pretend to be.	Kodwa sobabili senza sengathi kunjalo.
He could not even say.	Akakwazanga ngisho.
It should be his spirit.	Kufanele ube umoya wakhe.
It does not matter how it happened.	Akusho lutho ukuthi kwenzeke kanjani.
This can happen very well anywhere.	Lokhu kungenzeka kakhulu noma kuphi.
Maybe it happened to you right now.	Mhlawumbe kwenzeka kuwe njengamanje.
He wanted more children.	Wayefuna izingane eziningi.
I can't be that person.	Angikwazi ukuba lowo muntu.
Don't do it, please don't do it.	Ungakwenzi, ngicela ungakwenzi.
But everything else is fine.	Kodwa konke okunye kulungile.
And good job.	Futhi umsebenzi omuhle.
Why it should be so, no one knows.	Kungani kufanele kube njalo, akekho owaziyo.
Really that good work.	Ngempela lowo msebenzi omuhle.
We do not always know that.	Asikwazi njalo lokho.
If, and sometimes.	Uma, futhi ngezinye izikhathi.
There is another way.	Kukhona futhi enye indlela.
This is not for everyone.	Lokhu akuwona wonke umuntu.
I hope you will come and stay again soon.	Ngethemba ukuthi uzofika futhi uhlale futhi maduze.
To make a mistake.	Ukuze wenze iphutha.
There had to be.	Bekufanele kube khona.
I don't really know how.	Angazi ngempela ukuthi kanjani.
There is no way he can.	Ayikho indlela angakwazi ngayo.
In his work, he could not survive.	Emsebenzini wakhe, wayengeke akwazi ukuphila.
It can be just about anything.	Kungaba noma yini nje.
He tried his best to pretend that he did not.	Wazama ngayo yonke indlela ukwenza sengathi ayikho.
You need help with it.	Udinga usizo kukho.
No other food or anything.	Akukho okunye ukudla noma yini.
Not a party.	Hhayi iphathi.
I think the name.	Ngicabanga igama.

The best thing now is to have my family.	Into engcono kakhulu manje ukuba nomndeni wami.
Everyone wants to help everyone.	Wonke umuntu ufuna ukusiza wonke umuntu.
We did it from the beginning.	Sikwenze kusukela ekuqaleni.
Years with him.	Iminyaka naye.
I want to make sure you know about it.	Ngifuna ukwenza isiqiniseko sokuthi uyazi ngakho.

He should be my friend.	Kufanele abe umngane wami.
But, not always.	Kodwa, hhayi njalo.
I'm going home tomorrow morning.	Ngiya ekhaya kusasa ekuseni kakhulu.
With him, you can not.	Naye, awukwazi.
It seems like everyone knows everyone except me.	Kubonakala sengathi wonke umuntu wazi wonke umuntu ngaphandle kwami.
That's almost.	Lokho cishe.
He could not sleep for long.	Akakwazanga ukulala isikhathi eside.
Dad money.	Ubaba imali.
And yes, that's fine.	Futhi yebo, kuhle.
You're a little better today.	Ungcono kancane namuhla.
Certainly, she is very beautiful.	Impela, muhle impela.

Anyone would like to be with him.	Noma ubani angathanda ukuba naye.
This, too, is true.	Lokhu, nakho, kuyiqiniso.
You can not find energy for anything.	Awukwazi ukuthola amandla lutho.
Today if possible.	Namuhla uma kungenzeka.
We made mistakes.	Senze amaphutha.
She wanted to go to her bed.	Wayefuna ukuya embhedeni wakhe.
You will be just another child.	Uzoba enye ingane nje.
Or maybe to me.	Noma mhlawumbe kimi.
You can go with it.	Ungakwazi ukuhamba ngayo.
Not a doctor.	Hhayi udokotela.
You can do that right now.	Ungakwenza lokho njengamanje.
You bought something.	Uthenge okuthile.
My father did so.	Ubaba wenza kanjalo.
There is that, too.	Kukhona lokho, futhi.
My mind must be playing tricks on me.	Umqondo wami kumele ngabe udlala ngami.
And, the spirit.	Futhi, umoya.
And he wanted nothing.	Futhi wayengafuni lutho.
But it is not really necessary.	Kodwa empeleni akudingekile.
You told me that last night.	Ungitshele lokho izolo ebusuku.
You can fix things.	Ungakwazi ukulungisa izinto.
At least not now.	Okungenani hhayi ngalesi sikhathi.
Or maybe he would have.	Noma mhlawumbe wayezoba nakho.
His gift.	Isipho sakhe.
All you have to do is log in again.	Okufanele ukwenze nje ukungena futhi.
But he would have known.	Kodwa ngabe wayazi.
You will not find anything about it.	Ngeke uthole lutho ngakho.
Now there is no need.	Manje asikho isidingo.
I can't ride.	Angikwazi ukugibela.
Nothing more.	Akukho okunye futhi.
He has to do well.	Kufanele enze kahle.
Finding my location.	Ukuthola indawo yami.
I can't tell you that.	Angikwazi ukukutshela lokho.
Obviously, nothing happened.	Ngokusobala, akuzange kwenzeke lutho.
He wanted to do things for her.	Wayefuna ukwenza izinto kuye.
It could be night now.	Kungenzeka ebusuku manje.
I just need to hear his voice.	Ngidinga nje ukuzwa izwi lakhe.
Looks like it won't happen now.	Kubukeka sengathi ngeke kwenzeke manje.
So no one knows.	Ngakho akekho owaziyo.
Error at work.	Iphutha emsebenzini.
It was nice to see.	Kube kuhle ukubona.
You probably know about that.	Kungenzeka ukuthi uyazi ngakho.

All there, but not there.	Konke lapho, kodwa hhayi lapho.
We want a good name.	Sifuna igama elihle.
Going to school every day.	Ukuya esikoleni nsuku zonke.
Not outside.	Akukho ngaphandle.
I must not say anything yet.	Akumele ngisho lutho okwamanje.
But that is not really the case.	Kodwa empeleni akuyona into enjalo.
I just want an answer.	Ngifuna impendulo nje.
Maybe you're just here to find out.	Mhlawumbe ulapha nje ngoba ufuna ukwazi.
Yes, that's right, three.	Yebo, kunjalo, ezintathu.
You should get one.	Kufanele uthole eyodwa.

You are talking to someone.	Ukhuluma umuntu.
I'll have that.	Ngizoba nakho lokho.
You learn to simplify.	Ufunda ukwenza lula.
There is nothing you or anyone else can do about it.	Akukho lutho wena noma omunye umuntu angakwenza ngalokho.
Still, he refused to cry.	Noma kunjalo, wenqaba ukukhala.
You will know soon.	Uzokwazi ngokushesha.
He stayed another three days.	Wahlala ezinye izinsuku ezintathu.
Later, he left.	Kamuva, wahamba.
Just thinking about it.	Ukucabanga nje ngakho.
But not at the same time.	Kodwa hhayi ngesikhathi esisodwa.
At least, it's not a job.	Okungenani, akuwona umsebenzi.
And he really is.	Futhi nguye ngempela.
I really like everything about it.	Ngithanda kakhulu konke ngakho.
I know better.	Ngiyazi kangcono.

You are coming too.	Nawe uyeza.

All morning hard in the office.	Konke ekuseni kanzima ehhovisi.
You want to have a party.	Ufuna ukwenza iphathi.
You have heard the truth, once.	Uke wezwa iqiniso, kanye.
I want to eat.	Ngifuna ukudla.
The Doctor would be helpful.	UDokotela wayezoba usizo.
That is not obviously the case.	Lokho akunjalo ngokusobala.
I do not have permission.	Anginayo imvume.
I apologize earlier.	Ngiyaxolisa ngaphambilini.
He takes her everywhere he goes.	Uhamba naye yonke indawo lapho eya khona.
There is always something.	Kukhona njalo okuthile.
Dad can be there.	Ubaba angaba khona lapho.
It appears right here.	Kubonakala khona lapha.

We went everywhere.	Sihambe yonke indawo.
But I don't really know.	Kodwa angazi ngempela.
How to.	Kudingeka kanjani.
But in the end, it was worth it.	Kodwa ekugcineni, kwakufanele.
He took the idea from me.	Wathatha umqondo kimi.
I am here for you.	Ngilapha ngawe.
And your place.	Futhi indawo yakho.

Getting bad.	Ukuthola kabi.
You did a good thing, too.	Wenze into enhle, futhi.
But one might.	Kodwa omunye angase.
This will obviously take a long time.	Lokhu ngokusobala kuzothatha isikhathi eside.

And yes, this is really good.	Futhi yebo, lokhu kuhle ngempela.
Not that he doesn't want to go.	Hhayi ukuthi akafuni ukuhamba.
It just doesn't mean anything.	Akusho lutho nje.
How hard it is for him.	Kunzima kanjani kuye.
You do not even know why.	Ubungazi nokuthi kungani.
Everything seems right here.	Konke kubonakala kulungile lapha.

You've found the right place.	Uthole indawo efanele.

I will do it next week.	Ngizokwenza ngesonto elizayo.
This is sometimes the case.	Lokhu kunjalo ngezinye izikhathi.
But so far.	Kodwa kuze kube manje.
He did not speak immediately.	Akazange akhulume ngokushesha.
To say this does not mean anything at all, really.	Ukusho lokhu akusho lutho nhlobo, ngempela.
I have to go again tomorrow.	Kuzomele ngihambe futhi kusasa.
I'm so sorry for the inconvenience.	Ngiyaxolisa kakhulu ngesikhathi esibi.
Because there is a question.	Ngoba kukhona umbuzo.
He refused and asked to leave.	Wenqaba wacela ukuhamba.
He would be so.	Wayezoba njalo .
You will probably win everything.	Cishe uzowina yonke into.
But it can be fast.	Kodwa kungaba ngokushesha.
And he was amazed.	Futhi wamangala.
It seems at least.	Kubonakala sengathi okungenani.
We will not do anything.	Ngeke senze noma yini.
Maybe that person will be you.	Mhlawumbe lowo muntu uzoba nguwe.

You need to make it clear.	Udinga ukukwenza ngokusobala.
Maybe for a while.	Mhlawumbe isikhashana.
I do not want to speak ill of him.	Angifuni ukukhuluma kabi ngaye.
He could not stop thinking about that.	Akakwazanga ukuyeka ukucabanga ngalokho.
But he thought he did it in the beginning.	Kodwa wacabanga ukuthi wakwenza ekuqaleni.
Everyone knew this was not true.	Wonke umuntu wayazi ukuthi lokhu akulona iqiniso.
I couldn’t think much of it.	Angikwazanga ukucabanga kakhulu ngakho.
This time he looked up.	Kulokhu wabheka phezulu.

I can not tell you exactly why now.	Angikwazi ukukutshela kahle ukuthi kungani manje.
We know he is.	Siyazi ukuthi nguye.
It hurts right now.	Ubuhlungu njengamanje.

But in this case, it is not necessary.	Kodwa kulokhu, akudingekile.
And this happens all the time.	Futhi lokhu kwenzeka ngaso sonke isikhathi.

It's too much.	Kuningi kabi.
But it does not seem to be.	Kodwa kubonakala sengathi ayikho.

And we need only one.	Futhi sidinga eyodwa kuphela.
Her mother is a teacher.	Umama wakhe unguthisha.
It should not be done easily.	Akufanele kwenziwe kalula.
Not all at once.	Hhayi konke ngesikhathi esisodwa.
I thought that was possible.	Bengicabanga ukuthi kungenzeka lokho.
He came out with everything.	Waphuma ngakho konke.
This is not very true.	Lokhu akulona iqiniso kakhulu.

He asked where he should go to learn how.	Wabuza ukuthi kufanele aye kuphi ukuze afunde ukuthi kanjani.
Does he know, but does not like? 	Ingabe uyakwazi, kodwa akathandi?
Of course you do not.	Yebo awazi.
I have to get my few things.	Kufanele ngithole izinto zami ezimbalwa.
There is no one in the car.	Akukho muntu phakathi emotweni.

But that would be a terrible thing.	Kodwa lokho kungaba yinto embi kakhulu.

You definitely got the worst.	Nakanjani uthole okubi kakhulu.
He wants to see you soon.	Ufuna ukukubona ngokushesha.
Time, energy, money.	Isikhathi, amandla, imali.
She is a beautiful child too.	Uyingane enhle futhi.
At first up, but slowly down.	Ekuqaleni phezulu, kodwa kancane kancane phansi.

You can do this the way you want.	Ungakwenza lokhu ngendlela ofuna ngayo.
He does everything in his own way.	Wenza konke ngendlela yakhe.
But again, you can't really do much there.	Kodwa futhi, awukwazi ngempela ukwenza okuningi lapho.
Not a bad person either.	Hhayi umuntu omubi futhi.
That's his opinion, though.	Lowo umbono wakhe, noma kunjalo.
No one should know what is going on in our house.	Akekho okufanele azi ukuthi kwenzekani endlini yethu.
Driving almost everywhere.	Ukushayela cishe yonke indawo.
I thought you did very well.	Bengicabanga ukuthi wenze kahle kakhulu.
He left in the morning.	Wahamba ekuseni.
Nobody wants it to happen.	Akekho ofuna kwenzeke.
He did not want me to know that.	Wayengafuni ngikwazi lokho.
We know how.	Siyazi ukuthi kanjani.

You know, flowers.	Uyazi, izimbali.
No, not at all.	Cha, akukho kulokhu.
But this, he must have.	Kodwa lokhu, kufanele abe nakho.
Yes, that can be true, but not today.	Yebo, lokho kungaba njalo, kodwa hhayi namuhla.

He just did it very, very well.	Wenza nje kakhulu, kahle kakhulu.
Here again.	Lapha futhi.
You say this as a bad thing.	Usho lokhu sengathi yinto embi.
But, that is not the case here.	Kodwa, akunjalo lapha.
I feel bad about that.	Ngizizwa kabi ngalokho.

Not as you want him to.	Hhayi njengoba ufuna yena.
Travel in one month.	Ukuhamba ngenyanga eyodwa.
I wonder.	Ngiyamangala.
He doesn't think he can.	Akacabangi ukuthi angakwazi.
It was not worth the time.	Bekungafanele isikhathi.
So the job did well.	Ngakho umsebenzi wenze kahle.
Good, very good.	Kuhle, kakhulu.
Also, he did not have to go to work.	Futhi, kwakungadingeki ukuthi aye emsebenzini.

And this function works perfectly.	Futhi lo msebenzi usebenza ngokuphelele.
I'm not so sure about this.	Angiqiniseki kangako ngale.

Now it can be easier.	Manje kungaba lula.

He obviously wanted to talk to her.	Kusobala ukuthi wayefuna ukukhuluma naye.
He did not say that in the morning.	Akazange asho kanjalo ekuseni.

He never came back.	Akakaze abuye.
Death is not a big deal.	Ukufa akuyona into enkulu.

He really wanted to go and he would be there.	Wayefuna ngempela ukuthi aye khona futhi wayezoba khona.
And, yes, that's fine.	Futhi, yebo, lokho kulungile.

All again, alone.	Konke futhi, ngedwa.
It really happened this time.	Kwenzeka ngempela lesi sikhathi.
Maybe it's true, maybe not.	Mhlawumbe kuyiqiniso, mhlawumbe akunjalo.
Outside there is none.	Ngaphandle akukho.
That's right, but not too much.	Kunjalo, kodwa hhayi kakhulu.
But if he does, he may learn something.	Kodwa uma enza kanjalo, angase afunde okuthile.
This has been very difficult for me.	Lokhu kube nzima kakhulu kimi.
Everyone agreed.	Wonke umuntu wavuma phezulu.
But you should have told me this yesterday.	Kodwa bekumele ungitshele lokhu izolo.
He has gone out and walked away.	Uye waphuma wahamba.
Someone else, maybe.	Omunye umuntu, mhlawumbe.
I have to find the truth first.	Kufanele ngithole iqiniso kuqala.
Now she is happy.	Manje uyajabula.

He did not have to say much more.	Kwakungadingeki akhulume okwengeziwe.

Probably better this way.	Cishe kungcono ngale ndlela.
That could be now.	Lokho kungaba manje.
You can't say no.	Ngeke ukwazi ukusho ukuthi akunjalo.

But this did happen.	Kodwa lokhu kwenzeka.
For other things.	Ngezinye izinto.
If he does.	Uma enza kanjalo.
Not alone.	Hhayi wedwa.

And you did a great job here.	Futhi wenze umsebenzi omkhulu lapha.
He took me out here.	Waphuma nami lapha.
I didn’t want to do it at the time.	Ngangingafuni ukuzenza ngaleso sikhathi.
He did not have to read this correctly for the first time.	Kwakungadingeki ukuba afunde kahle lokhu okokuqala.
But almost always, when you think about it.	Kodwa cishe njalo, uma ucabanga ngakho.
In this case it will be better.	Kulokhu kuzoba ngcono.

I'm sure you will too.	Ngiyaqiniseka ukuthi nawe uzokwenza.
He tried hard at one point.	Wazama kanzima ngesikhathi esisodwa.
But her problem is that she can't cry.	Kodwa inkinga yakhe ukuthi akakwazi ukukhala.
Work has to do one thing.	Umsebenzi kufanele wenze into eyodwa.

This will be great !.	Lokhu kuzoba kuhle!.
But thank you for that moment.	Kodwa ngiyabonga ngaleso sikhathi.
And he was able to walk.	Futhi wakwazi ukuhamba.
But the question remains.	Kodwa umbuzo ukhona.
No one does that anyway.	Akekho owenza kanjalo kunjalo.
This is not a reason at all.	Lesi akusona isizathu nhlobo.
Even if it seems difficult.	Ngisho noma kubonakala kunzima.
Even if you did.	Noma ngabe ukwenzile.
False lies.	Amanga amanga.
I saw a doctor.	Ngabona udokotela.
But that is not the problem today.	Kodwa leyo akuyona inkinga namuhla.
He thought that anything could happen.	Wayecabanga ukuthi kungenzeka noma yini.
It's good to see that.	Kuhle ukukubona lokho.
Instead, we want to talk.	Kunalokho, sifuna ukukhuluma.
But he can definitely do it all.	Kodwa nakanjani angakwenza konke.
We have to rebuild.	Kufanele sakhe kabusha.
This, so far.	Lokhu, kuze kube manje.
He walked slowly behind me.	Wahamba kancane ngemuva kwami.
You must stay outside.	Kumelwe uhlale ngaphandle.
He saw a lot !.	Wabona okuningi!.
You should be present for this.	Kufanele ube khona kulokhu.
My friend told me.	Umngane wami wangitshela.
He left immediately.	Uhambe ngokushesha.
If you will stay.	Uma uzohlala.
Everyone went out.	Wonke umuntu waphuma.
I suspect that's probably the problem.	Ngisola ukuthi mhlawumbe inkinga.
We want one at a time.	Sifuna eyodwa ngesikhathi.
Well, all of that may be a lie.	Kulungile, konke lokho kungase kube amanga.
It will never be me.	Ngeke neze kube yimina.
Or at least for now.	Noma okungenani okwamanje.
It should be that easy.	Kufanele kube lula kanjalo.
But only together.	Kodwa ndawonye kuphela.
No one here knows what happened to him.	Akekho lapha owaziyo ukuthi kwenzekani kuye.
So we did more.	Ngakho senza okwengeziwe.
Simply put, it sounds good.	Kalula nje, kuzwakala kulungile.
He probably did.	Kungenzeka ukuthi wakwenza.
He really wanted me.	Wayefuna kakhulu kimi.
I think he goes well with me.	Ngicabanga ukuthi uhamba kahle nami.
A real team.	Iqembu impela.
His eyes returned to her.	Abuye amehlo akhe kuye.
Everyone did what they could.	Wonke umuntu wenza lokho akwazi ukukwenza.
But you did not come.	Kodwa awuzange ube khona.
Maybe that ??? 	Mhlawumbe lokho???
She is better than me.	Kungcono yena kunami.
He thinks it is good.	Ucabanga ukuthi kuhle.
All of this is clear enough.	Konke lokhu kusobala ngokwanele.
I had to do something else.	Kwadingeka ngenze okunye.
So you can really see that quickly.	Ngakho ungakwazi ngempela ukubona ukuthi ngokushesha.
And she is happy now.	Futhi uyajabula manje.
We did the testing.	Senza ukuhlolwa.
I hope so much.	Ngethemba kakhulu.
No one wants pain.	Akekho ofuna ubuhlungu.
He speaks his mind.	Ukhuluma umqondo wakhe.
This is excellent advice.	Lesi iseluleko esihle kakhulu.
I still can't help but wonder.	Namanje angikwazi ukuzibamba ngiyamangala.
This should be very difficult.	Lokhu kumele kube nzima kakhulu.
He also did not have her.	Naye akazange abe naye.
Nothing at all.	Akukho nhlobo.
I'm afraid you can.	Ngesaba ukuthi ungakwazi.
You need to know how to do it.	Kumele wazi ukuthi ukwenze kanjani.
It may be helpful to talk to him.	Kungaba usizo ukukhuluma naye.
Everyone is right.	Wonke umuntu usho kahle.
I really want to get that.	Ngifuna ngempela ukuthola lokho.
Now, that's a ride.	Manje, lokho ukugibela.
My mother is there.	Umama ukhona.
I would love to go in with him anyway.	Ngingathanda ukungena naye noma kunjalo.
It's not here, it's not there.	Akukho lapha, akukho lapho.
I never thought he would do it.	Bengingacabangi ukuthi uzokwenza.
Hopefully not always.	Ngethemba hhayi njalo.
Everything is done in the right way.	Konke kwenziwe ngendlela efanele.
He made a great teacher.	Wenza uthisha omkhulu.
Then tomorrow.	Khona kusasa .
Tell me, if it happens.	Ngitshele, uma kwenzeka.
Not the baby, mom.	Hhayi ingane, umama.
Or not at all.	Noma cha impela .
He did not know it at the time but it should be.	Wayengazi ngaleso sikhathi kodwa kufanele kube njalo.
I can't be with you around.	Angeke ngikwazi ukuba nawe eduze.
I was thinking about this last night.	Bengicabanga ngalokhu izolo ebusuku.
Now, not later.	Manje, hhayi kamuva.
You will not have to think about it.	Ngeke kudingeke ucabange ngakho.
Because you absolutely do that.	Ngoba ukwenza ngokuphelele lokho.
Easy exit.	Ukuphuma kalula.
His mind works all the time.	Umqondo wakhe usebenza ngaso sonke isikhathi.
Until tonight, that's right.	Kuze kube namuhla ebusuku, kunjalo.
There is also.	Kukhona futhi.
One should not speak.	Umuntu akufanele akhulume.
He doesn't want to hear anything.	Akafuni ukuzwa lutho.
He thought it might be three months.	Wacabanga ukuthi mhlawumbe izinyanga ezintathu.
Now or.	Manje noma.
He probably thought she was my mother.	Cishe wayecabanga ukuthi umama wami.
But it will happen in the end.	Kodwa kuzokwenzeka ekugcineni.
But not everything.	Kodwa hhayi cishe konke.
It should be out.	Kufanele kube ukuphuma.
Now, there is no need.	Manje, asikho isidingo.
This is probably a problem.	Lokhu cishe inkinga.
A lot to think about.	Kuningi ukucabanga.
So maybe you should be talking to him.	Ngakho mhlawumbe kufanele ngabe ukhuluma naye.
I don't really remember why.	Angisakhumbuli ngempela ukuthi kungani.
Good idea but it needs some work.	Umqondo omuhle kodwa udinga umsebenzi othile.
Of course not.	Yebo akukho.
This is very good today.	Lokhu kuhle kakhulu namuhla.
Just a few questions about that.	Imibuzo embalwa nje ngalokho.
Not him, of course.	Hhayi yena, kunjalo.
But today at school you say something.	Kodwa namuhla esikoleni usho okuthile.
And do the work again if you have the time.	Futhi wenze umsebenzi futhi uma unesikhathi.
I want to know, too.	Ngifuna ukwazi, nami.
But he didn't want to do that, either.	Kodwa wayengafuni ukwenza lokho, futhi.
Or other things.	Noma ezinye izinto.
Not in the summer, at least.	Hhayi ehlobo, okungenani.
And me too.	Futhi nami futhi.
This happened yesterday.	Lokhu kwenzeke izolo.
My advice is not to do it.	Iseluleko sami ukuthi ungakwenzi.
She is very good at working with him.	Muhle kakhulu ukusebenza naye.
Stop drinking.	Ukuyeka ukuphuza.
You did a good thing.	Wenze into enhle.
He was thinking positively.	Wayecabanga kahle.
well, that's it.	kuhle, yilokho.
Stupid! 	Isilima!
And you need to know.	Futhi udinga ukwazi.
He knew this and came to me.	Wakwazi lokhu futhi weza kimi.
There is always a better way.	Kukhona njalo indlela engcono.
This is not the best time.	Lesi akusona isikhathi esihle kakhulu.
I think too many things.	Ngicabanga izinto eziningi kakhulu.
I could not say better.	Bengingeke ngisho kangcono.
She is beautiful, but painful.	Muhle, kodwa ubuhlungu.
And how difficult it can be.	Futhi kungaba nzima kangakanani.
If so, what is your opinion of it?	Uma kunjalo, uthini umbono wakho ngakho?
But, to me.	Kodwa, kimi.
It's just fine there.	Kuhle nje lapho.
Obviously there.	Kusobala lapho.
He has no plan.	Akanalo icebo.
Or maybe so he can.	Noma mhlawumbe ukuze akwazi.
But there are other things.	Kodwa kukhona ezinye izinto.
He can ride a bike.	Angakwazi ukugibela ibhayisikili .
Maybe sleeping in the middle.	Mhlawumbe ukulala phakathi.
He can just do it.	Angakwenza nje .
This is not all.	Akuyona yonke le ndawo.
And here.	Futhi lapha .
I said no, thank you.	Ngathi cha, ngiyabonga.
I want you to be happy all the time.	Ngifuna ujabule ngaso sonke isikhathi.
For months, he thought.	Izinyanga, wacabanga.
It will not all be your job.	Ngeke konke kube umsebenzi wakho.
Man feels alone in the universe.	Umuntu uzizwa eyedwa endaweni yonke.
But that.	Kodwa lokho.
This is good, this is very good.	Lokhu kuhle, lokhu kuhle kakhulu.
I never found anything.	Angikaze ngithole lutho.
There must be someone.	Kumele kube khona umuntu.
You want as many eyes as you can.	Ufuna amehlo amaningi ngangokunokwenzeka.
Very, very, very much.	Kakhulu, kakhulu, kakhulu.
Yes, we do some of you too.	Yebo, senza okunye kwakho futhi.
But it was not someone else.	Kodwa kwakungeyena omunye umuntu.
He noticed, of course.	Waqaphela, kunjalo.
It is by no means a trivial matter.	Akuyona neze into encane.
Many churches too.	Amasonto amaningi futhi.
He came with all his might.	Weza nakho konke okusemandleni akhe.
When are you coming.	Uya nini.
He might have it, of course.	Angase abe nakho, kunjalo.
Everyone wants to come.	Wonke umuntu ufuna ukuza.
me too.	nami futhi.
I knew it wouldn't happen.	Ngangazi ukuthi ngeke kube khona.
I live here instead.	Ngihlala lapha esikhundleni.
Tomorrow the office will be better.	Kusasa ehhovisi kuzoba ngcono.
He would like to come to the meeting.	Angathanda ukuza emhlanganweni.
What happens will happen.	Okwenzekayo kuzokwenzeka.
Not too fast, not too little.	Hhayi ngokushesha kakhulu, hhayi kancane kakhulu.
But he would not do such a thing.	Kodwa wayengeke enze into enjalo.
Not alone.	Hhayi yedwa.
It's just too much.	Kuphela nje kuningi kakhulu.
I will do everything as needed.	Ngizokwenza konke njengoba kudingeka.
Help me.	Ngisize .
Crying is good.	Ukukhala kuhle.
The biggest thing in the world.	Into enkulu emhlabeni.
I hear that every morning.	Ngizwa lokho njalo ekuseni.
But you have to do more.	Kodwa kufanele wenze okuthile okwengeziwe.
He just wanted to talk about your homework.	Wayefuna nje ukukhuluma ngomsebenzi wakho wesikole.
It may be singing.	Kungase kube ukucula.
In our way.	Ngendlela yethu.
You can also sing or sing.	Ungakwazi futhi ukucula noma ukucula.
Please, stay in the car.	Ngicela, uhlale emotweni.
He noticed something immediately.	Waqaphela okuthile ngaso leso sikhathi.
You know, we're not about that.	Uyazi, asikho ngalokho.
You can't take a car there.	Awukwazi ukuthatha imoto lapho.
That, too, can only be good.	Lokho, futhi, kungaba kuhle kuphela.
Or a place.	Noma indawo.
At least, a few times a year.	Okungenani, izikhathi ezimbalwa ngonyaka.
I have to be here, really.	Kufanele ngibe lapha, ngempela.
He will not be able to help you.	Angeke akwazi ukukusiza.
Not here, like this.	Hhayi lapha, kanje.
He knows nothing.	Akwazi lutho.
I thought about that every day.	Ngangicabanga ngalokho nsuku zonke.
It's okay to choose.	Kulungile ukukhetha.
Yes, he does.	Yebo, usho kanjalo.
Buying lies entirely.	Ukuthenga amanga ngokuphelele.
He wanted it to be a question.	Wayefuna kube umbuzo.
But the boy did not know.	Kodwa umfana wayengazi.
But not alone.	Kodwa hhayi ngedwa.
I found shoes right there at work.	Ngithole izicathulo khona lapho emsebenzini.
I want to be her every day.	Ngifuna ukuba nguye nsuku zonke.
Behind him, another voice.	Ngemva kwakhe, elinye izwi.
He wanted to be alone with her.	Wayefuna ukuba yedwa naye.
I need to move on with that.	Ngidinga ukuqhubeka nalokho.
He told me to stay.	Wangitshela ukuthi ngihlale.
I have been fine since then.	Ngihambe kahle kusukela lapho.
And what to do.	Futhi okumele ukwenze.
I will do all the work.	Ngizokwenza wonke umsebenzi.
I've had a few problems.	Ngithole izinkinga ezimbalwa.
It's just right that you should.	Kulungile nje ukuthi kufanele.
This is a good answer.	Lena impendulo enhle.
I have to talk to him myself.	Kumele ngikhulume naye mina.
Finding a room is not the case.	Ukuthola igumbi akunjalo.
Not very pretty.	Hhayi muhle impela.
He goes home every night.	Uya ekhaya njalo ebusuku.
And this is still happening to me.	Futhi lokhu kwenzeka kimi namanje.
It is also possible to play once.	Kungenzeka futhi ukudlala kanye.
Everyone has been really good at this.	Wonke umuntu ube muhle ngempela ngalokhu.
But you do not have to buy into that.	Kodwa awudingi ukuthenga kulokho.
Slowly a sound came into him.	Kancane kancane umsindo wangena kuye.
You're kidding me now.	Udlala ngami manje.
I just want to end this problem.	Ngifuna nje ukuqeda le nkinga.
This is true enough.	Lokhu kuyiqiniso ngokwanele.
Soon I did.	Ngokushesha ngenza.
People, a little bit.	Abantu, kancane.
The question should be.	Umbuzo kufanele kube.
All right, yes again.	Kulungile, yebo futhi.
It just needed energy.	Kwakudingeka amandla nje.
He had to drive.	Kwadingeka ashayele.
He knew it well.	Wakwazi kahle.
It could be me too.	Kungenzeka ukuthi nami.
I think about this tonight.	Ngicabanga ngalokhu ebusuku.
But we know that he did.	Kodwa siyazi ukuthi wakwenza.
He thinks he can do that.	Ucabanga ukuthi angakwenza lokho.
He stayed there a long, long time.	Wahlala lapho isikhathi eside, eside.
We may be here for hours.	Kungenzeka sibe lapha amahora.
No, everyone does that.	Cha, wonke umuntu wenza kanjalo.
Just being there.	Ukuba lapho nje.
So sleep again.	Ngakho ukulala futhi.
But in my own way.	Kodwa ngendlela yami.
It could be a week.	Kungase kube isonto.
The atmosphere is very good.	Umoya muhle kakhulu.
He thought it wasn't.	Wacabanga ukuthi kwakungeyena.
You think about it all the time.	Ucabanga ngakho ngaso sonke isikhathi.
That would be a good thing in the world.	Lokho kungaba yinto enhle emhlabeni.
He told me almost immediately.	Wangitshela cishe ngaso leso sikhathi.
Not before, not after.	Hhayi ngaphambi, hhayi ngemuva.
Weeks if necessary.	Amasonto uma kufanele.
Very good, but there is more.	Kuhle kakhulu, kodwa kukhona okwengeziwe.
And it should be done now.	Futhi kufanele kwenziwe manje.
That is a very large window.	Iwindi elikhulu kakhulu lelo.
He said that was very good.	Wathi kuhle kakhulu lokho.
But he will be back soon.	Kodwa uzobuya maduze.
He did all this.	Wenza konke lokhu.
So he told the police.	Ngakho watshela amaphoyisa.
Or nothing at all.	Noma lutho nhlobo.
I don't understand why you did this.	Angiqondi ukuthi kungani wenza lokhu.
What money.	Yini imali.
But you are reading this.	Kodwa ufunda lokhu.
Maybe that should be the case.	Mhlawumbe lokho kufanele kube njalo.
How should I deal with it.	Kufanele ngenze kanjani ngakho.
There is nothing you need to do right now.	Akukho okumele ukwenze okwamanje.
No one is doing anything right.	Akekho owenza okuthile kahle.
We do a lot of traveling together.	Senza okuningi kakhulu ukuhamba ndawonye.
There is no need to do this.	Asikho isidingo sokwenza lokhu.
It is not the way one wants to go.	Akuyona indlela umuntu afuna ukuhamba ngayo.
He did not want to go there at all.	Wayengafuni nhlobo ukuya lapho.
That should not be a big question.	Lokho akufanele kube umbuzo omkhulu.
I probably knew from the beginning.	Cishe ngabe ngazi kusukela ekuqaleni.
You can't smoke.	Awukwazi ukubhema.
he spoke alone.	wakhuluma yedwa.
Any of us can.	Noma ubani kithi angakwazi.
And he told me that everyone knows.	Futhi wangitshela ukuthi wonke umuntu uyazi.
He was not sure if he would like an answer.	Wayengenaso isiqiniseko sokuthi angathanda ukuthola impendulo.
I can't go home.	Angikwazi ukuya ekhaya.
Now what do you say.	Manje uthini.
That's a big mistake.	Iphutha elikhulu elikhulu lokho.
At least, not to us.	Okungenani, hhayi kithi.
It should never be completely.	Akufanele neze ngokuphelele.
It happened.	Kwenzekeni.
It does happen, though.	Kwenzekani, noma kunjalo.
He probably wouldn’t be much anyway.	Cishe wayengeke abe okuningi noma kunjalo.
He thought that anything could happen to him.	Wayecabanga ukuthi kungenzeka noma yini kuye.
He is not at home or in the office.	Akekho ekhaya noma ehhovisi.
I did not want to eat or drink anything.	Ngangingafuni ukudla noma ukuphuza noma yini.
Not to me though.	Hhayi kimi noma kunjalo.
Really, really, really.	Ngempela, ngempela, kunjalo.
Well done, and thank you.	Wenze kahle, futhi ngiyabonga.
Have you ever thought.	Uke wacabanga .
We need to rework.	Sidinga ukusebenza kabusha.
I haven't thought about it since.	Angizange ngicabange ngakho kusukela ngaleso sikhathi.
I'm not sure about that, yet.	Anginaso isiqiniseko kulokho, okwamanje.
He did the same thing to me.	Wenze into efanayo kimi.
I hope you enjoy our work.	Ngethemba ukuthi ujabule ngomsebenzi wethu.
I know that's hard for you.	Ngiyazi ukuthi lokho kunzima kuwe.
I don't know anyone there.	Angazi muntu lapho.
As you always do.	Njengoba wenza njalo.
But when you make a mistake.	Kodwa lapho wenza iphutha.
He realized that.	Waqaphela lokho.
But it is good for me.	Kodwa kuhle kimi.
The answer, of course, is no.	Impendulo, empeleni, cha.
He did not tell the truth.	Akazange akhulume iqiniso.
There should be only one thing.	Kufanele kube yinto eyodwa kuphela.
He had to do it again.	Kwadingeka akwenze futhi.
So, maybe not.	Ngakho, mhlawumbe akunjalo.
How it should have happened.	Ukuthi bekufanele kwenzeke kanjani.
I can't do without him.	Angikwazi ukwenza ngaphandle kwakhe.
That would be great.	Kungaba kuhle kakhulu lokho.
Stop doing this too much.	Yeka lokhu ukwenza ngokweqile.
But as soon as it happened, well.	Kodwa ngokushesha lapho kwenzeka, kahle.
At that moment, she had to do something.	Ngaso leso sikhathi, kwadingeka enze okuthile.
I had to come with him.	Kwadingeka ngize naye.
Just as you should have done.	Njengoba nje bekufanele wenze.
He never had it.	Akazange abe nakho njalo.
I need to know now.	Kumele ngazi manje.
I had a great time there.	Ngibe nesikhathi esihle kakhulu lapho.
Down, right now, right here.	Phansi, khona manje, khona lapha.
However, that is not the problem right now.	Noma kunjalo, leyo akuyona inkinga njengamanje.
And because he can.	Futhi ngoba angakwazi.
I'm not a good idea.	Angiyena umbono omuhle.
This is a good move.	Ukuhamba kahle lokhu.
I would like to know.	Ngingathanda ukwazi .
So three weeks on that.	Ngakho amasonto amathathu ngalokho.
You obviously want to help.	Ngokusobala ufuna ukusiza.
He did the work for it.	Wenza umsebenzi ngakho.
He had to talk to her for a long time.	Kwadingeka akhulume naye isikhathi eside.
Yes, there is that too.	Yebo, kukhona lokho futhi.
More often than not, really.	Kaningi kunalokho, ngempela.
Where my family lives.	Lapho umndeni wami uhlala khona.
That would be very easy for him.	Lokho kungaba lula kakhulu kuye.
But that's a really bad idea.	Kodwa lowo umqondo omubi ngempela.
He sat down with her.	Wahlala phansi naye.
We will not have long.	Ngeke sibe nesikhathi eside.
But maybe you went a little further for him.	Kodwa mhlawumbe uhambe kancane kuye.
And why should it.	Futhi kungani kufanele.
But he did not have to do anything about it.	Kodwa kwakungadingeki enze lutho ngakho.
You will need money.	Uzodinga imali.
You know you need to get better.	Uyazi ukuthi udinga ukuba ngcono kakhulu.
Only a child.	Ingane kuphela.
I talk about this all the time.	Ngikhuluma ngalokhu ngaso sonke isikhathi.
It should be easy to do, but it is not.	Kufanele kube lula ukukwenza, kodwa akunjalo.
Not in class for a few years.	Hhayi ekilasini iminyaka embalwa.
He is very eager to learn.	Uzimisele kakhulu ukufunda.
He asked what it was.	Wabuza ukuthi yini.
The new one looked up.	Omusha wabheka phezulu.
Or maybe not all of us.	Noma mhlawumbe hhayi sonke.
We have to do something about this.	Kufanele senze okuthile ngalokhu.
A really new job.	Umsebenzi omusha ngempela.
He once wondered.	Wake wazibuza.
Yes, he was.	Yebo, wayesaba.
And I'm a little excited.	Futhi ngijabule kancane.
I know about you now.	Ngiyazi ngawe manje.
He wouldn't, either.	Wayengeke, futhi.
I'm just trying to get there.	Ngizama nje ukufika lapho.
Something had to be done about it.	Kwakufanele kwenziwe okuthile ngalokho.
But it is true, too.	Kodwa kuyiqiniso, futhi.
I thought it could be you.	Bengicabanga ukuthi kungaba uwena.
Probably too much has happened.	Mhlawumbe kuningi kakhulu okwenzekile.
I can't remember last night.	Angisakhumbuli izolo ebusuku.
You need to do something.	Kudingeka ukwenza okuthile.
If and if and if.	Uma futhi uma futhi uma.
She seemed a little happy.	Wayebonakala ejabule kancane.
Just one, after all.	Omunye nje, ngemuva kwakho konke.
I can't wait to see you at work.	Angikwazi ukulinda ukukubona usebenza.
Maybe you never thought of it.	Mhlawumbe awuzange ucabange ngakho.
He has been in school for years.	Uhambe iminyaka esikoleni.
One has to know why.	Umuntu kufanele azi ukuthi kungani.
Anyone can do that at any time.	Noma ubani angakwenza lokho noma nini.
All right, there is.	Kulungile, kukhona.
Let me tell you one thing.	Ake ngikutshele into eyodwa.
That is not really your house.	Akuyona indlu yakho ngempela leyo.
But neither he nor his mother said anything.	Kodwa yena noma umama akakaze asho lutho.
Probably never happened to him before.	Mhlawumbe akuzange kwenzeke kuye ngaphambili.
The answer is no.	Impendulo ayikho ngempela.
He wants something from us.	Ufuna okunye kithi.
I know that is not true of me.	Ngiyazi ukuthi lokho akulona iqiniso ngami.
There is something really great.	Kukhona into enkulu ngempela.
Making it harder to walk.	Ukwenza kube nzima ukuhamba.
When you play well, you stay.	Uma udlala kahle, uhlala.
I feel so good.	Ngizizwa kufanele kakhulu.
My mother asked if there was a problem.	Umama wabuza ukuthi ngabe kukhona yini inkinga.
Now, you are happy.	Manje, ujabule.
But that is not a good job.	Kodwa lowo akuwona umsebenzi omuhle.
He said so.	Wakhuluma kunjalo.
So much cannot be done about this.	Kuningi kakhulu angeke kwenziwe ngalokhu.
And maybe friends.	Futhi mhlawumbe abangani.
He sat there, amazed.	Wahlala lapho, emangele.
No, very soon.	Cha, ngokushesha kakhulu.
So there is no certainty.	Ngakho asikho isiqiniseko.
What else? 	Yini enye?
Because maybe you did.	Ngoba mhlawumbe ukwenzile.
He is the best player.	Ungumdlali ongcono kakhulu.
But sometimes he can't.	Kodwa ngezinye izikhathi akakwazi.
So he can be here for a while.	Ngakho angaba lapha isikhashana.
Thinking through action.	Ukucabanga ngokwenza.
Everything has been fine since then.	Konke kube kuhle kusukela ngaleso sikhathi.
He looked, he saw.	Wabheka, wabona.
My mother lives here.	Umama uhlala lapha.
Your way.	Indlela yakho.
That will be helpful.	Lokho kuzoba usizo.
There is nothing near him, no one.	Eduze kwakhe akukho lutho, akekho.
He decided to become a teacher.	Wanquma ukuba uthisha.
I do not want to read my life too closely.	Angifuni ukufunda ukuphila kwami ​​eduze kakhulu.
Is that true? 	Ingabe kuyiqiniso lokho?
I will not be able to sleep for the rest of the week.	Ngeke ngikwazi ukulala isonto lonke elizayo.
He was completely alone.	Waba yedwa ngokuphelele.
And no, once.	Futhi hhayi, kanye.
I had to get there.	Kwadingeka ngifike lapho.

But, still, he did very well.	Kodwa, noma kunjalo, wenza kahle kakhulu.
This is just hard.	Kunzima nje lokhu.
Let me think about it a little bit.	Ake ngicabange ngakho kancane.
He finally realized he wasn't.	Ekugcineni waqaphela ukuthi wayengeyena.
It seems the whole city is asleep this morning.	Kubonakala sengathi wonke umuzi ulele namhlanje ekuseni.
That seems better to me.	Lokho kubonakala kungcono kimi.
Or so you say.	Noma usho kanjalo.
I know you don't want to be there.	Ngiyazi awufuni lapho.
Because when he is not.	Ngoba uma engekho .
The Father returned to him.	Wabuyela kuye uBaba.
He also lived here for the rest of his life.	Naye wahlala lapha impilo yakhe yonke.
Here not so much.	Lapha hhayi kakhulu.
I don't think so at all.	Angicabangi kanjalo nhlobo.
In one place.	Endaweni eyodwa.
But he decided to take a chance.	Kodwa wanquma ukuthatha ithuba.

Eventually he had to say something.	Ekugcineni kwadingeka asho okuthile.
You read down.	Ufunda phansi.
But you look confident, now.	Kodwa ubonakala uqinisekile, manje.
I live there today.	Ngihlala lapho namuhla.

And we seem to have done just that.	Futhi kubonakala sengathi senze kanjalo.
If so, not at all.	Uma kunjalo, akunjalo neze.
He should have done something wrong.	Bekumele enze into embi.
I did a good job, too.	Ngenze umsebenzi omuhle, nami.
Not my door.	Hhayi umnyango wami.
I can't even pick one.	Angikwazi ngisho ukukhetha eyodwa.

He stayed there again.	Wahlala khona futhi.
So everything has to be in place.	Ngakho konke kufanele kube endaweni.
All this, you know.	Konke lokhu, uyazi.
Yes he told me.	Yebo wangitshela .
No, it will not always be easy.	Cha, ngeke kube lula ngaso sonke isikhathi.
You should not say that.	Akufanele ukusho lokho.
I know exactly why.	Ngazi kahle ukuthi kungani.
You probably would not come back.	Cishe ubengeke abuye.
Obviously, he did not do that.	Ngokusobala, akazange akwenze lokho.
It's nothing 'but.	Akuyona into 'kodwa.
Come with me.	Ukuza nami.
He wanted her to know the truth.	Wayefuna ukuthi azi iqiniso.
But he knew that he would not be able to stay.	Kodwa wayazi ukuthi wayengeke akwazi ukuhlala.
I know who I talked to for whatever reason.	Ngiyazi ukuthi ngikhulume nobani ngasiphi isizathu.
So read on.	Ngakho ukufunda.
Someone later told me that it was.	Kamuva othile wangitshela ukuthi kunjalo.
Maybe this is his new thing.	Mhlawumbe yinto yakhe entsha lena.
Not that he did, of course.	Hhayi ukuthi wakwenza, kunjalo.
That's a good message.	Umlayezo omuhle lowo.
My family is there.	Umndeni wami ukhona.
All of this he has obviously done.	Konke lokhu ngokusobala ukwenzile.
You must arrive early for work.	Kumele ukuthi ufike ekuseni kakhulu emsebenzini.
I have always wanted to see this place.	Bengilokhu ngifuna ukubona le ndawo.
There is no other choice, really.	Akukho okunye ukukhetha, ngempela.
These are the questions.	Lena imibuzo.
You never want that to happen.	Awufuni neze kwenzeke lokho.
He just can't take a chance.	Akakwazi nje ukuthatha ithuba.
I want to go back to college.	Ngifuna ukubuyela ekolishi.
That could be anyone.	Lokho kungase kube noma ubani.
I do everything or nothing.	Ngenza konke noma lutho.
It was absolutely unnecessary.	Kwakungadingeki nhlobo.
It has to be human.	Kufanele kube umuntu.

Definitely worth the money.	Nakanjani kufanele imali.
Not next year or next month, but today.	Hhayi ngonyaka ozayo noma ngenyanga ezayo, kodwa namuhla.
Almost always people.	Cishe njalo abantu.
Not a friend.	Hhayi umngane.
And he made the day.	Futhi wenza usuku.
He knows what he wants to do.	Uyakwazi afuna ukukwenza.
Of course, it does not have to be this way.	Yebo, akudingekile ukuba kube kanjalo.
I don't believe this is right.	Angikholwa ukuthi lokhu kulungile.
It just had to be done.	Kwakufanele nje kwenziwe.
I know you are here at home with us.	Ngiyazi ukuthi ulapha ekhaya nathi.

Because it happens anyway.	Ngoba kwenzeka noma kunjalo.
It may be working.	Kungase kube ukusebenza.
Okay, but it could be better.	Kulungile, kodwa kungaba ngcono.
He was not a good teacher.	Wayengeyena uthisha onekhono.
And he was hoping to make money.	Futhi wayenethemba lokwenza imali.
But we have to go easy.	Kodwa kuzofanele sihambe kalula.
There would be no danger, he thought.	Angeke kube khona ingozi, wayecabanga.
And this is not a job.	Futhi lokhu akuwona umsebenzi.
Why is there even a question.	Kungani kukhona ngisho umbuzo.
You should not have known.	Kufanele ngabe ubungazi.
I'm not sure if this is a problem.	Angiqiniseki ukuthi inkinga yini lena.
Or maybe not at all.	Noma mhlawumbe akukho nhlobo.
I have become stupid, too.	Ngibe isilima, futhi.
You will be able to do so much with me.	Uzokwazi ukwenza okuningi kakhulu nami.
He is also not your person.	Akayena futhi umuntu wakho.
When you need to earn money.	Lapho udinga ukuthola imali.
I am not such a bad person.	Angiyena umuntu omubi kangaka.
He is there with me.	Ukhona nami lapho.
I really want to go back to school.	Ngifuna ngempela ukubuyela esikoleni.

Also, do not do this.	Futhi, ungakwenzi lokhu.

I never thought where it was.	Angikaze ngicabange ukuthi kuphi.
He was not there when he got home.	Wayengekho lapho efika ekhaya.
He said good, good.	Wathi kuhle, kuhle.
Early morning at the office.	Ekuseni ekuseni ehhovisi.
And something completely different.	Futhi okunye ngokuphelele.

He made it clear now.	Wakwenza kwacaca manje.
He would love to hear from you !.	Angathanda ukuzwa kuwe!.
You better get a place soon !.	Kungcono uthole indawo ngokushesha!.
But he was not alone.	Kodwa wayengekho yedwa.

Now it is very good.	Manje kuhle kakhulu.
Too much to do.	Ukwenza okuningi kakhulu.

He doesn't want things.	Akafuni izinto.
He says what he has to say.	Usho okumele akusho.
But in the end, he could not.	Kodwa ekugcineni, akakwazanga.
He, of course.	Yena, kunjalo.
He lives with us now.	Uhlala nathi manje.
That was probably the first thing that happened.	Cishe yilokho okwenzeka okokuqala.
Because you will get nothing.	Ngoba ngeke uthole lutho.
It should not be this way.	Akufanele kube ngale ndlela.
Not immediately, he knew that.	Hhayi ngokushesha, wakwazi lokho.
I'm just glad you read my stuff.	Ngijabule nje ukuthi ufunda izinto zami.
First the name.	Okokuqala igama.

That happened to me.	Lokho kwenzeka kimi.
It should be okay.	Kufanele kulungile.
I knew one thing.	Ngangazi into eyodwa.
Not people at all.	Hhayi abantu nhlobo.
He thought hard.	Wacabanga kanzima.
Only time.	Isikhathi kuphela.
He just went like that.	Wahamba kanjalo nje.
So you can't eat or drink for a while.	Ngakho awukwazi ukudla noma ukuphuza isikhashana.
I can't anyway.	Angikwazi noma kunjalo.
Still, it is quite true.	Noma kunjalo, kuyiqiniso impela.
It would be easy enough to do it.	Kungaba lula ngokwanele ukukwenza.
I will make a new life here.	Ngizokwenza impilo entsha lapha.
No, not at all, no.	Hhayi, akunjalo, cha.

So he thought for a moment.	Ngakho wacabanga isikhashana.
But we will not do that to you.	Kodwa ngeke sikwenze lokho kuwe.
If you know about it it is not a big deal.	Uma wazi ngakho akuyona into enkulu.

And maybe so.	Futhi mhlawumbe kungaba njalo.
But maybe not that much.	Kodwa mhlawumbe hhayi ukuthi okuningi.
I sat next to him on the bed.	Ngihlale eduze kwakhe embhedeni.
All you have to do is say a word.	Okufanele ukwenze nje ukusho izwi.
At first there is nothing.	Ekuqaleni akukho lutho.
I apologize for the work.	Ngiyaxolisa ngomsebenzi.
I doubt very much that it will happen.	Ngiyangabaza kakhulu ukuthi kuzokwenzeka.
This.	Lokhu .
He told me that was it.	Wangitshela ukuthi yilokho.
He must not think.	Akumele acabange.

He immediately approached her.	Ngokushesha waya kuye.
But think for a moment.	Kodwa ake ucabange isikhashana.

Finally she began to cry.	Ekugcineni waqala ukukhala.
I need to do something tonight.	Ngidinga ukwenza okuthile namhlanje ebusuku.
Her parents, her friends.	Abazali bakhe, abangani bakhe.
In this case it is not a risk.	Kulokhu akuyona ingozi.

Sometimes it can be difficult.	Ngezinye izikhathi kungaba nzima.

I would like to read.	Ngingathanda ukufunda.
You need to move as fast as you can.	Udinga ukuhamba ngokushesha ngangokunokwenzeka.

He made that clear.	Ukwenze kwacaca lokho.
But this is not a problem.	Kodwa lokhu akuyona inkinga.
I found a family.	Ngithole umndeni.
I can't stay with him.	Angikwazi ukuhlala naye.
Themba stayed for a while.	UThemba wahlala isikhashana.
He took his beer.	Wathatha ubhiya wakhe.
His idea, of course.	Umqondo wakhe, kunjalo.
No, not at all.	Cha, hhayi nakancane.
Thinking again.	Ukucabanga futhi.
Being busy is not my reason.	Ukuba matasa akusona isizathu sami.
Something happened earlier.	Kukhona okwenzeka ngaphambili.
I could not do that either.	Nami angikwazanga ukukwenza lokho.
He just could not do it alone.	Wayengeke nje akwenze eyedwa.
I think there really is something in this.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kukhona ngempela kulokhu.
Stop doing it.	Yeka ukukwenza.
Yes, you have talked about him before.	Yebo, uke wakhuluma ngaye ngaphambili.
But he doesn't want anything to do with her.	Kodwa akafuni lutho ngaye.
I wanted to play badly.	Ngangifuna ukudlala kabi.
You play with him.	Udlala ngaye.
We need to say just a few.	Sidinga ukusho ezimbalwa nje.
This sounds like it should be helpful.	Lokhu kuzwakala sengathi kufanele kube usizo.
It just had to.	Kwakufanele nje .
Every day we do what you want to do.	Nsuku zonke senza lokho ofuna ukukwenza.
And that is probably what happened here.	Futhi kungenzeka ukuthi yilokho okwenzeka lapha.
Hopefully not me.	Ngethemba hhayi mina.
And now someone is going to stay here.	Futhi manje omunye uzohlala lapha.
Everyone thinks you're here.	Wonke umuntu ucabanga ukuthi ulapha.
Yes, actually, yes.	Yebo, empeleni, yebo.
Not many times though.	Hhayi izikhathi eziningi noma kunjalo.
Or, don't do it.	Noma, ungakwenzi.
He just wants to see you.	Ufuna nje ukukubona.
So we have to go.	Ngakho kudingeka sihambe.
His mother, actually.	Umama wakhe, empeleni.
It's hard to see this happening.	Kunzima ukubona lokhu kwenzeka.
You want to say a lot of things, actually.	Ufuna ukusho izinto eziningi, empeleni.
Lots of problems with that.	Izinkinga eziningi ngalokho.
He opened another beer.	Wavula omunye ubhiya.
I doubt this.	Ngiyangabaza ngale nto.
No, not at all.	Cha, hhayi kangako.
How difficult it is for you to know that.	Kunzima kangakanani kuwe ukwazi lokho.
Pain, yes.	Ubuhlungu, yebo.
Probably, but not yet.	Cishe, kodwa hhayi okwamanje.
Something down there.	Okuthile phansi lapho.
And today.	Futhi namuhla.
Yes you do.	Yebo usho.
He went down.	Washona phansi.
I wanted everything for you to be better.	Bengifuna ukuthi konke kuwe kube ngcono.
I also apologize for that.	Nami ngiyaxolisa ngalokho.
He decided to take his time.	Wanquma ukuthatha isikhathi sakhe.
I have to say, for sure.	Kufanele ngisho, nakanjani.
But not alone.	Kodwa hhayi yedwa.
I'd like to come, too.	Ngingathanda ukuza, nami.
Now, or always.	Manje, noma njalo.
It needs to be done as soon as possible.	Kudingeka kwenziwe ngokushesha ngangokunokwenzeka.
Maybe it wasn’t even human.	Mhlawumbe kwakungeyena ngisho umuntu.
And he seemed very happy.	Futhi wayebonakala ejabule kakhulu.
But he had to know.	Kodwa kwakufanele azi.
I got help.	Ngithole usizo.
So off he went.	Ngakho waya ngakho.
Good, of course.	Enhle, kunjalo.
So let's make that easy to do.	Ngakho ake senze lokho kube lula ukwenza lokho.
So we did the same thing.	Ngakho senza into efanayo.
By the way yes.	Ngendlela yebo.
Everyone knew he was the best.	Wonke umuntu wayazi ukuthi ungcono kakhulu.
I've only done it once.	Ngikwenze kanye kuphela.
And when that happens, you know.	Futhi uma lokho kwenzeka, uyakwazi.
I need to finish the book.	Ngidinga ukuqeda incwadi.
But he said all of us.	Kodwa wathi sonke.
Bigger than that.	Okukhulu kunalokho.
But yes, it does.	Kodwa yebo, kwenzeka.
You need it so badly.	Udinga kakhulu.
Sounds like home sometimes.	Kuzwakala sengathi ekhaya ngezinye izikhathi.
You always think of other things.	Uhlale ucabanga ngezinye izinto.
Maybe someone in town.	Mhlawumbe othile edolobheni.
And as soon as necessary.	Futhi ngokushesha uma kudingeka.
I want to see his eyes again.	Ngifuna ukubona amehlo akhe futhi.
Probably a lot of people.	Mhlawumbe abantu abaningi.
My whole opinion is that we should do something.	Umbono wami wonke ukuthi kufanele senze okuthile.
I know you know all this.	Ngiyazi nawe uyakwazi konke lokhu.
So much more for you.	Okuningi okuningi kwakho.
And not man.	Futhi hhayi umuntu.
I stayed here for a while.	Ngihlale isikhashana lapha.
Not in your place at all.	Akukho endaweni yakho nhlobo.
Now not so much.	Manje hhayi kakhulu.
He always goes.	Uya njalo.
But man, anyway.	Kodwa umuntu, noma kunjalo.
I would like to go home for a bit.	Ngingathanda ukuya ekhaya kancane.
You know, this time.	Uyazi, lesi sikhathi.
You should have this !.	Kufanele ube nalokhu!.
He stays that way.	Uhlala kanjalo.
This is your umbrella.	Lesi isambulela sakho.
I tried to work.	Ngazama ukusebenza.
And that's not a vision, that's true.	Futhi lokho akuwona umbono, lokho kuyiqiniso.
It looks good to me but obviously not.	Kubukeka kulungile kimi kodwa ngokusobala akunjalo.
He just couldn't come.	Ubengeke nje akwazi ukuza.
This is your new person.	Umuntu wakho omusha lo.
But many choices.	Kodwa ukukhetha okuningi.
It's a bad idea, but you did it.	Umbono omubi, kodwa ukwenzile.
Outside, it is still obvious.	Ngaphandle, kusobala namanje.
I need to do better.	Ngidinga ukwenza kangcono.
Only not hard.	Kuphela hhayi kanzima.
This time he was afraid.	Kulokhu wayesaba.
Maybe something happened there.	Mhlawumbe kukhona okwenzekayo lapho.
No, not really.	Hhayi, impela.
Obviously, he was not.	Ngokusobala, wayengeyena.
But, how about next year.	Kodwa, kanjani ngonyaka ozayo.
He is a great and good man.	Ungumuntu omkhulu futhi omuhle.
That he had hope.	Ukuthi wayenethemba.
Anything at all.	Noma yini nhlobo.
I think you need money.	Ngicabanga ukuthi udinga imali.
We should have had that at school.	Kwakufanele sibe nakho lokho esikoleni.
His whole family.	Umndeni wakhe wonke.
Not enough reason.	Akusona isizathu esanele.
Just a little bit, thank you.	Kancane nje, ngiyabonga.
Yes, even me.	Yebo, ngisho nami.
I have to do this at least once again.	Kufanele ngenze lokhu okungenani kanye futhi.
There was not much he did not know.	Akukho okuningi lapho wayengazi.
So now.	Ngakho manje.
I didn't want to go to a party.	Ngangingafuni ukuya ephathini.
Not much, but maybe just enough.	Hhayi okuningi, kodwa mhlawumbe nje ngokwanele.
But again, it's his fault.	Kodwa futhi, iphutha lakhe.
So, obviously, something has to be done.	Ngakho, kusobala, kufanele kwenziwe okuthile.
He would not be alone.	Ubengeke abe yedwa.
Not immediately, of course.	Hhayi ngokushesha, kunjalo.
One looked up.	Omunye wabheka phezulu.
So you want these.	Ngakho ufuna lezi.
But really, there is.	Kodwa empeleni, kukhona.
You live outside, you work hard every day.	Uhlala ngaphandle, usebenza kanzima nsuku zonke.
Very good reason.	Isizathu esihle kakhulu.
So he pulled out.	Ngakho wakhipha.
Is that absolutely true.	Ingabe lokho kuyiqiniso ngokuphelele.
Please, do not do it.	Ngicela, ungakwenzi .
I just know I know.	Ngiyazi nje ngiyazi.
He will not want to talk about what happened.	Ngeke afune ukukhuluma ngokwenzekile.
Yes he can make more money than you.	Yebo angenza imali eningi kunawe.
Now, my chance.	Manje, ithuba lami.
It happened to you.	Kwenzeke kuwe.
I got a message last night.	Ngithole umlayezo izolo ebusuku.
He did not see.	Akazange abone.
I thought well of him for that.	Ngacabanga kahle ngaye ngalokho.
But power is not the answer.	Kodwa amandla akuyona impendulo.
But you want to be a better person.	Kodwa ufuna ukuba umuntu ongcono.
I know no one is good.	Ngiyazi ukuthi akekho omuhle.
Sounds like you're going too far too.	Kuzwakala sengathi uhamba kakhulu futhi.
He had to leave when he left.	Bekumele ahambe ngesikhathi ehamba.
He did more.	Wakwenza okwengeziwe.
He seemed unwilling to go on.	Wabonakala engafuni ukuqhubeka.
She did not know about him at the time.	Wayengazi ngaye ngaleso sikhathi.
Obviously this is very good.	Ngokusobala lokhu kulungile kakhulu.
And we need to hear this, too.	Futhi sidinga ukuzwa lokhu, futhi.
We got it all.	Sithole konke.
He thought as quickly as he could.	Wacabanga ngokushesha ngangokunokwenzeka.
I don't even know when.	Angazi nokuthi nini.
I'm sorry about this now.	Ngiyaxolisa ngalokhu manje.
So much for the whole day.	Kakhulu usuku lonke.
He should have wanted me to come.	Bekufanele afune ngize.
You know what, maybe not.	Uyazi ukuthini, mhlawumbe cha.
I still don't know much.	Namanje angazi okuningi.
I know a good boy like you.	Ngiyazi umfana omuhle njengawe.
Or all the other times.	Noma zonke ezinye izikhathi.
He fears the need.	Wesaba isidingo.
It would be a lie if it happened.	Kungaba amanga uma kwenzeka.
Or more of you.	Noma okuningi kwakho.
I don't know what to do in time.	Angazi ukuthi ngenzeni ngesikhathi.
This would be a bad idea.	Lokhu kungaba umqondo omubi.
The question is what to do.	Umbuzo uthi ngenzeni.
I saw in him.	Ngabona kuye.
I need something more.	Ngidinga okuthile okwengeziwe.
I do not understand why I.	Angiqondi ukuthi kungani mina.
Mary and I.	Mina noMary.
After, you know.	Ngemva, uyazi.
Good team, too.	Iqembu elihle, futhi.
It can be very easy to finish.	Kungaba lula kakhulu ukuqeda.
I think he can be up or down.	Ngicabanga ukuthi angaba phezulu noma phansi.
It will be so.	Uzoba njalo .
But not hard, or long.	Kodwa hhayi kanzima, noma isikhathi eside.
I think that's a very good idea.	Ngicabanga ukuthi umqondo omuhle kakhulu.
The boy is also doing well.	Umfana naye wenza kahle.
You know, you just want to be yourself.	Uyazi, ufuna nje ukuba nguwe.
He did a lot of this.	Wenza okuningi kakhulu ngalokhu.
It should be today.	Kufanele kube namuhla.
And that's all.	Futhi lokho kuphela.
Certainly not me !.	Impela akumina!.
He knows but he doesn't know what it is yet.	Uyazi kodwa akazi ukuthi yini okwamanje.
I found the same story.	Ngithole indaba efanayo.
I think you need to be with him.	Ngicabanga ukuthi udinga ukuba naye.
But it should not.	Kodwa akumele.
I don't like the house.	Angithandi endlini.
But for now, there is nothing you can do.	Kodwa njengamanje, akukho okumele ukwenze.
He did that later.	Wakwenza lokho kamuva.
Life with us.	Impilo nathi.
I didn't know much about it.	Ngangingazi okuningi ngayo.
I do not know the best way to do this.	Angazi indlela engcono kakhulu yokwenza lokhu.
But not really right now.	Kodwa hhayi ngempela njengamanje.
But because of me.	Kodwa ngenxa yami.
I think we can't do that.	Ngicabanga ukuthi ngeke sikwenze lokho.
He shouldn't either.	Naye akufanele.
Everyone there is everyone at once.	Wonke umuntu lapho kukhona wonke umuntu ngesikhathi esisodwa.
I thought so too.	Nami bengicabanga kanjalo .
You always go your own way, but not in this one.	Uhlale uhamba ngendlela yakho, kodwa hhayi kulokhu.
All his clothes.	Zonke izingubo zakhe.
You just want to take a picture.	Ufuna nje ukuthatha isithombe.
I live there for now.	Ngihlala khona okwamanje.
He said no one else in the car.	Wathi akekho omunye emotweni.
Right now to.	Njengamanje ukuze.
It’s not just something sometimes.	Akuyona nje into ngezinye izikhathi.
One friend spoke well of her.	Omunye umngane wakhuluma kahle ngaye.
There will be time for all that later.	Kuzoba nesikhathi sakho konke lokho kamuva.
He asked if this was okay.	Wabuza ukuthi lokhu kulungile.
Now or later.	Manje noma kamuva.
He will not go with her.	Ngeke ahambe naye.
I was not thinking about him.	Bengingacabangi ngaye.
And he couldn't do it.	Futhi akakwazanga ukuzenza.
You can probably make this look good.	Cishe ungakwenza lokhu kube kuhle.
I will do something.	Ngizokwenza okuthile.
Now stop talking and eat fast.	Manje yeka ukukhuluma futhi udle ngokushesha.
But you do not think much of it.	Kodwa awucabangi kakhulu ngale ndaba.
He looked much better.	Wayebonakala engcono kakhulu.
I'm sure you know about me.	Nginesiqiniseko sokuthi uyazi ngami.
Yes, a lot is happening there.	Yebo, kuningi okwenzekayo lapho.
Such a wonderful family.	Umndeni omuhle kangaka.
It's not my way.	Akuyona indlela yami.
He tried to stay.	Wazama ukuhlala.
I mean, it happens to all of us.	Ngisho ukuthi, kwenzeka kithi sonke.
I couldn't, really.	Angikwazanga, impela.
And, the same one.	Futhi, eyodwa efanayo.
First in time.	Okokuqala ngesikhathi.
Another meeting agreed.	Omunye umhlangano wavuma.
I think a lot of things.	Ngicabanga izinto eziningi.
But again, there is no need.	Kodwa futhi, asikho isidingo.
You talk about that, finally.	Ukhuluma nalokho, ekugcineni.
Dad loves you better than I do.	Ubaba uthanda wena kangcono kunami.
You probably can't.	Cishe awukwazi.
In this case, it could be a doctor.	Kulokhu, kungaba udokotela.
He wanted the same thing.	Naye wayefuna into efanayo.
And everyone wants power.	Futhi wonke umuntu ufuna amandla.
He probably doesn't like to talk about it.	Cishe akathandi ukukhuluma ngakho.
This is a problem for me and for myself.	Lena inkinga yami nami ngedwa.
But he is not really there.	Kodwa akekho ngempela lapho.
No one does anything for us.	Akekho owenza lutho kithi.
It's really hard, really, really.	Kunzima ngempela, ngempela, ngempela.
But if.	Kodwa uma .
You need to see the right approach.	Udinga ukubona indlela efanele.
I think a lot of you.	Ngicabanga kakhulu ngawe.
I really enjoy it.	Impela ngijabule ngayo.
Proper cycling.	Ukugibela ibhayisikili okufanele.
Still, that doesn't mean anything.	Noma kunjalo, lokho akusho lutho.
Maybe not for years.	Mhlawumbe hhayi iminyaka.
Tomorrow may be different.	Kusasa kungase kube okunye.
I just thought of the word yesterday.	Ngicabange nje igama izolo.
I would love to see what you do with it.	Ngingathanda ukubona ukuthi wenzani ngayo.
One thing too many.	Into eyodwa eziningi kakhulu.
I do not want to do this work.	Angifuni ukwenza lo msebenzi.
In fact, it did not.	Empeleni, akuzange kube njalo.
And maybe do your homework too.	Futhi mhlawumbe wenze umsebenzi wesikole futhi.
He talks about other things.	Ukhuluma ngezinye izinto.
And neither will we.	Futhi nathi ngeke.
Let's make food.	Ake senze ukudla.
So do I.	Nami futhi kunjalo.
Or rather someone.	Noma kunalokho othile.
I once wondered why.	Ngike ngacabanga ukuthi kungani.
This happened.	Lokhu kwenzeka.
Not so next weekend.	Ngeke kube njalo ngempelasonto ezayo.
And it can be hard to stop playing.	Futhi kungaba nzima ukuyeka ukudlala.
Another, small house.	Enye, indlu encane.
Not much is happening.	Akukho okuningi okwenzekayo.
She is all good.	Muhle konke.
You can do all this yourself.	Ungakwenza konke lokhu wena.
I want a good tv.	Ngifuna i-tv enhle.
House next year.	Indlu ngonyaka ozayo.
But for now, he has to stay.	Kodwa okwamanje, kufanele ahlale.
I did well there.	Ngenze kahle lapho.
He would not make this easy for her.	Wayengeke enze lokhu kube lula kuye.
So, again, here.	Ngakho, futhi, lapha.
And what a bad ride.	Futhi yeka ukugibela okubi.
He thought he would have to do it.	Wayecabanga ukuthi kuzofanele akwenze.
I want another word for it.	Ngifuna elinye igama ngakho.
And he thought.	Futhi wayecabanga.
I can't talk much now.	Angikwazi ukukhuluma kakhulu manje.
Music is always there.	Umculo uhlala ukhona.
That may need to be done.	Lokho kungase kudingeke kwenziwe.
Either way, everything is fine.	Noma iyiphi indlela, konke kuhle.
How much, he was not sure.	Kangakanani, wayengenaso isiqiniseko.
It might be good, actually.	Kungase kube kuhle, empeleni.
As you work with me.	Njengoba usebenza nami.
You have been with me so much.	Ube nami kakhulu.
He was not much of a father.	Wayengeyena ubaba kakhulu.
His mother died first.	Umama wakhe washona kuqala.
He walked alone.	Ahambe yedwa.
This would be a good thing.	Lokhu kungaba yinto enhle.
Like you or me.	Njengawe noma mina.
I'm happy for him anyway.	Ngijabule ngaye noma kunjalo.
And food, of course.	Futhi ukudla, kunjalo.
And he tried again.	Futhi wazama futhi.
He formed a group.	Wenze iqembu.
You will need it.	Uzodinga wena.
Right now, it's hard.	Njengamanje, kunzima.
I think it could be better.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kungaba ngcono.
But that is not our fault.	Kodwa akulona icala lethu.
And let me just tell you.	Futhi ake ngikutshele nje.
My mother, you know, died.	Umama, uyazi, washona.
I will go with this.	Ngizohamba nalokhu.
I want you too.	nami ngifuna wena.
Maybe you went a little further.	Mhlawumbe uhambe kancane.
Maybe if you talk a little really.	Mhlawumbe uma ukhuluma kancane ngempela.
I just don't want to be with you like that.	Angifuni nje ukuba nawe kanjalo.
You are better than you think.	Ungcono kunalokho ucabanga.
There is room for all of us at the table.	Kukhona indawo yethu sonke etafuleni.
I have no other choice.	Anginayo enye indlela.
He pulled out his gun.	Wakhipha isibhamu sakhe.
But in everything else.	Kodwa kukho konke okunye.
He tried with me again.	Wazama nami futhi.
We do things.	Senza izinto.
Always no, no.	Njalo cha, cha.
You have to stay here in the city.	Kuzomele uhlale lapha edolobheni.
If we do, that's fine.	Uma senza, kuhle lokho.
He will do what he has to do.	Uzokwenza okufanele akwenze.
The sooner it can be better.	Ngokushesha kungaba ngcono.
Or it could be an idea.	Noma kungaba umbono.
But only as you wish.	Kodwa kuphela njengoba ufisa.
And now you may want to be alone.	Futhi manje mhlawumbe ungathanda ukuba wedwa.
That he will never do.	Lokho akasoze akwenza.
That would be great !!!!!!!.	Lokho kungaba kuhle nje!!!!!!!.
I want you to find a picture of her.	Ngifuna uthole isithombe sakhe.
Or maybe in the evening.	Noma mhlawumbe kusihlwa.
I don't even have a house.	Anginayo ngisho indlu.
I need to get better right now.	Ngidinga ukuba ngcono okwamanje.
Our work and all that.	Umsebenzi wethu nakho konke lokho.
I thought it was okay.	Bengithi kulungile.
He must be good at it.	Kumele abe muhle kukho.
I would like to work now.	Ngingathanda ukusebenza manje.
Maybe he can.	Mhlawumbe angaba nakho.
I am so happy to have him at home.	Ngijabule kakhulu ukuba naye ekhaya.
He knows what to do.	Uyazi okufanele akwenze.
Hopefully soon.	Ngethemba maduze nje.
I wonder.	Ngiyazibuza .
And that is true, as it happens.	Futhi lokho kuyiqiniso, njengoba kwenzeka.
He thought he had done it.	Wayecabanga ukuthi ukwenzile.
There, there, now.	Lapho, lapho, manje.
He does everything.	Wenza zonke izinto.
Still, he is human.	Noma kunjalo, ungumuntu.
And he will not.	Futhi angeke.
Good job so far, by the way.	Umsebenzi omuhle kuze kube manje, ngendlela.
What's the matter with you? 	Yini inkinga ngawe?
I will never know a great man.	Angisoze ngazi umuntu omkhulu.
No one, really.	Akekho, ngempela.
But here's the truth.	Kodwa lapha kuyiqiniso.
The only problem is sleep.	Inkinga nje ukulala.
If it sounds, it's fine.	Uma kuzwakala, kuhle.
But that is not the case right now.	Kodwa akunjalo njengamanje.
He can do anything and everything.	Angenza noma yini nakho konke.
Finally the answer.	Ekugcineni impendulo.
Maybe it shouldn’t happen.	Mhlawumbe akufanele kwenzeke.
But just a little bit.	Kodwa kancane nje.
I did not want to.	Ngangingafuni kanjalo.
There is nothing wrong with that.	Akukho okubi kuye.
He says he knows he thinks everything well.	Uthi uyazi ukuthi ucabanga yonke into kahle.
But what's worse.	Kodwa yini embi.
You will probably come back again to find out more.	Cishe uzobuya futhi ukuze uthole okwengeziwe.
You need to know what is good and what is bad for you.	Kufanele wazi ukuthi yini enhle futhi embi kuwe.
It should, it should, it should.	Kufanele, kufanele, kufanele.
And sometimes.	Futhi ngezinye izikhathi .
It never was, really.	Akuzange kube, ngempela.
So, it's not really a problem.	Ngakho, akuyona inkinga ngempela.
But it will definitely happen soon.	Kodwa nakanjani kuzokwenzeka maduze nje.
My father would never do that.	Ubaba akasoze akwenza lokho.
It's not just our problem.	Akuyona nje inkinga yethu.
I think we did a good job.	Ngicabanga ukuthi senze umsebenzi omuhle.
You will be beautiful to him.	Uzoba muhle kuye.
It must be visible.	Kumele abonakale.
As needed.	Njengoba kwakudingeka.
I know all about that, thank you very much.	Ngazi konke ngalokho, ngiyabonga kakhulu.
And you told everyone about it.	Futhi utshele wonke umuntu ngakho.
But please find another way to do it.	Kodwa ngicela uthole enye indlela yokwenza.
Just a few things.	Izinto ezimbalwa nje.
This sounds good to me.	Lokhu kuzwakala kulungile kimi.
And to know yourself.	Futhi ukwazi wena.
As it is, tomorrow morning.	Njengoba kunjalo, kusasa ekuseni.
He decided to talk.	Wanquma ukukhuluma.
I just wanted something good.	Bengifuna nje into enhle.
He did not want to get into it until now.	Wayengafuni ukungena kukho kuze kube manje.
I want one right now.	Ngifuna eyodwa njengamanje.
I can't get out of here.	Angikwazi ukuphuma lapha.
I did not want this to happen.	Ngangingafuni lokhu kwenzeke.
But that is not our story.	Kodwa lokho akuyona indaba yethu.
He arrived yesterday.	Ufike izolo.
I mean there is no such thing.	Ngisho ukuthi ayikho into enjalo.
The whole idea seems wrong.	Wonke umqondo ubonakala unephutha.
It's too late for class.	Sekwephuzile ekilasini.
You know you will get to it in the end.	Uyazi ukuthi uzofika kukho ekugcineni.
He often slept through the night.	Wayevame ukulala ebusuku.
I did then, and always.	Ngenza ngaleso sikhathi, futhi njalo.
I blame my mother.	Ngisola umama wami.
And finally, the same thing with us.	Futhi ekugcineni, into efanayo nathi.
Now but that's it now.	Manje kodwa lokho manje.
You will live in a new house.	Uzohlala endlini entsha.
And he's down there too.	Futhi naye phansi phansi lapho.
He just couldn't see it.	Akakwazanga nje ukukubona.
This would be great here.	Lokhu kungaba kuhle lapha.
Cooking food is hard.	Ukupheka ukudla kunzima.
I am not his father.	Angiyena ubaba wakhe.
And, maybe there is a better way.	Futhi, mhlawumbe kukhona indlela engcono.
You are skilled enough.	Unekhono ngokwanele.
But he still tried to do so.	Kodwa noma kunjalo wazama ukwenza kanjalo.
I wanted to have it all.	Bengifuna ukuba nakho konke.
No, he would not.	Cha, naye ubengeke.
He may not say so, but you know.	Ngeke asho njalo, kodwa uyazi.
You certainly know about me.	Impela uyazi ngami.
Not that it would be a bad thing.	Hhayi ukuthi kungaba yinto embi.
He may even be helpful.	Angase abe usizo ngisho.
There is nothing more to be done.	Akukho okunye okumele kwenziwe.
Or even a friend.	Noma ngisho umngane.
Is it true.	Ingabe kuyiqiniso.
You need to find your son immediately.	Udinga ukuthola indodana yakho ngokushesha.
It could be you !.	Kungaba uwena!.
This is life, it is me.	Impilo lena, yimina.
Slowly, maybe.	Kancane, mhlawumbe.
He was not a man at all.	Wayengeyena nhlobo umuntu.
But he talks a lot.	Kodwa ukhuluma kakhulu.
Opportunity would be a good thing.	Ithuba kungaba yinto enhle.
I don't see any help in that.	Angiboni nhlobo usizo kulokho.
Come to him a little.	Eze kuye kancane.
Here I am.	Lapha nami.
It has to be, actually.	Kufanele kube, empeleni.
This is not true, of course.	Lokhu akulona iqiniso, kunjalo.
It's hard for him, at school.	Kunzima kuye, esikoleni.
He loves to talk, but only about himself.	Uthanda ukukhuluma, kodwa ngaye kuphela.
He wanted to sleep for a week.	Wayefuna ukulala isonto lonke.
As it happened, something happened.	Njengoba kwenzeka, kukhona okwenzekile.
But we will not be here then.	Kodwa ngeke sibe lapha ngaleso sikhathi.
Now, there is.	Manje, kukhona.
It should have been me, not him.	Bekufanele kube yimi, hhayi yena.
Maybe, and maybe not.	Mhlawumbe, futhi mhlawumbe akunjalo.
Actually possible, he realized.	Empeleni kungenzeka, waqaphela.
You know what good it is.	Uyazi ukuthi kuhle ngani.
Beer is all beer.	Ubhiya wonke ubhiya.
I want to see my children.	Ngifuna ukubona izingane zami.
Her family wants to go home.	Umndeni wakhe ufuna ukuya ekhaya.
I would not have done it without him.	Bengingeke ngikwenze ngaphandle kwakhe.
Photo, maybe.	Isithombe, mhlawumbe.
You are playing well now.	Udlala kahle manje.
But she may not know that.	Kodwa kungenzeka ukuthi akakwazi lokho.
I want you to be my father.	Ngifuna ube ubaba wami.
He said yes he is.	Wathi yebo ukhona.
So small.	Encane kanjalo.
I don't know what's going on here.	Angazi ukuthi kwenzekani lapha.
Thank you everyone, thank you.	Ngiyabonga wonke umuntu, ngiyabonga.
But now it seems.	Kodwa manje kubonakala kunjalo.
I can no longer drink like that.	Angisakwazi ukuphuza kanjalo.
And he wasn't that at all.	Futhi wayengeyena nhlobo lowo.
Or, instead, it will be.	Noma, kunalokho, kuzoba khona.
I tried to be really good.	Ngazama ukuba muhle ngempela.
I thought that was okay.	Bengicabanga ukuthi lokho kulungile.
Or he may be alone.	Noma angase ahlale eyedwa.
The view is really good.	Umbono muhle ngempela.
Anyone would, really.	Noma ubani ngabe, ngempela.
I don’t know why right now, anyone.	Angazi ukuthi kungani okwamanje, noma ubani.
Flowers on the bed.	Izimbali embhedeni.
You have been to the hospital.	Uke waya esibhedlela.
He did not see anyone there.	Akazange abone muntu lapho.
And to get out.	Futhi ukuphuma.
But it will take time to work.	Kodwa kuzothatha isikhathi ukusebenza.
It will not be someone else.	Ngeke kube omunye umuntu.
No, he is not at the door.	Cha, akekho emnyango.
And right now, obviously almost everyone will.	Futhi njengamanje, ngokusobala cishe wonke umuntu uzokwenza.
But he did not want to be there with her.	Kodwa wayengafuni ukuba lapho naye.
He told another.	Watshela omunye.
Apparently he just refused to make the place.	Ngokusobala nje wenqaba ukwenza indawo.
He didn't think at all.	Akazange acabange nhlobo.
Certainly this.	Impela lokhu.
He’s such a good player.	Ungumdlali omuhle kanjalo.
And, just my opinion.	Futhi, umbono wami kuphela.
You can walk a little bit on it.	Ungakwazi ukuhamba kancane kukho.
But this is not death.	Kodwa lokhu akukhona ukufa.
But still nothing happens.	Kodwa noma kunjalo akukho okwenzekayo.
At his age.	Ngeminyaka yakhe.
There will be a moment.	Kuzoba khona isikhashana.
Thank you no.	Ngiyabonga cha.
Absolutely necessary.	Kudingeka ngokuphelele.
Or some of you, though.	Noma okunye kwakho, noma kunjalo.
He talks a little bit about that.	Ukhuluma kancane ngalokho.
He refused to have sex with her.	Wenqaba ukulala naye.
And not the other way around.	Futhi hhayi okunye.
It is not lunch.	Akusona isidlo sasemini.
Food to think about, maybe ?.	Ukudla ukucabanga, mhlawumbe?.
Obviously this is.	Ngokusobala lena.
We make friends easier.	Senza abangani lula.
It was not that he wanted to live.	Akukhona ukuthi wayefuna ukuphila.
Every day he just wanted to cry.	Nsuku zonke wayefuna nje ukukhala.
Not tomorrow, now.	Hhayi kusasa, manje.
With him, or with him alone.	Naye, noma naye kuphela.
But today something is happening all the time.	Kodwa namuhla kukhona okwenzeka njalo.
He certainly should have done this years ago.	Impela bekufanele akwenze lokhu eminyakeni edlule.
But he said something else.	Kodwa usho okunye.
But his eyes.	Kodwa amehlo akhe .
I always know.	Ngiyazi njalo.
He always has to do something.	Ngaso sonke isikhathi kufanele enze okuthile.
Thinking is real.	Ukucabanga kuyiqiniso.
Thank you very much, but no.	Ngiyabonga kakhulu, kodwa cha.
Whether going up or down.	Ukuthi ukuya phezulu noma phansi.
I am really happy with this book.	Impela ngijabule ngale ncwadi.

Dad doesn't know anything about it.	Ubaba akazi lutho ngakho.
I can't stop drinking water.	Angikwazi ukuyeka ukuphuza amanzi.
No, he could not.	Cha, akakwazanga ukucabanga kanjalo.
Going to jail.	Ukuya ejele.
I don't know, maybe.	Angazi, mhlawumbe.
I should never be here.	Akufanele neze ngibe lapha.
As you say.	Njengoba usho .
But that is not a job for me.	Kodwa lokho akuwona umsebenzi kimi.
Just learning things.	Ukufunda izinto nje.
And is this all? 	Futhi ingabe konke lokhu?
At first, she thought he was a friend.	Ekuqaleni, wayecabanga ukuthi umngane.
I did not want to leave at that time.	Ngangingafuni ukuhamba ngaleso sikhathi.
I know some, too.	Ngiyazi ngezinye, futhi.
He stayed the whole time.	Wahlala sonke isikhathi.
If you do, please mention my name.	Uma wenza kanjalo, ngicela usho igama lami.
A little bit of it all, really.	Kancane kancane kwakho konke, ngempela.
I think he should go.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kufanele ahambe.
Yes, now you can.	Yebo, manje ungakwazi.
I never found anything for you.	Angikaze ngithole lutho lwakho.
And so one.	Futhi kanjalo eyodwa.
Is it possible to do that.	Kungenzeka yini ukwenza lokho.
That is why testing is needed.	Yingakho kudingeka ukuhlolwa.
So we made the job easier.	Ngakho senze umsebenzi waba lula.
Sure, he should know.	Impela, kufanele akwazi.
None of this really happened to you.	Akukho kulokhu okwenzeka kuwe ngempela.
It was clear he would not.	Kwacaca ukuthi ngeke.
Her children.	Izingane zakhe.
But, this is true.	Kodwa, lokhu kuyiqiniso.
I need to be very alone.	Ngidinga ukuba ngedwa kakhulu.
Well done, but also.	Wenze kahle, kodwa futhi.
I wish just once.	Ngifisa kube kanye nje .
But he finally realized that he needed to talk.	Kodwa ekugcineni wabona ukuthi kufanele akhulume.
And he did a great job.	Futhi wenze umsebenzi omkhulu.
My mother is sitting on the bed.	Umama uhlezi embhedeni.
And that he did a good job.	Nokuthi wenza umsebenzi omuhle.
There is work to be done.	Ukhona umsebenzi.
That's your money and mine.	Imali yakho nami leyo.
It’s not always a problem, but it can be.	Akuyona inkinga njalo, kodwa kungaba njalo.
Not to buy.	Hhayi ukuthenga.
But you will need to talk to him.	Kodwa uzodinga ukukhuluma naye.
I did the right thing.	Ngenza okufanele.
He should think that all of this is true.	Kufanele acabange ukuthi konke lokhu kuyiqiniso.
He saw that she was afraid.	Wabona ukuthi uyesaba.
Something has been done.	Kwenziwe okuthile .
You have to do it, he used to say.	Kufanele ukwenze, wayevame ukusho.
I'm glad to hear that I'm not alone.	Ngiyajabula ukuzwa ukuthi akumina ngedwa.

Thank you so much for the time.	Ngiyabonga kakhulu ngesikhathi.
Still no money.	Noma kunjalo ayikho imali.
He opened another door.	Wavula omunye umnyango.
Only when we get down.	Kuphela lapho sifika phansi.
So, you should be happy.	Ngakho, kufanele ujabule.
When you need it.	Lapho udinga.
You can't say which one makes the sound.	Awukwazi ukusho ukuthi iyiphi eyenza umsindo.
Another was wearing his hat.	Omunye wayegqoke isigqoko sakhe.
It's not just a big problem.	Akuyona nje inkinga enkulu.
In this case, he did not.	Kulokhu, akazange enze kanjalo.
You found this restaurant.	Uthole le ndawo yokudlela.
He never really went to school.	Akazange ngempela aye esikoleni.
At least, not here.	Okungenani, hhayi lapha.
Everything is almost perfect.	Konke cishe kuhle kakhulu.
You will need one, too.	Uzodinga eyodwa, futhi.
He thought, maybe that's the best.	Wacabanga, mhlawumbe lokho kungcono kakhulu.
But nothing later.	Kodwa lutho ngemva.
It's a little hard.	Kunzima kancane.
You will find nothing in us.	Ngeke uthole lutho kithi.
There can be really many things.	Kungaba izinto eziningi ngempela.
At least, help me.	Okungenani, ngisize.
I felt bad, of course.	Ngezwa kabi, kunjalo.
Not that.	Hhayi leyo nto.
You don't think about that.	Awucabangi ngalokho.
But, we can never stop.	Kodwa, asikwazi neze ukuyeka.
It will be much easier for you.	Kuzoba lula kakhulu kuwe.
He can do this for hours.	Angakwenza lokhu amahora amaningi.
I could not see this.	Angikwazanga ukukubona lokhu.
So, you know everything.	Ngakho, wazi konke.
You should stay close to me now.	Kufanele uhlale eduze kwami ​​manje.
Said the man.	Wathi umuntu.
It is not just a name.	Akulona nje igama nje.
Instead it is a mistake.	Kunalokho iphutha.
Lots of people, lots of people here.	Abantu abaningi, abaningi lapha.
She wanted to go home to the bathroom.	Wayefuna ukuya ekhaya endlini encane.
Tell me just one thing.	Ngitshele into eyodwa nje.
I'm happy about it so far.	Ngijabule ngakho kuze kube manje.
I have not seen alcohol abuse.	Angizange ngibone ukuphuza ngokweqile.
No one, but no one.	Akekho, kodwa akekho.
In between.	Phakathi .
I thought this way.	Ngicabange ngale ndlela.
Not so with me.	Nami akunjalo.
A lot is just better.	Okuningi kungcono nje.
Everyone wanted to play.	Wonke umuntu wayefuna ukudlala.
It should not happen.	Akumele kwenzeke.
Walking into the house.	Ehamba endlini.
Is this the right way ?.	Ingabe indlela efanele lena?.
Maybe you're worried, too.	Mhlawumbe ukhathazekile, futhi.
Not one time.	Asikho isikhathi esisodwa.
I always want to learn or do something.	Ngihlale ngifuna ukufunda noma ukwenza okuthile.
He had never done that before.	Akakaze akwenze lokho ngaphambilini.
At least he may have it.	Okungenani angase abe nakho.
Lunch, too.	Ukudla kwasemini, futhi.
I sit down like this.	Ngihlala phansi kanje.
My mother struggled.	Umama wathola kanzima.
I would like to know the best way to do this.	Ngingathanda ukwazi indlela engcono kakhulu yokwenza lokhu.
And with whom.	Futhi nobani.
Hopefully that will be tomorrow.	Ngethemba ukuthi kuzoba kusasa lokho.
I also arrived on time.	Nami ngifike ngesikhathi.
No, that is not true either.	Cha, akulona iqiniso nalokho.
Exactly how it all happened.	Impela ukuthi konke kwenzeke kanjani.
He did not eat much at that time.	Akazange adle kancane ngaleso sikhathi.
You really want to play.	Impela ufuna ukudlala.
And you did everything right.	Futhi wenze konke kahle.
But most of the time.	Kodwa isikhathi esiningi.
He saw that he knew nothing.	Wabona ukuthi akazi lutho.
Maybe just three.	Mhlawumbe ezintathu nje.
Almost everyone does.	Cishe wonke umuntu wenza kanjalo.
This here.	Lokhu lapha.
And there is truth in this.	Futhi kukhona iqiniso kulokhu.
You need to go with me.	Udinga ukuhamba nami.

You do not want to get married again.	Awufuni ukushada futhi .

Everyone goes there.	Wonke umuntu uya lapho.
When you can.	Lapho ungakwazi.
But if you're scared, you don't need to play here.	Kodwa uma wesaba, awudingi ukudlala lapha.
She sat down and began to cry.	Wahlala phansi waqala ukukhala.
Or something in between.	Noma okuthile phakathi.
I want to learn as much as I can.	Ngifuna ukufunda okuningi ngangokunokwenzeka.
It's been there all along.	Kade kukhona isikhathi sonke.
Indeed, he did.	Ngempela, wakwenza.
You are always here.	Uhlala ulapha.
As soon as.	Ngokushesha uma.
You would not find almost anything happening to you.	Ubungeke uthole cishe lutho okwenzekayo kuwe.
Therefore, you need a job.	Ngalokho, udinga umsebenzi.
To do, to do, to do.	Ukwenza, ukwenza, ukwenza.
But only slightly.	Kodwa kuphela kancane.
Slowly but often.	Kancane kodwa kaningi.
It certainly looks better now.	Impela kubukeka kungcono manje.
He needs to do that over and over again.	Kudingeka akwenze lokho kaningi.
As we need that.	Njengoba sidinga lokho.
It is not a problem of yes or no.	Akuyona inkinga yebo noma cha.
You would say nothing to him.	Ubungeke usho lutho kuye.
He had to go now.	Bekumele ahambe manje.
I do not see the ground.	Angiboni phansi.
However, that is not our problem right now.	Noma kunjalo, leyo akuyona inkinga yethu njengamanje.
I wanted to know this.	Bengifuna ukwazi lokhu.
I don’t want to think or talk about it.	Angifuni ukucabanga noma ukukhuluma ngakho.
She took the baby.	Wathatha ingane.
It certainly seems that way to me.	Impela kubonakala kanjalo kimi.
She feels very lonely.	Uzizwa eyedwa kakhulu.
My correction.	Ukulungisa kwami.
He got it.	Wathola.
The question is why there ?.	Umbuzo uthi kungani lapho?.
We can't go through it.	Asikwazi ukuhamba ngayo.
There is nothing here yet.	Akukho lutho lapha okwamanje.
But only him.	Kodwa naye kuphela.
At least some of you are.	Okungenani okunye kwakho kunjalo.
Yet that is my hope.	Noma kunjalo ithemba lami lelo.
That is not true, at least not now.	Lokho akulona iqiniso, okungenani, hhayi manje.
There is no other house.	Ayikho enye indlu.
He could not sleep.	Wayengeke akwazi ukulala.
He always does this.	Uhlala wenza kanje.
That is not one of us.	Lokho akuyena omunye wethu.
I think this might be a problem in the end.	Ngicabanga ukuthi lokhu kungase kube inkinga ekugcineni.
My whole house.	Indlu yami yonke.
So think a little.	Ngakho ucabanga kancane.
So, that's fine.	Ngakho, lokho kulungile.
We do this problem.	Senza le nkinga kanje.
Maybe not then, but now.	Mhlawumbe hhayi ngaleso sikhathi, kodwa manje.
It's hard every day.	Kunzima nsuku zonke.
My mother can't.	Umama akakwazi.
He did not think it was just beer.	Wayengacabangi ukuthi ubhiya kuphela.
He did not have to go anywhere.	Kwakungadingeki aye ndawo.
I can't do that in the bathroom.	Angikwazi ukwenza lokho endlini encane.
And he had to do it alone.	Futhi kwakudingeka akwenze yedwa.
It has actually been good for all of us.	Empeleni kube kuhle kithi sonke.
And so he says yes.	Futhi ngakho uthi yebo.
It can be very helpful to us.	Kungaba usizo kakhulu kithi.
You do not know what he can do.	Awazi ukuthi yini akwazi ukuyenza.
Then the truth.	Khona iqiniso.
Not to think, but to do.	Akukhona ukucabanga, kodwa ukwenza.
This work is excellent.	Lo msebenzi muhle kakhulu.
I want to hear your story and everything.	Ngifuna ukuzwa indaba yakho nakho konke.
He would not have gotten anywhere without me.	Wayengeke afike ndawo ngaphandle kwami.
He didn't want to, but he did do it anyway.	Wayengafuni, kodwa wenza noma kunjalo.
And that is no small feat.	Futhi lokho akukhona kancane.
You have never done this before.	Awuzange ukwenze kanje ngaphambilini.
One too many shots, he thought.	Isibhamu esisodwa esiningi kakhulu, wayecabanga.
He can be alone.	Angaba yedwa.
I can't be without him.	Angeke ngikwazi ukuba ngaphandle kwakhe.
I feel pain, he thought.	Ngizwa ubuhlungu, wacabanga.
So please do.	Ngakho ngicela wenze.
It happens when it happens.	Kwenzeka uma kwenzeka.
I wonder where this is happening again.	Ngiyazibuza ukuthi lokhu kwenzeka kuphi futhi.
I don't want to know anything.	Angifuni ukwazi lutho.
No, not if, when.	Cha, hhayi uma, nini.
I want him to know this.	Ngifuna akwazi lokhu.
I couldn't see much.	Angikwazanga ukubona okuningi.
I need a lot of sleep.	Ngidinga ukulala kakhulu.
But that is not all we have to do.	Kodwa akukhona lokho kuphela okufanele sikwenze.
I didn't think I should.	Bengingacabangi ukuthi kufanele.
Not always.	Akunjalo njalo.
And have a good time.	Futhi ube nesikhathi esihle.
Maybe he didn't really know why.	Mhlawumbe wayengazi ngempela ukuthi kungani.
In this case, there is no alternative.	Kulokhu, ayikho enye indlela enjalo.
I got to do my own thing.	Ngithole ukwenza izinto zami.
I think we did this over the weekend.	Ngicabanga ukuthi sikwenze lokhu ngempelasonto.
Maybe he also knew but didn't want to know.	Mhlawumbe naye wayazi kodwa engafuni ukwazi.
This is it.	Lokhu yilokho.
It can be hard to fall asleep tonight.	Kungase kube nzima ukulala namhlanje kusihlwa.
Not now though.	Hhayi manje kodwa.
My mother asked for water.	Umama wacela amanzi.
I still can't do this.	Angikwazi noma kunjalo ukwenza lokhu.
We made to sit down.	Senza ukuhlala phansi.
A few days, up.	Izinsuku ezimbalwa, phezulu.
The truth of the matter.	Iqiniso kulokhu.
I did not want to go out at all.	Ngangingafuni nhlobo ukuphuma.
There is another car.	Kukhona enye imoto.
There is a mother, of course.	Ukhona umama, kunjalo.
Someone is always talking.	Umuntu uhlezi ekhuluma.
But it is really difficult.	Kodwa kunzima ngempela.

He hoped he would return.	Wayenethemba lokuthi uzobuya.
It's just that everything has to happen fast.	Ukuthi nje konke kufanele kwenzeke ngokushesha.

He says he wants to stay with me.	Uthi ufuna ukuhlala nami.
That he wanted to spend time with me.	Ukuthi wayefuna ukuchitha isikhathi nami.
He did not want to get there.	Wayengafuni ukufika lapho.

I heard about him, too.	Ngezwa ngaye, futhi.
To get here.	Ukuze ufike lapha.
We don't have to do it.	Akudingekile ukuba sikwenze.
You can do it today.	Ungakwenza namuhla.
Good job on all of this.	Umsebenzi omuhle kukho konke lokhu.
He is a very good person to work with.	Ungumuntu omuhle kakhulu ukusebenza naye.
But you are not.	Kodwa wena awuyena.

He would not do this.	Wayengeke akwenze lokhu.
She can be beautiful if she is not.	Angaba muhle uma engekho.
No, of course not!	Cha, impela, akufanele ahambe.
There is only now.	Kukhona kuphela manje.
There is nothing wrong with having a good cry when you feel that way.	Akukho okubi ukukhala uma uzizwa kanjalo.

Or a few times.	Noma izikhathi ezimbalwa.
I did not know better.	Ngangingazi kangcono.
He wasn't sure he wanted to know.	Wayengenaso isiqiniseko sokuthi ufuna ukwazi.
No he did not.	Cha wakhuluma.
The question is who is the worst.	Umbuzo uthi ubani omubi kakhulu.
He must be a father or a mother.	Kumele abe ubaba noma umama.
I thought for a long time so hard.	Ngacabanga isikhathi eside ngakho kanzima.
You will be really busy.	Uzoba matasa ngempela.
A gun, he thought.	Isibhamu, wacabanga.
He was probably not there now.	Cishe wayengekho manje.

He wants you alone.	Ufuna wena yedwa.
But very beautiful.	Kodwa enhle kakhulu.
I know you want to see your mother.	Ngiyazi ufuna ukubona umama wakho.
I would love anything.	Ngingathanda noma yini.

It's actually better.	Empeleni kungcono.
No, he wanted to go with her.	Cha, wayefuna ahambe naye.

That looks good to me.	Lokho kubukeka kulungile kimi.
We should all do this.	Kufanele sonke sikwenze lokhu.

Little by little, but he did.	Kancane kancane, kodwa wakwenza.
My mother is very talented, of course.	Umama unekhono kakhulu, kunjalo.
In my home.	Ekhaya lami.
No, it will not happen to me.	Cha, ngeke kwenzeke kimi.
He obviously wanted to talk.	Ngokusobala wayefuna ukukhuluma.

There had to be someone at the party.	Bekumele kube khona umuntu ephathini.
You need to get out of this.	Udinga ukuphuma kulokhu.

So you think about it.	Ngakho ucabanga ngakho.
Or next week.	Noma ngesonto elizayo.

And we need another way.	Futhi sidinga enye indlela.
I would love to see you again.	Ngingathanda ukukubona futhi.
Very well done now, if possible.	Kwenziwe kahle kakhulu manje, uma kungenzeka.

We should do it soon.	Kufanele sikwenze maduze.
He is someone you should know about.	Ungumuntu okufanele wazi ngaye.
I'm sure it's true.	Ngiqinisekile kuyiqiniso.
He said there was a noise.	Uthe kuzwakala umsindo.
Not everyone does this.	Akuwona wonke umuntu owenza lokhu.
And he certainly wouldn't do it now.	Futhi impela ubengeke akwenze manje.

I'm sure about that though.	Ngiqinisekile ngalokho noma kunjalo.
I know a lot better.	Ngiyazi okuningi kungcono.
But death is not all.	Kodwa ukufa akukhona konke.
Or, of course, not at all.	Noma, kunjalo, nhlobo.
No one wants to die like that.	Akekho ofuna ukufa kanjalo .
It is true, but it is not really true.	Kuyiqiniso, kodwa akulona iqiniso ngempela.
I wanted to buy something.	Bengifuna ukuthenga okuthile.
You always plan something.	Njalo uhlela okuthile.
Right now.	Manje manje.
We know what happened.	Siyazi ukuthi kwenzakalani.
Outside.	Nje .
Do you think that.	Ingabe ukucabanga kwakho lokho.
But that person! 	Kodwa lowo muntu!
I was too scared to take my bike.	Ngesaba kakhulu ukuthatha ibhayisikili lami.
Your great hope.	Ithemba lakho elikhulu.
That was some 30 years ago.	Lokho kwenzeka cishe eminyakeni engamashumi amathathu edlule.
And if, by saying,.	Futhi uma, ngokuthi, .
Still, he had to do it.	Noma kunjalo, kwakudingeka akwenze.
Not for a few years.	Hhayi ngeminyaka embalwa.
This should not happen immediately.	Lokhu akufanele kwenzeke ngokushesha.
He thought he felt this way.	Wayecabanga ukuthi uzizwa ngale ndlela.
Yes, that would be great.	Yebo, kungaba kuhle lokho.
You will be looking for dinner.	Uzobe ufuna isidlo sakusihlwa.

He wanted to be human.	Wayefuna ukuba umuntu.
I'll be in my room.	Ngizoba ekamelweni lami.
And that is a very bad thing.	Futhi leyo yinto embi kakhulu.
How helpful it can be.	Kungaba usizo kangakanani.
He walked to his car.	Ahambe eya emotweni yakhe.

I don't know who he knew.	Angazi ukuthi wayazi bani.
He could not have done better.	Wayengeke enze kangcono.
He wondered.	Wazibuza.
I saw it often enough.	Ngabona kaningi ngokwanele.
No, we will not go there.	Cha, ngeke siye lapho.
There is nothing there, really.	Akukho lutho lapho, ngempela.
It has to come before.	Kufanele kuze ngaphambili.
Not really, but not so much.	Akunjalo ngempela, kodwa hhayi kakhulu.
And how good it would be if he did one.	Futhi kungaba kuhle kanjani uma enza eyodwa.
Where he does not want anyone to go.	Lapho engafuni muntu aye khona.
He got along well with her.	Wahlala naye kahle.
He used to do that, too.	Wayevame ukwenza lokho, futhi.
But it could be just you.	Kodwa kungase kube uwena nje.
It is not my story why he wants so many.	Ayikho indaba yami ukuthi kungani efuna abaningi kangaka.
At least a week.	Okungenani isonto lonke.
I saw this this afternoon.	Ngibone lokhu ntambama.
Almost none.	Cishe akekho.
Throughout his life.	Kukho konke ukuphila kwakhe.
She always looks happy and cheerful.	Uhlala ebonakala ejabule futhi ejabule.
Sometimes, we want this to happen.	Ngezinye izikhathi, sifuna lokhu kwenzeke.
And we have been here for a long time.	Futhi sekunesikhathi eside sifika.
One always works.	Omunye uhlala usebenza.
Yes, yes, it is.	Yebo, yebo, kunjalo impela.
But to do that we need to do it right.	Kodwa ukuze senze lokho kudingeka sikwenze ngendlela efanele.
Absolutely good, a lot of you.	Kuhle ngokuphelele, okuningi kwakho.
This is not a new story.	Lena akuyona indaba entsha.
Life is not just work.	Impilo akuwona umsebenzi nje.
Not very true.	Akulona iqiniso kakhulu.
And maybe that's what should happen.	Futhi mhlawumbe yilokho okufanele kwenzeke.
Not all your fault.	Akulona iphutha lakho lonke.
I have never been so happy to go home.	Angikaze ngijabule kanje ukuya ekhaya.
Well, that's not all the truth.	Kulungile, akulona iqiniso lonke lelo.
You will not have to do anything.	Ngeke kudingeke wenze lutho .
But he does not know everything.	Kodwa akazi konke.
Not that you would like.	Hhayi ukuthi ungathanda.
It's the same thing.	Yinto efanayo.
I think he probably knew.	Ngicabanga ukuthi kungenzeka ukuthi wayazi.
This is a good time.	Isikhathi esihle lesi.
It just can't be done.	Ngeke nje kwenziwe.
That's just my job.	Umsebenzi wami nje lowo.
Family, family, family.	Umndeni, umndeni, umndeni.
I always wanted to make new music.	Ngihlale ngifuna ukwenza umculo omusha.
Not so much, of course.	Hhayi kakhulu, kunjalo.
He reached the top.	Ufike phezulu.
That he will go all the way.	Ukuthi uzohamba yonke leyo ndlela.
I want everything else.	Ngifuna konke okunye.
This is my problem.	Inkinga yami lena .
He also knew better than that.	Naye wayazi kangcono kunalokho.
He just wants his mother.	Ufuna umama wakhe nje.
And danger.	Futhi ingozi.
So we make it easy.	Ngakho senza kube lula.
But he can't stop thinking.	Kodwa akakwazi ukuyeka ukucabanga.
Not so much, but it is possible.	Akunjalo kakhulu, kodwa kungenzeka.
Your whole soul.	Umoya wakho wonke.
It would be better without him, though.	Kuzoba ngcono ngaphandle kwakhe, noma kunjalo.
But also danger.	Kodwa futhi ingozi.
Probably, too much.	Mhlawumbe, kuningi kakhulu.
And he says more.	Futhi usho okwengeziwe.
Slowly, like that.	Kancane, kanjalo.
I thought for a long time, hard.	Ngicabange isikhathi eside, kanzima.
He should have told me the first time it happened.	Bekufanele angitshele okokuqala kwenzeka.
And he told me, no.	Futhi wangitshela, cha.
You should eat a lot of dinner.	Kufanele udle kakhulu isidlo sakusihlwa.
You must be trying to get the police here.	Kumele ngabe uzama ukuthola amaphoyisa lapha.
Anyway, I just thought you might want to know.	Noma kunjalo, ngicabange nje ukuthi ungathanda ukwazi.
But that's right, that's right.	Kodwa kunjalo, kunjalo.
And to see if there is a fix.	Futhi ukubona ukuthi kukhona yini ukulungisa.
But the idea is that it will not be.	Kodwa umbono ukuthi ngeke abe.
And sometimes, death.	Futhi ngezinye izikhathi, ukufa.
I can't finish the book.	Angikwazi ukuqeda incwadi.
I mean we did.	Ngisho ukuthi senze.
He could not speak at this time.	Akakwazanga ukukhuluma njengamanje.
How much he knew.	Ukuthi wayazi kangakanani.
He did not know how and why this happened.	Wayengazi ukuthi kwenzeke kanjani futhi kungani lokhu kwenzeka.
But you can.	Kodwa ungakwazi.
Because it will take a lot.	Ngoba kuzothatha okuningi.
But not much more.	Kodwa hhayi okuningi okwengeziwe.
I will never, never will, never again.	Ngeke ngiphinde, ngeke ngiphinde, ngeke ngiphinde.
He walked into the restaurant.	Wangena endaweni yokudlela.
This is always good advice.	Lesi iseluleko esihle ngaso sonke isikhathi.
We know why you are here.	Siyazi ukuthi kungani ulapha.
Bad city.	Umuzi omubi.
I'm glad it should be.	Ngiyajabula ngokuthi kufanele kube njalo.
Hopefully, he was not.	Ngethemba, wayengekho.
Everyone should do it every day.	Wonke umuntu kufanele akwenze nsuku zonke.
To be fair.	Ukuze kube efanele.
There has to be something else.	Kufanele kube khona okunye.
Thank you for this, thank you very much.	Ngiyabonga ngalokhu, ngiyabonga kakhulu.
And in fact, it should not happen.	Futhi empeleni, akufanele kwenzeke.
And three months.	Futhi izinyanga ezintathu.
You need to do this now.	Udinga ukwenza lokhu manje.
Maybe he'll come back again.	Mhlawumbe uzobuya futhi.
No one wants to stay long.	Akekho ofuna ukuhlala isikhathi eside.
He is not very optimistic.	Akanalo ithemba kakhulu.
I want to get my place right.	Ngifuna ukuthola kahle indawo yami.
But it can only be a test.	Kodwa kungaba ukuhlolwa kuphela.
Tom opened it quickly.	UTom wavula ngokushesha.
I'm not sure about that.	Angiqiniseki ngakho.
He did something else.	Wenza okunye futhi.
Certainly not a word.	Impela akulona izwi.
I wish there was nothing wrong.	Sengathi akukho okubi.
I should have come earlier.	Bekufanele ngize ngaphambili.
We have had this.	Sibe nalokhu.
The idea came first.	Umqondo weza kuqala.
Finally there.	Ekugcineni lapho.
Food is best.	Ukudla kungcono kakhulu.
You really have to be good.	Kufanele ngempela ube muhle.
Whether it can be good, or good.	Ukuthi kungaba kuhle, noma kulungile.
For the rest of his life dad.	Ukuphila kwakhe konke ubaba .
If you always want to know.	Uma uhlala ufuna ukwazi.
Or all of these.	Noma zonke lezi.
I think kids.	Ngicabanga izingane.
I thought it would be later tonight.	Bengicabanga ukuthi kuzoba kamuva namhlanje ebusuku.
I'm really sorry now.	Ngiyaxolisa ngempela manje.
At least, recently.	Okungenani, muva nje.
He decided when to leave and when to stay.	Wanquma ukuthi ahambe nini futhi ahlale nini.
He still hasn't.	Akazange namanje.
But he did it last year.	Kodwa ukwenze ngonyaka odlule.

I want you to be beautiful to me.	Ngifuna ube muhle kimi.
But still one has to know.	Kodwa noma kunjalo umuntu kufanele azi.
Mary is capable of doing things.	UMariya uyakwazi ukwenza izinto.
I may have to attend a meeting.	Kungase kudingeke ngiye emhlanganweni.
He couldn't do nothing, he knew.	Wayengeke enze lutho, wayazi.
I only heard it in the morning.	Ngizwe ekuseni kuphela.
I desperately wanted to talk to her.	Ngangifuna kabi ukukhuluma naye.
I don't even want him to come back.	Angifuni nokuthi abuye.
This is nothing new and it always happens.	Lokhu akuyona into entsha futhi kwenzeka ngaso sonke isikhathi.
I will never do this again.	Ngeke ngiphinde ngikwenze lokhu.
Let's find a place.	Ake sithole indawo.
The whole truth is not a lie.	Lonke iqiniso akuwona amanga.
He knows he doesn't know everything.	Uyazi ukuthi akazi konke.
Instead, it seems.	Kunalokho, kubonakala.
He heard about it.	Wezwa ngakho.
It would be better this way, actually.	Kungaba ngcono ngale ndlela, empeleni.
I just want you to go with me.	Ngifuna nje ukuthi uhambe nami.
He started to come slowly.	Waqala ukuza kancane.
Don't forget to buy.	Ungakhohlwa ukuthenga.
I wanted to go every day.	Ngangifuna ukuhamba nsuku zonke.
I didn't think I should always do it.	Ngangingacabangi ukuthi kufanele ngikwenze njalo.

Because this is it.	Ngoba nguye lo.
I think that's really good.	Ngicabanga ukuthi lokho kuhle ngempela.
I couldn't help but think of that.	Angikwazanga ukuzibamba ngicabanga lokho.
I'm just not sure he didn't.	Angiqiniseki nje ukuthi akazange.

But it may or may not.	Kodwa kungenzeka noma cha.
He was afraid of nothing.	Wayesaba lutho.
But he seemed to want something.	Kodwa wayebonakala efuna okuthile.
You should stay with us.	Kufanele uhlale nathi.
My family, my friends.	Umndeni wami, abangani bami.

But he got out.	Kodwa waphuma.
He wanted to ride and he did well.	Wayefuna ukugibela futhi wenza kahle.
Not bad for power.	Hhayi kabi amandla.
So obviously it is dangerous.	Ngakho kusobala ukuthi ingozi.

This seems to be very helpful to me.	Lokhu kubonakala sengathi kungase kube usizo kakhulu kimi.
I want to be there for a long time.	Ngifuna ukuba khona isikhathi eside.
My mother did it.	Umama wakwenza.
I don’t really know everything.	Angazi konke ngempela.
Definitely not to do.	Nakanjani akukho okumele akwenze.
Probably everyone knows.	Mhlawumbe wonke umuntu uyazi.
But you do not need to do that here.	Kodwa awudingi ukwenza lokho lapha.
And it is not the only thing wrong.	Futhi akuyona into kuphela engalungile.
It will only get better.	Kuzoba ngcono kuphela.
And a new job means it too.	Futhi umsebenzi omusha usho futhi.
I knew that.	Ngangazi kanjalo.
He could not stop something.	Akakwazanga ukuyeka enye into.
I hear the question all the time.	Ngizwa umbuzo ngaso sonke isikhathi.
No we are not.	Cha asikho.
Very common.	Uvame kakhulu.
Any answer at all.	Noma iyiphi impendulo nhlobo.

Let's find out what's there.	Ake sithole ukuthi yini lapho.
I found a picture.	Ngithole isithombe.
We need to hear.	Sidinga ukuzwa.
If you want to make one.	Uma ufuna ukwenza eyodwa.
Also, you are the best person in the world!	Futhi, ungumuntu ongcono kakhulu emhlabeni!
Getting on the bus should be very difficult.	Ukugibela ibhasi kumele kube nzima kakhulu.
Not that it won't happen.	Hhayi ukuthi ngeke kwenzeke.
There is no time for an answer.	Asikho isikhathi lapho impendulo.
None of this should happen.	Akukho kulokhu okufanele kwenzeke.
I've thought that myself.	Ngike ngacabanga lokho mina.
This is nothing new, either.	Lokhu akuyona into entsha, futhi.
Everyone wanted to play with him.	Wonke umuntu wayefuna ukudlala naye.
I really had to go with it.	Kwadingeka ngihambe ngayo ngempela.
It's time for us to leave.	Sekuyisikhathi sokuthi sihambe.
Only a few years.	Iminyaka embalwa kuphela.
I should have said nothing.	Kwakungafanele ngisho lutho.
You never had him.	Awukaze ube naye.
This is not for him.	Lokhu akukho kuye.
It would be great to do that.	Kungaba kuhle kakhulu ukwenza lokho.
No this will not happen.	Cha ngeke kwenzeke lokhu.
And so, he tried again.	Futhi ngakho, wazama futhi.

If he wants to work.	Uma efuna ukusebenza.
Yes, only three years.	Yebo, iminyaka emithathu kuphela.
But he is not one of us.	Kodwa akayena omunye wethu.
I want you to know.	Ngifuna wazi .
His music has never really been better !.	Umculo wakhe awukaze ube ngcono ngempela!.
He became a child.	Waba ingane.
My father does not know that.	Ubaba akakwazi lokho.
Everyone seemed happy at the time.	Wonke umuntu wayebonakala ejabule ngaleso sikhathi.
As little as possible.	Kancane ngangokunokwenzeka.
He goes his own way.	Uhamba ngendlela yakhe.
It takes money to do that.	Kudingeka ukwenza imali ukwenza kanjalo.
I just can’t make up my mind.	Angikwazi nje ukwenza umqondo wami.
I wanted another baby.	Ngangifuna enye ingane.
A few years now.	Iminyaka embalwa manje.
He kept looking at the door.	Wahlala wabuka umnyango.
He wanted to do more.	Wayefuna ukwenza okuningi.
There is cooking.	Kukhona ukupheka.
Play to read.	Ukudlala ukufunda.
I really don't have time for you.	Anginaso ngempela isikhathi sakho.
These can be difficult to do properly.	Lezi kungaba nzima ukuzenza kahle.
He couldn't do it, but he tried anyway.	Akakwazanga ukukwenza, kodwa wazama noma kunjalo.
Yes, there is.	Yebo, kukho.
This time he made a lot of noise.	Kulokhu wenze umsindo omkhulu.
I found the way before.	Ngithole indlela ngaphambili.
I can't go out very late at night.	Angikwazi ukuphuma ebusuku kakhulu.
I suspect it won’t be hard to find.	Ngisola ukuthi ngeke kube nzima ukuthola.
A little bit more recently.	Kancane kancane kamuva nje.
Maybe it's my fault.	Mhlawumbe iphutha lami.
Nothing about me.	Akukho lutho ngami.
I know it will take time to get there.	Ngiyazi ukuthi kuzothatha isikhathi ukufika lapho.
In fact, my father wanted me to become a doctor.	Empeleni ubaba wayefuna ngibe udokotela.
For that, thank you.	Ngalokho, ngiyabonga.

A small dog, but a dog anyway.	Inja encane, kodwa inja noma kunjalo.
His food is very good.	Ukudla kwakhe kuhle kakhulu.

That should have been the reason.	Lokho kwakufanele kube isizathu.
This was clear.	Lokhu kwacaca.
He went his own way.	Wahamba ngendlela yakhe.

I really wanted to get this one.	Ngangifuna ngempela ukuthola lena.

At least, all of that seems fine.	Okungenani, konke lokho kubonakala kulungile.
It had to be a book.	Kwakufanele kube incwadi.
Things all the way.	Izinto yonke indlela.
Her dad seems to know everyone here.	Ubaba wakhe sengathi wazi wonke umuntu lapha.
And he said yes.	Futhi uthe yebo.
And it looks bad.	Futhi kubukeka kabi.
Yes, a new person once.	Yebo, umuntu omusha kanye.
There seems to be no work.	Kubonakala sengathi akukho msebenzi.

True, probably.	Iqiniso, mhlawumbe.
Don't be tall.	Ungabi mude.
There may be some truth in this.	Kungase kube khona iqiniso kulokhu.
Let me do one more thing.	Ake ngenze into eyodwa futhi.
I'm sure it should be hard for him.	Nginesiqiniseko sokuthi kumele kube nzima kuye.
Another car, too.	Enye imoto, futhi.
There is absolutely no good reason.	Asikho neze isizathu esihle.
She did this while she was happy.	Wakwenza lokho ngesikhathi ejabule.
Or maybe also coffee.	Noma mhlawumbe futhi ikhofi.

And it's been a big deal here.	Futhi kube yinto enkulu lapha.
My turn, now.	Ithuba lami, manje.
But he did not have a gun.	Kodwa wayengenaso isibhamu.
The question is whether that will happen to him.	Umbuzo uthi kuzokwenzeka yini kuye lokho.
The boy is invisible.	Umfana akabonakali.
That's great.	Leyo enkulu.
It just won't be me.	Ngeke nje kube yimina.
I said anything.	Ngathi noma yini.
I mean, you shouldn’t have done it.	Ngisho, bekungafanele ukwenze.
Or he did not, instead.	Noma akazange, kunalokho.

It may be for a while.	Kungase kube isikhashana.
And so it always is.	Futhi kunjalo njalo.

At first, her mother did not want her to leave.	Ekuqaleni, umama wakhe wayengafuni ahambe.
You do not need to see anything.	Awudingi ukubona lutho.
So you need help.	Ngakho udinga usizo.
This is a choice, and it is not a necessity.	Lokhu ukukhetha, futhi akusona isidingo.
Here we have it in the end.	Lapha sibe nakho ekugcineni.
You will need to spend time on this.	Uzodinga ukuchitha isikhathi kulokhu.

No, nothing more.	Cha, akukho okunye.
I will not go.	Ngeke ngihambe .
I will be busy for a long time.	Ngizoba matasa isikhathi eside.

Really nice baby.	Ingane enhle ngempela.
I like this much better.	Ngithanda lokhu kangcono kakhulu.
He pleaded guilty.	Wavuma icala.

That is very good for him.	Lokho kuhle kakhulu kuye.
Now he does it all the time.	Manje wenza ngaso sonke isikhathi.
Dad wants me to make a story.	Ubaba ufuna ngenze indaba.

But there is more.	Kodwa kukhona enye into.
But he did not want to suffer.	Kodwa wayengafuni ukuzwa ubuhlungu.
It's not my book.	Akuyona incwadi yami.
Not my children.	Hhayi izingane zami.
I know you should not go there.	Ngiyazi akufanele uye lapho.
But he did many other things.	Kodwa wenza izinto eziningi.
Slowly up.	Kancane kancane phezulu.
He said that it should not be so.	Wathi akufanele kube njalo.
He could not have known that this had happened to him.	Wayengeke akwazi ukuthi lokho kwenzeke kuye.
Everything is not just him.	Konke akuyena nje.
You do not really need to know anything about it.	Akudingekile ngempela ukwazi lutho ngalokho.
I did three.	Ngenze ezintathu.
But this should never happen.	Kodwa lokhu akufanele neze kwenzeke.
If you can't afford a car, you can't stay there.	Uma ungakwazi ukuthenga imoto, awukwazi ukuhlala lapho.
I was thinking about him.	Bengicabanga ngaye.
No, he says.	Akunjalo, usho kanje.
Is this.	Ngabe lokhu .
Right up there.	Khona phezulu lapho.
Learning to do is always good.	Ukufunda ngokwenza kuhle njalo.

All right, let me do it again.	Kulungile, ake ngikwenze futhi.
That's good, that's fine.	Kuhle lokho, kuhle lokho.
Maybe this seems obvious.	Mhlawumbe lokhu kubonakala kusobala.
And why to him alone? 	Futhi kungani kuye yedwa?
The mother of it all.	Umama wakho konke.
But these.	Kodwa lezi.
All and nothing.	Konke futhi lutho.
There is nothing you need to do, really.	Akukho okumele ukwenze, ngempela.
But my son is possible.	Kodwa indodana yami kungenzeka.
He doesn't want me to talk.	Akafuni ngikhulume.
We need to stay with that.	Sidinga ukuhlala nalokho.
A lot, a lot.	Kuningi, kuningi.
He wants nothing to do with you.	Akafuni lutho ngawe.
You will not tell anyone.	Ngeke utshele omunye umuntu.
Everything happened as it should.	Konke kwenzeke njengoba kufanele.
Work heard it all.	Umsebenzi wezwa konke.
That's it, really.	Yilokho, ngempela.
Very soon, perhaps.	Ngokushesha kakhulu, mhlawumbe.
You look better.	Ubukeka kangcono.
I think it should have happened this way.	Ngicabanga ukuthi bekufanele kwenzeke ngale ndlela.
It is not a new concept.	Akukhona ukuthi umqondo omusha.
Absolutely false though.	Amanga ngokuphelele kunjalo.
And such a thing.	Futhi into enjalo.
I do not know at all and neither do you.	Angazi nhlobo futhi nawe angazi.
That dog.	Inja leyo.
You just don’t know what it is.	Awukwazi nje ukuthi yini.
Until then.	Kuze kube njalo.
He said he wanted to help.	Wathi ufuna ukusiza.
Why there? 	Kungani lapho?
My father wanted a boy.	Ubaba wayefuna umfana.
I always think of you and feel the same way.	Ngihlale ngicabanga ngawe futhi ngizizwa ngendlela efanayo.
I look bad.	Ngibukeka kabi.
Either way is possible.	Noma iyiphi enye indlela kungenzeka.
And everyone is happy.	Futhi wonke umuntu ujabule.
It is not a room at all.	Akulona igumbi nhlobo.
So I thought.	Ngakho ngacabanga.
Very true, very true, very true.	Kuyiqiniso kakhulu, kuyiqiniso kakhulu, kuyiqiniso kakhulu.
That is better for both of us.	Lokho kungcono kithi sobabili.
Have you tried that.	Uke wazama lokho.
I don't like it, but it's okay.	Angithandi, kodwa kulungile.
And sometimes there is another sound, too.	Futhi ngezinye izikhathi kukhona omunye umsindo, futhi.
But very little.	Kodwa kancane kakhulu.
He heard many things.	Wezwa izinto eziningi.
You are wrong about everything.	Unephutha ngakho konke.
I thought about him a lot at night.	Ngangicabanga ngaye kakhulu ebusuku.
Lunch is good.	Ukudla kwasemini kuhle.
Either way.	Noma iyiphi indlela.
Slowly, very slowly.	Kancane, kancane kakhulu.
Only the father.	Ubaba yedwa.
He said so.	Wakhuluma kanjalo .
That has to happen again.	Lokho kufanele kwenzeke futhi.
He refused, and went away.	Wenqaba, wahamba.
Small space.	Indawo encane.
Not his food.	Hhayi ukudla kwakhe.
I don't even know his son.	Angazi nokuthi indodana yakhe.
He should have done that.	Bekufanele akwenze lokho.
We want to work with you.	Sifuna ukusebenza nawe.
But there is nothing to be done about it.	Kodwa akukho okumele kwenziwe ngalokho.
That often happens.	Kaningi lokho kwenzeka.
Sometimes, death is better.	Ngezinye izikhathi, ukufa kungcono.
Always, every day, everywhere.	Njalo, nsuku zonke, yonke indawo.
Not that much.	Hhayi lokho okuningi.
It does not mean that it is not true.	Akusho lutho ukuthi akulona iqiniso.
I'm leaving tonight.	Ngizohamba namhlanje ebusuku.
He should not have left.	Bekungafanele ahambe.
It's such a bad thing.	Yinto embi kangaka.
If this happens again, you will know what to do.	Uma lokhu kwenzeka futhi, uzokwazi ukuthi wenzeni.
He was amazed at how it happened.	Wamangala ukuthi kwenzeke kanjani.
But sometimes, you have to do what you have to do.	Kodwa ngezinye izikhathi, kufanele wenze lokho okufanele ukwenze.
You didn't.	Awuzange ube.
he said.	wathi.
Hopefully someone will know.	Ngethemba omunye uzokwazi.

And she's beautiful, obviously.	Futhi muhle, ngokusobala.
We have done our best.	Sikwenze konke okusemandleni.
I hope everyone is happy.	Ngethemba ukuthi wonke umuntu ujabule.
My father left years ago.	Ubaba wahamba eminyakeni edlule.
Great man too.	Umuntu omkhulu futhi.
He seems to be a great man though.	Ubonakala uyindoda enkulu kodwa.
Thinking nothing.	Ukucabanga lutho.
He is too good to be true.	Muhle kakhulu ukuba angakwenzi.
You did not have time.	Awuzange ube nesikhathi.
Everything should be so.	Konke kufanele kube njalo.
Not all life.	Akuyona yonke impilo.
I know you need a job.	Ngiyazi udinga umsebenzi.
He thought that was true.	Wayecabanga ukuthi lokho kuyiqiniso.
Something is really wrong.	Kukhona into engalungile ngempela.
At least, most of the time.	Okungenani, isikhathi esiningi.
I think almost everyone here.	Ngicabanga ukuthi cishe wonke umuntu lapha.
It is very good for him to do that.	Kuhle kakhulu kuye ukwenza lokho.
This is said to be good.	Lokhu kuthiwa kuhle.
Obviously, he knew everything.	Ngokusobala, wayazi yonke into.
But this is not the case at all.	Kodwa lokhu akunjalo nhlobo.
And there is more about him.	Futhi kukhona okunye ngaye.
I feel empowered.	Ngizwa amandla.
Unless you just do that.	Ngaphandle kokuthi wenza lokho nje.
That's right, at night.	Kunjalo nje, ebusuku.
But I will never do it again.	Kodwa ngeke ngiphinde.
Probably invisible.	Mhlawumbe akabonakali.
You just have to do it.	Kufanele nje ukwenze.
Our problem.	Inkinga yethu.
If you don't know the time, that's fine.	Uma ungakwazi isikhathi lokho, kuhle.
Great mom.	Umama omkhulu.
I don't see anyone else.	Angiboni omunye umuntu.
Someone just said no.	Omunye wavele wathi cha.
He did a few things.	Wenza izinto ezimbalwa.
Until you know, anything is possible.	Kuze kube uyazi, konke kungenzeka.
But you play with me just because.	Kodwa udlala nami nje ngoba.
She seemed happy, even happy.	Wayebonakala ejabule, ejabule ngisho.
It has to be me.	Kumele kube yimi.
He is a happy young man too.	Uyinsizwa ejabule futhi.
But now, of course, he is there.	Kodwa manje, kusobala, ukhona.

I just want a job.	Ngifuna umsebenzi nje.
I'm not sure exactly when.	Angiqiniseki kahle ukuthi nini.
You know how this happened.	Uyazi ukuthi kwenzeke kanjani lokhu.
Let me do this and do it.	Ake ngenze lokhu futhi ngikwenze.

No, but.	Cha, kodwa.
Another died instantly.	Omunye washona khona lapho.
But how can I do this.	Kodwa ngingakwenza kanjani lokhu.
He never got better.	Akazange abe ngcono.
He could not drive home.	Akakwazanga ukushayela ekhaya.
But we need to move fast.	Kodwa sidinga ukuhamba ngokushesha.
But we probably won't have to find out.	Kodwa mhlawumbe ngeke kudingeke ukuthi sithole.
He just works right there.	Usebenza khona nje.
You had to do that.	Kwakufanele ukwenze lokho.
He speaks all the time.	Ukhuluma sonke isikhathi.
Or go home.	Noma uhambe uye ekhaya.
I like a nice hat.	Ngithanda isigqoko esihle.
But one thing at a time.	Kodwa into eyodwa ngesikhathi.
Please, sit down.	Ngicela, uhlale phansi.
Not to me.	Hhayi kimi .
You know, if it happens.	Uyazi, uma kwenzeka.

If you do not, there are.	Uma ungakwenzi, kukhona.
My family is really happy, too.	Umndeni wami ujabule ngempela, futhi.
Also, fixing can be really difficult.	Futhi, ukulungisa kungaba nzima ngempela.
Not just perfectly fine beer.	Hhayi nje ubhiya omuhle ngokuphelele.
He should not be alone here with her.	Akumele abe yedwa lapha naye.
He just didn't see that.	Akazange nje abone lokho.
And for me, all the time.	Futhi ngami, sonke isikhathi.
Some need not know.	Okunye akudingeki ukwazi.
That could be years.	Lokho kungaba iminyaka.
Really, really, really really.	Ngempela, ngempela, ngempela ngempela.
Nothing had to happen.	Akukho kwakufanele kwenzeke.

No need, no need at all.	Asikho isidingo, asikho nhlobo isidingo.
Very good, he says.	Kuhle kakhulu, uthi.

Well done with him.	Kahle kahle naye.
I want to live again.	Ngifuna ukuphila futhi.
One small problem.	Inkinga eyodwa encane.

So think about that.	Ngakho ake ucabange ngalokho.
He always came.	Wafika njalo.
No, I'm surprised.	Cha, ngiyamangala.
But you think better about it.	Kodwa ucabanga kangcono ngakho.
Or he does not want to be.	Noma engafuni ukuba.
Not my father.	Hhayi ubaba wami.
Not a child.	Akuyona ingane.
I can no longer wait to play.	Angisakwazi ukulinda ukudlala.
Almost everyone plays soccer.	Cishe wonke umuntu udlala ibhola.

Obviously this has to be there.	Ngokusobala lokhu kufanele kube khona.
And you can't think of anything bad.	Futhi awukwazi ukucabanga into embi.
Reading a book.	Ukufunda incwadi.
No, please.	Cha, ngicela .
We did something in between.	Senza okuthile phakathi.
I've never been here.	Angikaze ngifike lapha.
Sometimes this is not the case.	Ngezinye izikhathi lokhu akunjalo.
I didn’t think much about it at the time.	Angizange ngicabange kakhulu ngakho ngaleso sikhathi.
I can't believe it.	Angikholwa .

Repairing repairs.	Ukulungisa ukulungisa.
Don't be too hard at first.	Ungabi nzima kakhulu ekuqaleni.
I wonder about this myself.	Ngiyazibuza ngalokhu mina.
And that was all that was needed.	Futhi yilokho kuphela okwakudingeka.
I couldn’t do it in the end.	Angikwazanga ukukwenza ekugcineni.
Coming home can be difficult.	Ukuza ekhaya kungaba nzima.
Or, so he thought.	Noma, ngakho wacabanga.
Okay, so maybe not.	Kulungile, ngakho mhlawumbe akunjalo.
Not one time, at least.	Hhayi ngesikhathi esisodwa, okungenani.
He thought such a thing could happen.	Wayecabanga ukuthi kuzokwenzeka into enjalo.

There is a better way.	Kukhona enye indlela engcono.
He didn't know how he did it.	Wayengazi ukuthi wakwenza kanjani.
Now we need your help to make it happen.	Manje sidinga usizo lwakho ukuze senze kwenzeke.
My mother took my place.	Umama wangena esikhundleni sami.
Apparently, he wanted to get out.	Ngokusobala, wayefuna ukuphuma.
Music only.	Umculo kuphela.
Very early departure.	Ukuhamba ekuseni kakhulu.
All in all, he was not very high.	Konke, wayengekho phezulu kakhulu.
He tried to take up as little space as possible.	Wazama ukuthatha indawo encane ngangokunokwenzeka.
Not yet, apparently, but soon.	Hhayi okwamanje, ngokusobala, kodwa maduze.
I certainly would have known.	Impela ngabe ngazi.
His home is everywhere and there is no place.	Umuzi wakhe ukhona yonke indawo futhi akukho ndawo.
Really kids.	Izingane ngempela .
I have never been easier since.	Angikaze ngibe lula kusukela ngaleso sikhathi.
He did not say anything or anything.	Akazange asho lutho noma lutho.

I need to sleep though.	Ngidinga ukulala kodwa.
Hope to find a car.	Ngethemba ukuthola imoto.
This is his life.	Lena impilo yakhe.
The test should be done as soon as possible.	Ukuhlolwa kufanele kwenziwe ngokushesha ngangokunokwenzeka.
That is not our view.	Akuwona umbono wethu lowo.
Well, yes.	Kuhle, yebo.
That could just be me.	Lokho kungaba yimina nje.
And not just for years.	Futhi hhayi nje iminyaka.
That would be very easy for me.	Lokho kungaba lula kakhulu kimi.

So we can't stay there.	Ngakho asikwazi ukuhlala lapho.
John told me.	UJohn wangitshela.
I wish I could go more.	Ngifisa ukuhamba kakhulu.
And it can be, very easily.	Futhi kungaba, kalula kakhulu.
It should be, but it is not.	Kufanele kube, kodwa akunjalo.
Not so with this book.	Akunjalo ngale ncwadi.
He wants a picture of her.	Ufuna isithombe sakhe.
Me, and I alone.	Mina, nami ngedwa.
This is best for dad and not mom.	Lokhu kungcono kakhulu ubaba hhayi umama.
Too much sleep, to be honest.	Ukulala okuningi, ukukhuluma iqiniso.
But he felt better, almost immediately.	Kodwa wazizwa engcono, cishe ngokushesha.
And he is not a bad person at all.	Futhi akayena umuntu omubi ngempela.
Maybe it's just me.	Mhlawumbe yimina kuphela.
Nobody passed up here.	Akekho umuntu odlule lapha phezulu.
And just like that, too.	Futhi kanjalo nje, futhi.
This is the way and why.	Lena indlela futhi kungani.
I live alone, most of the time.	Ngihlala ngedwa, isikhathi esiningi.
There is truth in all of this.	Kukhona iqiniso kukho konke lokhu.
Does anyone know what it could be ??.	Ukhona owaziyo ukuthi kungaba yini??.

But the food is actually very good.	Kodwa ukudla empeleni kuhle kakhulu.
Now everyone asked.	Manje wonke umuntu wabuza.
Coffee for me.	Ikhofi kimi.
This is not a problem nearby.	Lena akuyona inkinga eduze.

You did very well in it.	Wenze kahle kakhulu kukho.
But you know very well.	Kodwa wazi ngokuphelele kakhulu.

So far it has been very good.	Kuze kube manje kube kuhle kakhulu.
I want to know if it is possible.	Ngifuna ukwazi ukuthi kungenzeka yini.

I have to find out more.	Kufanele ngithole okwengeziwe.
I can't say which one.	Angikwazi ukusho ukuthi iyiphi.
You are busy, but you are happy.	Umatasa, kodwa ujabule.
It may be a moment.	Kungaba isikhashana.
I never want to stop seeing you.	Angifuni neze ukuyeka ukukubona.
I wonder if that is not true.	Kazi akulona yini iqiniso.
Not really me.	Empeleni akumina.
At least he asked.	Okungenani wabuza.
We found the way in the evening.	Sithole indlela kusihlwa.
Yes, he had to learn to eat.	Yebo, kwadingeka afunde ukudla.
He asked me to leave first.	Wangicela ukuthi ngihambe kuqala.
If you can, you need to take a chance.	Uma ukwazi, udinga ukuthatha ithuba.
And one for me too.	Futhi eyodwa kimi futhi.
But that is not the case.	Kodwa lokho akukho.
Very little but definitely.	Kancane kakhulu kodwa nakanjani.
Mom says your dad looks happy.	Umama uthi ubaba wakho ubonakala ejabule.
The only question is time.	Umbuzo kuphela isikhathi.
So he did.	Ngakho wenza.
I need health.	Ngidinga impilo.
She did not think she was beautiful.	Wayengacabangi ukuthi muhle.
It seems possible.	Kubonakala sengathi kungenzeka ngempela.
Let me go now.	Ake ngihambe manje.
And someone else.	Futhi omunye umuntu.
You can do it your way too.	Ungakwenza ngendlela yakho futhi.
But that is not a big problem.	Kodwa akuyona inkinga enkulu leyo.

There is no reason you should know.	Asikho isizathu okufanele ngabe wazi.
He said to her.	Wathi kuye.
He did not know how long he would have to live.	Wayengazi ukuthi uzohlala isikhathi esingakanani.
I will never go home again, he said to himself.	Ngeke ngiphinde ngihambe ekhaya, wakhuluma yedwa.
He is coming tonight.	Uyeza namhlanje ebusuku.
You know what happened to me, by the way.	Uyazi ukuthi kwenzekani kimi, ngendlela.
Not too much to do in the area.	Hhayi kakhulu ukwenza endaweni.

We need to get better around him.	Kudingeka sibe ngcono eduze kwakhe.
You need everything.	Udinga konke.
Would you like to continue ?.	Ungathanda ukuqhubeka?.
I would be better off without her.	Ngizoba ngcono ngaphandle kwakhe.
And, yes, beautiful.	Futhi, yebo, enhle.
I had to think for a moment.	Kwadingeka ngicabange isikhashana.
Because he wasn't sure he wouldn't.	Ngoba wayengenaso isiqiniseko sokuthi wayengeke.
He would love to do it.	Angathanda ukukwenza.
And not at all.	Futhi neze.
Even her father is not there.	Noma ubaba wakhe akekho.
It may, of course.	Kungase, yebo.
I always am.	Yimi njalo.
I wish you had done that.	Sengathi uke wakwenza lokho.
The music is beautiful, really beautiful.	Umculo muhle, muhle ngempela.
And if you feel better, you will do better.	Futhi uma uzizwa ungcono, uzokwenza kangcono.
Before you leave.	Ngaphambi kokuthi uhambe.
I would not have thought of that.	Bengingeke ngicabange ngalokho.
The following week, he decided.	Ngesonto elizayo, wanquma.
Almost anything.	Cishe noma yini.
It’s so much better, actually.	Kungcono kakhulu, empeleni.
Please tell me you are wrong.	Ngicela ungitshele ukuthi unephutha.
Anyone tell me what the problem is.	Noma ubani angitshele ukuthi yini inkinga.
The picture was clear.	Kwacaca isithombe.
Yes he can.	Yebo angakwazi.
No one knows who this person is yet.	Akekho owaziyo ukuthi ubani lo muntu okwamanje.
He should not have tried.	Bekungafanele azame.
It could be, very good.	Kungaba njalo, kuhle kakhulu.
Well tried.	Ukuzama kahle.
Of course you do not want to go there.	Yebo awufuni ukuya lapho.
Power is needed.	Kudingeka amandla.
This needs to be done only once.	Lokhu kudingeka kwenziwe kanye kuphela.
Nice place, nowhere.	Indawo enhle, engekho ndawo.
I don't know how you got there.	Angazi ukuthi ufike kanjani lapho.
That was all that was needed.	Yilokho kuphela okwakudingeka.
But he could not come.	Kodwa akakwazanga ukuza.
I want to tell you about it.	Ngifuna ukukutshela ngakho.
I will never know, and that is okay for me.	Angisoze ngazi, futhi lokho kulungile kimi.
But he did not want to go to college.	Kodwa wayengafuni ukuya ekolishi.
He agreed to another.	Wavuma omunye.
We need to move on.	Sidinga ukuqhubeka.
But only crying.	Kodwa ukukhala kuphela.
But now he is making a big mistake.	Kodwa manje wenza iphutha elikhulu.
He did not know what to do now.	Wayengazi ukuthi yini okumele ayenze manje.
In front of him, up, behind him.	Ngaphambi kwakhe, phezulu, ngemuva kwakhe.
Out here no one thinks much of it.	Lapha ngaphandle akekho ocabanga kakhulu ngakho.
But today he could not control himself.	Kodwa namuhla akakwazanga ukuzibamba.
I don't even know what else.	Angazi nokuthi yini enye.
He said he felt bad.	Uthe uzizwa kabi.
Or he thought about his homework.	Noma wacabanga ngomsebenzi wakhe wesikole.
You can't buy anything.	Awukwazi ukuthenga lutho.
We arrive alone and go the same way.	Sifika sodwa sihambe ngendlela efanayo.
That is not a problem for me.	Lokho akuyona inkinga kimi.
I have to get to the station.	Kumele ngifike esiteshini.
Everything, a car.	Konke, imoto.
The boy wondered why this was so bad.	Wazibuza umfana ukuthi yini lena embi kangaka.
Or all my problems.	Noma zonke izinkinga zami.
It's hard to talk sometimes, it's hard to eat.	Kunzima ukukhuluma ngezinye izikhathi, kunzima ukudla.
And that is what life is all about.	Futhi yilokho okwenziwa ukuphila.
He did not stay with me for dinner.	Akazange ahlale nami isidlo sakusihlwa.
He knew better, of course.	Wayazi kangcono, kunjalo.
You don't have to say that.	Awudingi ukusho lokho.
All of this is good.	Kuhle konke lokhu.
It has to be that way.	Kufanele kube njalo njalo.
We need your help to make it happen.	Sidinga usizo lwakho ukuze kwenzeke.
Nothing to say about that, of course.	Akukho okushiwo kulokho, kunjalo.
Lots of lies.	Amanga amaningi.
I would not have done this without you.	Bengingeke ngikwenze lokhu ngaphandle kwakho.
Well, that's not entirely true.	Kulungile, lokho akulona iqiniso ngokuphelele.
I know we didn't.	Ngiyazi ukuthi asizange.
This too is absolutely true.	Lokhu nakho kuyiqiniso ngokuphelele.
That is exactly what happened.	Yilokho ngempela okwenzeka.
False too.	Amanga futhi.
He wants nothing from me this afternoon.	Akafuni lutho kimi ntambama.
I know he feels the same way about me.	Ngiyazi ukuthi naye uzizwa ngendlela efanayo ngami.
Good.	Kuhle .
I just love riding.	Ngithanda nje ukugibela.
You only know what you need to know.	Wazi kuphela lokho okufanele ukwazi.
Just a little bit at the beginning.	Kancane nje ekuqaleni.
Once at work and once at home.	Kanye emsebenzini futhi kanye ekhaya.
As he is, he will not go.	Njengoba enjalo, ngeke ahambe.
You do not know why this is happening.	Awazi ukuthi kungani lokhu kwenzeka.
You probably know nothing about me.	Cishe wazi lutho ngami.
He tried to find his strength.	Wazama ukuthola amandla akhe.
I have never done such a thing.	Angikaze ngenze into enjalo.
Yes, on the weekend.	Yebo, ngempelasonto.
I'm trying to help the team here.	Ngizama ukusiza iqembu lapha.
And not just anywhere.	Futhi hhayi nje noma iyiphi indawo.
I want to tell my truth.	Ngifuna ukukhuluma iqiniso lami.
I want to know how he did it, and why.	Ngifuna ukwazi ukuthi wakwenza kanjani, futhi kungani.
The boy can do it well.	Umfana angakwenza kahle.
No matter how hard you try to do it.	Noma ngabe uzama ukukwenza kanjani.
He said how he knew.	Wathi wakwazi kanjani.
I mean, that's obvious.	Ngisho, lokho kusobala.
But the idea is wrong.	Kodwa umqondo unephutha.
Unfortunately, these sites offer limited statistics.
