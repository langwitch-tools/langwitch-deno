Yes, everyone knows.	ya kabeh wong ngerti
Now there is another option with him.	saiki ana pilihan liyane karo dheweke
I know that we can have fun together.	aku ngerti yen kita bisa seneng bebarengan
This thing is not new.	bab iki dudu anyar
I came straight to the point.	aku teka langsung menyang titik
It’s not that we want to get everything right.	iku ora kita pengin njaluk kabeh bener
Then he will know what to do.	banjur dheweke bakal ngerti apa sing kudu ditindakake
One more, he said to himself.	siji maneh dheweke ngomong dhewe
I don’t know how anyone can do that.	aku ora ngerti carane wong bisa nindakake iku
Maybe it will, and this time is completely different.	mungkin bakal lan wektu iki pancen beda
But this is not the most common case.	nanging iki dudu kasus paling umum
There was no one in the house except us.	ora ana wong ing omah kajaba kita
It’s hard to make out.	iku angel kanggo nggawe metu
If possible, no one would say anything.	yen bisa ora ana sing ngomong apaapa
I’m just not alone.	aku mung ora dhewe
If you don’t ask you won’t learn.	yen sampeyan ora takon sampeyan ora bakal sinau
Someone laughed.	ana wong ngguyu
More about that to come !.	liyane babagan sing bakal teka
She was happy, actually.	dheweke seneng bener
And not before.	lan ora sadurunge
So that should be enough at this point.	dadi kudu cukup ing wektu iki
He couldn't help it.	dheweke ora bisa mbantu
But you can just ask, and you don’t have to ask for this.	nanging sampeyan mung bisa takon lan ora kudu njaluk iki
Because they found themselves laughing at each other.	amarga padha ketemu ngguyu ing saben liyane
I didn’t think much of that at first.	aku ora mikir akeh sing pisanan
In the open.	ing mbukak
He is with you everywhere.	dheweke karo sampeyan ing ngendi wae
It will take most of these other days.	iku bakal njupuk paling dina liyane iki
And if not, it’s not her problem.	lan yen ora iku ora masalah dheweke
I wanted to get up there.	aku kepengin munggah ing kono
And it’s still not done.	lan isih durung rampung
Otherwise, you don’t know anything after that.	yen ora sampeyan ora ngerti apaapa sawise iku
For him, this was just another day.	kanggo dheweke iki mung dina liyane

He met her, then looked away.	dheweke ketemu karo dheweke banjur nyawang adoh
He seemed to know not to speak.	dheweke kaya ngerti ora ngomong
You can move to one, then to the other.	sampeyan bisa pindhah menyang siji banjur menyang liyane
This is the best, the best guys.	iki sing paling apik wong lanang sing paling apik

He doesn’t have enough.	dheweke ora duwe cukup
The board is now very fast.	papan saiki wis cepet banget
But will it stay ?.	nanging bakal tetep
And you know, they still have it.	lan sampeyan ngerti dheweke isih duwe
Of course, a new taste.	mesthi wae rasa anyar
It’s always coming back.	iku tansah bali
In this case, it's that problem.	ing kasus iki iku masalah sing
They would be afraid to say so.	wongwong mau bakal wedi ngomong ngono
He doesn’t look any better.	dheweke ora katon luwih apik
This is family life, the real thing, the point.	iki urip kulawarga bab nyata titik
Here and now it eats or dies.	kene lan saiki iku mangan utawa mati
Just take us.	mung njupuk kita
At least this method works.	paling ora cara iki bisa digunakake
They died before they could talk to him.	padha mati sadurunge padha bisa ngomong karo dheweke
But we found a way out.	nanging kita nemokake dalan metu
I'm going to try it.	aku arep nyoba
An hour or so of sleep is good.	jam utawa luwih turu iku apik
That’s not to say that people don’t.	sing ora ngomong yen wong ora nindakake
Think about her.	mikir bab dheweke
He knew it could be difficult for him.	dheweke ngerti yen bisa dadi angel kanggo wong

I have to stop thinking like that.	aku kudu mandheg mikir kaya ngono

A lot of people talk about the same thing.	akeh wong sing ngomong babagan sing padha
This is unlikely to happen.	iki ora mungkin kedadeyan
And he was very sick.	lan dheweke lara banget

You are in it.	sampeyan ing
This situation is not new.	kahanan iki ora anyar

There are differences there.	ana beda ing kono

And sometimes, it really is.	lan kadhangkala iku pancene
