There and then.	teo ary avy eo
It’s all about the money.	ny zavadrehetra dia momba ny vola
Someone else has to do it.	olona hafa no tsy maintsy manao izany
And of course happy when the news arrives.	ary mazava ho azy fa faly rehefa tonga ny vaovao
Fast and easy.	haingana sy mora
But many other places as well.	fa toerana maro hafa koa
He could do nothing.	tsy afaka nanao na inona na inona izy
It’s harder than it looks.	sarotra kokoa noho ny hita izany
There is something about the place.	misy zavatra momba ilay toerana
We do all the work.	manao ny asa rehetra izahay
What could be the problem ?.	inona no mety ho olana
It is near.	efa akaiky izany
She is happy.	faly izy
Look at things, though.	jereo ny zavatra na dia
But he is coming.	fa ho avy izy
People make their way for them.	manao lalana ho azy ireo ny olona
Very fun.	mahafinaritra be
I think that’s a good idea.	heveriko fa hevitra tsara izany
It is done.	atao izany
There are general reasons as well.	misy antony ankapobeny koa
The conversation can be very easy.	mety ho mora tokoa ny resaka
Here is one that could be better.	ity misy iray izay mety ho tsara kokoa
It will be.	izany dia ho
We can no longer do it.	tsy afaka manao intsony isika
They really have something bigger.	tena manana zavatra lehibe kokoa izy ireo
He himself told me.	izy mihitsy no nilaza tamiko
Then we move on to another.	avy eo isika dia mandeha aminny iray hafa
That’s far better.	tsara lavitra izany
It will be better for him.	ho tsara kokoa ho azy izany
But everything is better than good.	saingy tsara kokoa noho ny tsara ny zavadrehetra
We are happy to have it.	faly izahay manana izany
It became a very pleasant place.	lasa toerana tena nahafinaritra ilay izy
Everything is lost.	very ny zavadrehetra
Clearly, something is wrong.	mazava fa misy zavatra tsy mety
Bigger than life.	lehibe noho ny fiainana
This has never happened before.	tsy mbola nisy izany teo aloha
There is no other way around it.	tsy misy fomba hafa manodidina izany
I was very happy about that.	tena faly aho taminizany
We have pictures together.	manana sary miaraka izahay
They shouldn’t be a problem.	tsy tokony ho olana izy ireo
Maybe just one person.	olona iray ihany angamba
Maybe even better.	mety tsara kokoa aza
There was no one like us today.	tsy nisy toy ny antsika ankehitriny
Nothing came of it.	tsy nisy na inona na inona tonga taminizany
Simple is fast.	ny tsotra dia haingana
Whether good or bad.	na tsara na ratsy
I find that still in the usual way.	hitako fa mbola aminny fomba mahazatra
Maybe you did, but maybe you didn’t.	angamba ianao nanao izany fa angamba tsy nanao izany
It’s an action.	hetsika izy
Because it needs to be very fast.	satria mila haingana be
At the moment, this is not true historically.	aminizao fotoana izao dia tsy marina izany raha ny tantara
All women do that.	ny vehivavy rehetra dia manao izany
But not for long.	tsy ela anefa
I think these are difficult.	heveriko fa sarotra ireo
But it's a nice idea.	hevitra mahafinaritra anefa
History is about everything but nothing.	ny tantara dia momba ny zavadrehetra fa tsy misy
Don’t do them.	aza manao azy ireo
And not just himself.	ary tsy ny tenany ihany
Either way, it’s already common.	na izany na tsy izany efa mahazatra izany
He thought the same way.	nieritreritra toy izany koa izy
Yes, you are wrong.	eny diso hevitra ianao
Real people.	olona tena izy
Less work is needed.	kely kokoa ny asa ilaina
And they all needed jobs.	ary nila asa izy rehetra
You came to me.	tonga amiko ianao
Nothing can be done easily.	tsy misy azo atao mora foana
Do what you want with it.	ataovy izay tianao aminizany
In a lifetime.	aminny fiainana iray
I stopped too.	nijanona koa aho
Work is the first thing in the world.	ny asa no voalohany indrindra eto aminizao tontolo izao
That is the reality.	izany no tena zavamisy
He was probably lost.	very angamba izy
He knows us well.	fantany tsara isika
He seemed very happy to see me.	toa faly be izy nahita ahy
They used to be like that.	toy izany izy ireo taloha
He had time for everyone.	nanana fotoana ho anny rehetra izy
You don't get it.	tsy azonao izany
It’s easy, too.	mora ihany koa izany
He has it.	manana izany izy
There is no step away.	tsy misy dingana lavitra
But that year passed quickly.	lasa haingana anefa izany taona izany
He is very unhappy.	tena tsy faly izy
She is a very beautiful person.	olona tsara tarehy loatra izy
I can't.	tsy afaka aho
That way, everyone is happy.	aminizany fomba izany dia faly ny rehetra
It is a new life.	fiainana vaovao izany
Even though he knew he would do it.	na dia fantany aza fa hanao izany izy
It is not possible.	tsy azo atao
But it’s far better than the other options.	saingy tsara lavitra noho ireo safidy hafa izany
Maybe he was long gone.	angamba efa ela izy no lasa
Easier and easier.	mora kokoa sy mora kokoa
Sometimes they are completely wrong.	indraindray dia diso tanteraka izy ireo
It seems like a difficult task.	toa asa sarotra izany
Maybe, maybe, but maybe not.	mety angamba fa tsy mety
And they stopped.	dia nijanona izy ireo
You don’t make a lot of money.	tsy mahazo vola be ianao
It’s still hard to find it.	mbola sarotra ny mahita azy
I need it for me.	mila izany ho ahy aho
He is not very talkative.	tsy be resaka izy
I don’t want to do it again.	tsy te hanao izany indray aho
I still don’t have anything about him.	mbola tsy manana na inona na inona momba azy aho
Both have them.	samy manana azy ireo
It’s all a lot, but it’s not enough.	be dia be izany rehetra izany saingy tsy ampy
This will never be seen in a big game.	tsy ho hita aminny lalao lehibe mihitsy izany
I like it.	tiako
We will be there then.	ho any isika avy eo
Great stuff around.	zavatra lehibe manodidina
This is the real thing.	izao no tena izy
Maybe at another time.	angamba aminny fotoana hafa
You are the same as before.	toy ny taloha koa ianao
I really like it.	tena tiako ilay izy
These are not the right people.	tsy ireo no olona mety
But it’s not something you can’t generally do.	saingy tsy zavatra tsy azonao atao aminny ankapobeny izany
And that’s really bad.	ary tena ratsy izany
Then it stopped.	dia nijanona izany
They are also very large.	tena lehibe koa izy ireo
He is everything to me.	izy no zavadrehetra ho ahy
That is not the problem right now.	tsy izany no olana aminizao fotoana izao
But not right now.	saingy tsy aminizao fotoana izao
Two in one.	roa aminny iray
You are wrong woman.	diso vehivavy ianao
So maybe that's it.	ka angamba izay no izy
Not sure.	tsy azo antoka
He went too far.	lasa lavitra izy
They are the only ones that are right for you.	izy ireo ihany no mety aminao
It’s always been like that for me.	toy izany foana ny ahy
It was still fun.	mbola nahafinaritra izany
One for each of them.	iray ho anny tsirairay aminizy ireo
But it is too close.	tena akaiky loatra anefa izany
It always seems like that.	toa toy izany foana izany
Simple life is fun.	mahafinaritra ny fiainana tsotra
It doesn't seem right.	toa tsy mety izany
He certainly did.	azo antoka fa nanao izany izy
A new problem came up for them.	nisy olana vaovao tonga teo aminizy ireo
No need, really.	tsy ilaina tena
He hadn't done that in a long time.	efa ela izy no tsy nanao izany
So have it.	koa manana azy
I watched them die.	nijery azy ireo maty aho
From you.	avy aminao
I'm not that yet.	mbola tsy izany aho
They’re certainly not fun.	azo antoka fa tsy mahafinaritra izy ireo
This is another good option for beginners.	safidy tsara iray hafa ho anny vao manomboka izany
It didn’t make much sense, of course.	tsy dia nisy dikany loatra izany mazava ho azy
I have seen this often.	nahita izany matetika aho
He always loved her.	tia azy foana izy
He will be like a man.	ho toy ny lehilahy izy
That’s the part.	izany no ampahany
This one is for me.	ity iray ity ho ahy
Here is a typical one.	ity misy iray mahazatra
It is too early.	mbola aloha be izao
This is probably the best option.	ity angamba no safidy tsara indrindra
This is very bad.	tena ratsy izany
It really is.	tena izany tokoa
I don't think so.	heveriko fa tsy izany
He needs it.	mila izany izy
And look at us now.	ary jereo izao izahay
But they are different.	saingy samy hafa izy ireo
But that is not the only reason.	tsy izay ihany anefa no antony
And he needs me now.	ary mila ahy izy izao
He could have done it.	afaka nanao izany izy
This place was great.	nahafinaritra ity toerana ity
It also seems more complicated.	toa sarotra kokoa koa izany
In fact, there is only one place.	raha ny marina dia iray ihany ny toerana
We are not as difficult as women.	tsy sarotra toy ny vehivavy izahay
There are only three of us.	telo ihany izahay
But he said to me, no.	fa hoy izy tamiko tsia
I have to look further away then first.	tsy maintsy mijery lavitra kokoa aho avy eo aloha
Something else has to go there.	misy zavatra hafa tsy maintsy mandeha any
Often this is not necessary.	matetika dia tsy ilaina izany
You can work and walk.	afaka miasa sy mandeha ianao
This year is different.	hafa ity taona ity
They saw nothing again.	tsy nahita na inona na inona indray izy ireo
This is the most likely reason.	izany no antony mety indrindra
I was finally able to do that.	afaka nanao izany aho taminny farany
He now had a house.	nanana trano izy izao
Others are better, but not always.	ny hafa dia tsara kokoa saingy tsy misy foana
It’s you, or the man.	izany dia ianao na ny lehilahy
Yes, do it now.	eny manao izany izao
That's too much.	be loatra izany
That seems clear.	toa mazava izany
No, that's not the point.	tsia tsy izay no zavadehibe
But that is not all.	tsy izay ihany anefa no tena izy
No, you certainly are not.	tsia azo antoka fa tsy izany ianao
You don’t like it.	tsy tianao izany
He looked at me intently as he said that.	nijery ahy tsara izy rehefa nilaza izany
Not just a part.	tsy ampahany fotsiny
Maybe the process has already begun.	angamba efa nanomboka ny dingana
Something like that.	zavatra toy izany
You love him, you love them both.	tia azy ianao tia azy roa ianao
The world has gone too far.	lasa lavitra be izao tontolo izao
See if it’s more fun.	jereo raha mahafinaritra kokoa
The method is very simple.	ny fomba dia tena tsotra
He really did exist.	tena nisy tokoa izy
It’s also completely wrong.	tena diso tanteraka koa
I think there is some truth to that.	heveriko fa misy marina izany
See it all here.	jereo eto daholo
But he works well.	miasa tsara anefa izy
It is no more.	tsy eo intsony
Make the place your own.	ataovy toy ny anao ny toerana
I know very well.	fantatro tsara
None of this is unusual.	tsy misy aminireo no tsy mahazatra
It is not about us but about them.	tsy momba antsika izany fa momba azy ireo
The house and surroundings are a different story.	ny trano sy ny manodidina dia tantara hafa
So here it goes.	dia izao no mandeha
Sure enough, he was like one.	azo antoka fa toy ny iray izy
It was a very nonsensical story.	tena tantara tsy misy dikany ilay izy
That's not right.	tsy mety izany
You never know.	tsy fantatrao mihitsy
Yes, maybe he is.	eny angamba izy
It could not be done.	tsy azo natao izany
But there is so much more.	mbola betsaka kokoa anefa izany
Money is more important.	ny vola no zavadehibe kokoa
He looked thoughtful.	nijery nieritreritra izy
I think it's good to go.	heveriko fa tsara ny mandeha
It’s about being there.	fa momba ny hoe eo
I love that about it.	tiako izany momba izany
If so, no problem.	raha eny tsy misy olana
I really don’t want it to go away.	tena tsy tiako tsy hisy intsony izany
Then they left.	dia lasa izy ireo
They are all there now.	izy rehetra dia misy ankehitriny
It doesn’t make sense anymore.	tsy misy dikany intsony
You don’t have to do anything special.	tsy mila manao zavatra manokana ianao
I have to get it, you know.	tsy maintsy mahazo azy aho fantatrao
I have to work.	tsy maintsy miasa aho
Well, not only that.	eny ary tsy izany ihany
It will always be a part of me.	ho ampahany amiko foana izany
And he stopped.	dia nijanona izy
Don’t act like you’re not happy to see me.	aza manao toy ny tsy faly mahita ahy
Sounds fun.	toa mahafinaritra
While it turned out to be safe in the end, it wasn’t very good.	na dia hita fa azo antoka aza izany taminny farany dia tsy dia tsara loatra
It is very possible.	tena azo atao izany
He really didn't.	tsy nanao izany tokoa izy
There’s nothing unusual about that either.	tsy misy tsy mahazatra aminizany koa
But it was not meant for us.	saingy tsy natao ho antsika izany
They do the same.	manao izany koa izy ireo
I think it’s just for me.	heveriko ho ahy fotsiny izany
It always comes down to the same thing.	tonga hatrany aminny zavatra mitovy
Maybe it doesn’t even exist.	angamba tsy misy akory izany
The day became meaningless.	lasa tsy nisy dikany ny andro
It’s very special.	tena manokana izany
I told him not to come to this place.	nilaza taminy aho mba tsy ho tonga eto aminity toerana ity
Confused, he could not get out of his first place.	very hevitra izy ka tsy afaka taminny toerana voalohany nisy azy
There is no end to the ideas.	tsy misy farany ny hevitra
They looked good before.	nijery tsara izy ireo teo aloha
Some even do both.	misy mihitsy aza ny manao azy roa
At first, there was no money.	taminny voalohany dia tsy nisy ny vola
It's fast.	haingana izany
That alone is not enough.	izay ihany no tsy ampy
I am very happy for him.	tena faly aho ho azy
I have to have it with me.	tsy maintsy manana izany miaraka amiko aho
But, it’s gone.	saingy lasa izany
That's enough.	ampy izany
Especially when there are no results at all.	indrindra rehefa tsy misy mihitsy ny vokatra azo
It seems too hard.	toa mafy loatra izany
We have nothing in it.	tsy manana na inona na inona izahay ao
Just part of the game.	ampahany fotsiny aminny lalao
All good work.	asa tsara daholo
But this does not seem to be the case.	toa tsy izany anefa no izy
If they don’t know it.	raha tsy fantany izany
I have good news.	manana vaovao tsara aho
But not more than enough.	saingy tsy mihoatra ny ampy
Life does not go that way.	tsy mandeha toy izany ny fiainana
Glad you didn’t have that problem.	faly ianao fa tsy nanana izany olana izany
It seems to be meant to be.	toa natao ho izy io
There are many reasons.	maro ny antony
You know we do.	fantatrao fa manao izany izahay
The endless war.	ny ady tsy misy farany
So we are the same.	ka mitovy isika
This product is a very good product.	ity vokatra ity dia vokatra tena tsara
I think everyone came.	heveriko fa tonga daholo ny olona rehetra
It is personal and special.	izy io dia manokana sy manokana
I really liked it in my first year.	tena tiako ilay izy taminny taona voalohany
It doesn’t make much sense.	tsy dia misy dikany loatra
Some you will like more than others.	ny sasany dia ho tianao kokoa noho ny hafa
I need to draw more.	mila manao sary bebe kokoa aho
In fact, this is not true.	raha ny marina tsy marina izany
It's not like him.	tsy toa azy ilay izy
You have to go as fast as possible.	tsy maintsy mandeha haingana araka izay azo atao
He is not like you.	tsy mitovy aminao izy
This is because.	izany dia satria
I expect nothing.	tsy manantena na inona na inona aho
That’s where it starts.	eo no manomboka
There is nothing you can do to me.	tsy misy azonao atao amiko
No, no problem at all.	tsia tsy misy olana mihitsy
He almost died.	saika maty izy
The first image is from one of these games.	ny sary voalohany dia avy aminny iray aminireo lalao ireo
It’s for him personally.	ho azy manokana izany
And yes, that's right.	ary eny marina izany
He seems to be dead.	toa maty izy
Each journey is an individual journey.	ny dia tsirairay dia dia tsirairay
In fact, there is no problem at all.	raha ny marina tsy misy olana mihitsy
Clearly, this is not the case here.	mazava fa tsy izany no zavamisy eto
We will be gone.	tsy hisy intsony isika
I always looked at him.	nijery azy foana aho
But that's what it is.	fa izay no izy
Bad, bad stuff.	ratsy zavatra ratsy
You were always there.	teo foana ianao
We need more people for that.	mila olona maro kokoa izahay aminizany
But he still needs someone.	mbola mila olona iray ihany anefa izy
It's too special.	tena manokana loatra ilay izy
It is a matter of choice.	resaka safidy io
In any case.	na izany na tsy izany
It may not be the other way around.	mety tsy ho fomba hafa izany
It was a wonderful time for him.	fotoana mahafinaritra ho azy izany
Now he will do it.	ankehitriny dia hanao izany izy
Here is the question.	ity ny fanontaniana
He came to me.	tonga tamiko izy
There was none.	tsy nisy izany
He can't have.	tsy afaka manana izy
With other women.	miaraka aminny vehivavy hafa
That might be good for him.	mety ho tsara ho azy izany
For you too.	ho anao koa
Not a little.	tsy kely akory
So we had more time inside.	noho izany dia nanana fotoana bebe kokoa tao anatiny izahay
But the facts are not the same.	tsy mitovy anefa ny zavamisy
Which is a pretty good thing.	izay zavatra somary tsara
It's simpler.	tsotra kokoa ilay izy
One is not history, one is history.	ny iray tsy tantara ny iray no tantara
But overall great.	fa aminny ankapobeny lehibe
So, it’s really good.	noho izany dia tena tsara
But they are still different.	mbola hafa ihany anefa izy ireo
Still to come.	mbola ho avy
Then only you are safe.	dia ianao ihany no azo antoka
Anything that can happen.	izay rehetra mety hisy
I don’t do that anymore.	tsy manao izany intsony aho
But it is not the house that is important.	tsy ny trano anefa no zavadehibe
Life is not easy.	tsy mora ny fiainana
I hate it.	tsy tiako izany
Well, thank you very much.	tsara misaotra betsaka
So glad you were able to do that.	faly be fa afaka nanao izany ianao
I was really bad then.	tena ratsy be aho taminizany
You're great.	mahafinaritra ianao
It is almost always full.	saika feno foana izy io
It’s exactly the same.	mitovy tanteraka izany
All these games.	ireo lalao rehetra ireo
But this has happened before.	efa nisy toy izany anefa teo aloha
And many are.	ary maro no
If they do.	raha manao izany izy ireo
And that's how it should be.	ary izany no tokony ho izy
One at a time or both.	iray aminny fotoana iray na izy roa
Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn’t.	mandeha izany indraindray ary indraindray tsy mandeha
What are we.	inona isika
He was no more, of course.	tsy teo intsony izy mazava ho azy
Lots of money.	vola be dia be
At first, they may look like that, for sure.	aminny voalohany dia mety ho toa izany izy ireo azo antoka
There is nothing special between me and you.	tsy misy zavatra manokana eo amiko sy ianao
But there is another problem.	saingy misy olana hafa
However, they are not suitable for cars.	na izany aza tsy mety aminny fiara izy ireo
There are two parts to this.	misy ampahany roa aminizany
This is not for beginners.	tsy natao ho anny vao manomboka izany
It is wrong or unworthy.	tsy mety na tsy mendrika izany
He wants to make news.	te hanao vaovao izy
It was wrong then and it is wrong now.	diso izany taloha ary diso ankehitriny
But if you had.	fa raha nanana ianao
All of these places seem to be dead.	toa efa maty daholo ireo toerana ireo
Whatever the reason.	na inona na inona antony
Just do it.	ataovy fotsiny
They are very new.	tena vaovao izy ireo
He seems insignificant and insignificant.	toa tsy misy dikany sy tsy misy dikany izy
She couldn't say anything to him.	tsy afaka nilaza na inona na inona taminy izy
He could not do that.	tsy afaka nanao izany izy
The other three methods are better.	ireo fomba telo hafa dia tsara kokoa
He didn't even think he knew it.	tsy nieritreritra akory izy fa fantany izany
And that's not true.	ary tsy marina izany
There is now.	misy izao
I have never seen it come.	tsy mbola nahita izany ho avy
It can make things fun and easy.	afaka manao zavatra mahafinaritra sy mora izany
For the big day.	ho anny andro lehibe
It’s not even a conversation about that.	tsy mbola resaka momba izany ihany
Many people died.	olona maro no maty
I don’t need to have it.	tsy mila manana azy aho
You can never do enough.	tsy afaka manao ny ampy mihitsy ianao
He saw it for himself.	nahita izany ho azy izy
But this is very bad.	tena ratsy anefa izany
This is very important.	tena zavadehibe tokoa izany
You must have told him.	tsy maintsy ianao no nilaza taminy
People disagree.	tsy mitovy hevitra ny olona
He soon had a prominent position as well.	tsy ela dia nanana toerana lehibe koa izy
We need him.	mila azy izahay
Now we are alone.	ankehitriny isika irery
To talk to him once.	mba hanao resaka indray mandeha aminy
He is very alone now.	tena irery izy izao
That’s true, if not so true.	marina izany raha tsy dia marina loatra
The years went by.	nandeha ny taona
There is something wrong with it.	misy zavatra tsy mety ao
It’s even worse.	ratsy kokoa izany
Men also don’t really see it as something else.	ny lehilahy koa tsy tena mahita azy ho zavatra hafa
Done a little now and then.	natao kely izao sy izao
I really like him.	tena tiako izy
They are not difficult.	tsy sarotra izy ireo
She was a small woman, very beautiful.	vehivavy kely izy tena tsara tarehy

Looks like where we are now.	toa ny toerana nisy anay ankehitriny
We need to act fast.	mila miasa haingana isika
Thank you for doing that.	misaotra anao nanao izany
Yes, he can.	eny mety izy
At the right time.	aminny fotoana mety
I think that’s the most appropriate.	heveriko fa mety indrindra izany
Or somewhere far away in the news.	na toerana hafa lavitra aminny vaovao
Look again.	jereo indray
Some of them are clearly visible and some are not.	ny sasany aminizy ireo dia hita tsara ary ny sasany tsy
Or if you die.	na raha maty ianao
They are different.	samy hafa izy ireo
They must have done so a long time ago.	tokony ho efa ela no nanao izany izy ireo
We hope others will do the same.	manantena izahay fa hanao toy izany koa ny hafa
No words from him.	tsy misy teny avy aminy
It’s not an overnight job.	tsy asa indray alina izany
Well, part of it.	eny ary ampahany aminizany
Three people were killed.	olona telo no maty
I am with them.	miaraka aminizy ireo aho
History is everywhere.	eny rehetra eny ny tantara
The simplest thing.	zavatra tsotra indrindra
They must come.	tsy maintsy ho avy izy ireo

Everything is lost, and then some.	very ny zavadrehetra ary avy eo ny sasany
This is usually a process.	matetika dia dingana iray izany
We are all the same.	mitovy daholo isika rehetra
A little crazy.	adala kely
Thank him.	misaotra azy
Then again, it may not be a good idea.	avy eo indray mety tsy hevitra tsara
They are very easy.	tena mora izy ireo
Because you know you’re better off with them.	satria fantatrao fa tsara kokoa ianao miaraka aminizy ireo
There was no room for anything else, he told himself.	tsy nisy toerana ho anny zavatra hafa hoy izy taminny tenany
There was a way of saying that.	nisy fomba nilaza izany
But they may not even need it.	mety tsy mila izany akory anefa izy ireo
You are only one.	iray ihany ianao
It seemed perfect to me.	toa tanteraka tamiko izany
I may have done something wrong.	mety nisy zavatra diso aho
He had to stop doing his own thing.	tsy maintsy nijanona tsy nanao ny azy intsony izy
Maybe that’s right for you.	angamba mety aminao izany
We have no problem with that idea.	tsy manana olana aminizany hevitra izany isika
It's a real picture.	sary marina ilay izy
Apparently this is not possible.	hita fa tsy tanteraka izany
I should do the same.	tokony hanao toy izany koa aho
What is easy for some, may be difficult for others.	izay mora ho anny sasany mety ho sarotra ho anny hafa
It seems so.	toa toy izany
Which he already knows now.	izay efa fantany izao
Not at all, he told her.	tsy izany mihitsy hoy izy taminy
And about others.	ary ny aminny hafa
What a great one.	inona no lehibe

Of course, this product is not new.	mazava ho azy fa tsy vaovao io vokatra io
And each of them is doing a decent job.	ary ny tsirairay aminizy ireo dia manao asa mendrika

And those who can’t or can’t, won’t.	ary ireo izay tsy afaka na tsy afaka dia tsy hanao
There won't be much talk tonight.	tsy hisy resaka be anio alina
But it doesn’t really matter to me.	saingy tsy dia ilaina loatra amiko izany
He looked at her carefully.	nijery azy tsara izy
The car seemed to be empty.	toa tsy nisy na inona na inona ilay fiara
I’m really glad they work so hard.	tena faly aho fa tena miasa mafy izy ireo

Very feminine.	tena vehivavy

We couldn’t do that.	tsy afaka nanao izany izahay

He was confused.	very hevitra izy
If so, you have other ideas.	raha eny manana hevitra hafa ianao
That’s probably why.	izany angamba no antony

People love him.	tia azy ny olona
Too little.	kely loatra
Or not go when you want.	na tsy mandeha rehefa tianao
He saw no one.	tsy nahita olona izy
He deserves that man.	mendrika izany lehilahy izany izy
But then, so did he.	saingy avy eo toy izany koa izy
.	
And that may be true.	ary mety ho marina izany
That’s a good thing for him.	zavatra tsara ho azy izany
History is made.	atao ny tantara

Thank you for starting this conversation.	misaotra anao nanomboka ity resaka ity

The big ones come with time.	tonga miaraka aminny fotoana ny lehibe
That’s the best thing.	izany no zavatra tsara indrindra
But it must make sense.	tsy maintsy misy dikany anefa izany
I have no problem with that at all.	tsy manana olana mihitsy aho aminizany
I've been there before.	efa tany aho taloha
You have nothing to lose if you don’t work.	tsy misy ho very ianao raha tsy miasa
It was there that he was most happy.	teo izy no tena faly
I think that was always the idea in him.	heveriko fa izany foana no hevitra tao aminy
I don't need anything.	tsy mila na inona na inona aho
He has three more.	manana telo hafa izy
It works even when time is of the essence.	miasa izy io na dia tsy misy dikany aza ny fotoana
Designed to be complete.	natao ho fomba feno
Of course, this is just a personal opinion.	mazava ho azy fa hevitra manokana fotsiny izany
I want him to be better than he is.	tiako ho tsara kokoa noho izy izy
And the first woman.	ary ny vehivavy voalohany

Someone you should know.	olona tokony ho fantatrao
Kind of normal, not like you.	karazana mahazatra tsy toa anao
It’s a really good job.	tena asa tsara izany

It’s all very appropriate.	tena mety daholo
They both need to work.	mila miasa izy roa
Yes, some fools do it wrong.	eny misy adala manao izany tsy mety
In and of themselves, they will never do that.	ao aminny tenany sy ny tenany dia tsy hanao izany mihitsy izy ireo
You are the problem.	ianao no olana
His only.	ny azy ihany
Maybe all of them and others.	angamba izy rehetra sy ny hafa
Maybe you already have.	angamba ianao efa manana
More needs to be done.	mila atao bebe kokoa
These are made better.	ireo dia natao tsara kokoa
You can do this at night.	afaka manao izany aminny alina ianao
He is underage.	tsy ampy taona izy
I almost lost.	saika ho very aho
He’s just not like me.	tsy mitovy amiko fotsiny izy
I want to make sure it’s safe.	tiako ho azo antoka fa azo antoka
I thought that was it.	nieritreritra aho fa izany no izy
Both are happy.	samy faly
But only a little.	kely ihany anefa
This is the last one.	io no farany
He got there.	tonga teo izy
For one thing, though, you have to be sure.	ny aminny zavatra iray anefa dia tokony ho azo antoka
No option seems better than the other.	tsy misy safidy toa tsara kokoa noho ny hafa
She is a woman.	vehivavy izy
In fact, it even seemed necessary.	eny tokoa toa nila izany mihitsy aza
This turned out to be possible.	izany dia hita fa mety
So, check out this game.	noho izany jereo ity lalao ity
He walked fast.	nandeha haingana izy
The world will be a better place when he is gone.	toerana tsara kokoa izao tontolo izao rehefa lasa izy
Yes, they are.	eny eo izy ireo
Surely everything will be discovered soon.	azo antoka fa ho hita tsy ho ela ny zavadrehetra
So it was important for us to get started.	noho izany dia zavadehibe ho antsika ny nanomboka
Start a car that won’t do it.	manomboka fiara izay tsy hanao izany
But this is not possible.	tsy azo atao anefa izany
I think it should be.	heveriko fa tokony ho izany
They are too many.	be loatra izy ireo
He wanted to be close.	te ho akaiky akaiky izy
A simple life is not bad at all.	tsy ratsy mihitsy ny fiainana tsotra
Just for him.	ho azy fotsiny
There was a lot of action.	nisy hetsika be dia be
We have time now.	manana fotoana isika izao
He doesn't like me very much.	tsy dia tia ahy loatra izy
No one was watching.	tsy nisy nijery
Not for you.	tsy ho anao
Look, here’s the latest, important news.	jereo ity misy vaovao farany zavadehibe
Difficult question.	fanontaniana sarotra
Really fun.	tena mahafinaritra
Then, came my favorite part.	avy eo tonga ny ampahany tiako indrindra
Have, don’t like.	manana tsy tia
As you can probably understand.	araka ny mety ho azonao tsara
And perhaps the biggest reason is money.	ary angamba ny antony lehibe indrindra dia ny vola
If possible.	raha azo atao izany
But it might be the best.	saingy mety ho ny tsara indrindra izany
But of course it is a personal choice.	saingy mazava ho azy fa safidy manokana izany
There is no other way.	tsy misy fomba hafa
Much better.	tena tsara kokoa
It could be very meaningful.	mety ho tena dikany
He doesn’t have the right things.	tsy manana ny zavatra mety izy
Anyway, good job !.	na izany na tsy izany asa tsara
This works well for me.	ity dia miasa tsara amiko
Do it over and over again.	manao izany hatrany hatrany hatrany
That’s definitely good.	azo antoka fa tsara izany

Finally, something happened to him.	farany nisy zavatra tonga taminy
The place is really bad.	tena ratsy ny toerana
Even if you are a lot.	na dia be aza ianao
Or very simply.	na tena tsotra
Some of them are not fun.	ny sasany aminizy ireo dia tsy mahafinaritra

None of these right now, but maybe.	tsy misy ireo aminizao fotoana izao saingy mety
But it's not.	saingy tsy izany
In battle you need speed.	aminny ady dia mila haingana ianao
We have a house there.	manana trano any izahay
Which, of course, he is.	izay mazava ho azy dia izy
Not good, but good.	tsy tsara fa tsara
I don't need money.	tsy mila vola aho
Of course, the situation is different.	mazava ho azy fa hafa ny zavamisy aminny zavamisy
It is not necessary.	tsy ilaina izany
He almost didn’t like it.	saika tsy tiany izany
In fact, no one comes that way anymore.	raha ny marina tsy misy olona tonga toy izany intsony
I have to hurry.	tsy maintsy ho haingana aho
But that is too much.	be loatra anefa izany
She is the kind of woman that all women are.	izy no karazana vehivavy izay vehivavy rehetra
So as usual, men are the problem.	ka toy ny mahazatra dia ny lehilahy no olana
It is a difficult task.	asa sarotra izany
He wanted everything to be as it should be.	tiany ho araka ny tokony ho izy ny zavadrehetra
Words are not enough now.	tsy ampy ny teny ankehitriny
He never had a choice.	tsy nanana safidy mihitsy izy
We had good reason.	nanana antony tsara izahay
It's a crazy house.	trano adala io
I need more of these.	mila bebe kokoa aminireo aho

But you still have it.	saingy mbola manana izany ianao
I know some.	fantatro ny sasany
It doesn't work.	tsy mety
Many women have.	maro ny vehivavy manana
Like the last one.	toy ny farany
This is also not true.	tsy marina koa izany
He may have died.	efa maty angamba izy
And some days are bad.	ary ratsy ny andro sasany
Yes yes yes.	eny eny eny
It really means something to me.	tena misy dikany amiko
And they are right.	ary marina ireo
That’s a lot, too.	be dia be koa izany
Now that is not the case.	ankehitriny dia tsy izany no izy
This is probably the biggest.	izany angamba no lehibe indrindra
You get news for him.	mahazo vaovao ho azy ianao
Sure, some may be smaller, but they are there.	azo antoka fa mety ho kely kokoa ny sasany saingy misy izy ireo
It is one thing to be right.	zavatra iray ny hoe marina
They both just looked at me.	nijery ahy fotsiny izy roa
It is never enough.	tsy ampy mihitsy izany
He is all dead.	efa maty daholo izy
They were certainly there.	azo antoka fa teo izy ireo
This is more than a far cry.	izany dia mihoatra noho ny mety lavitra
Of course not then.	mazava ho azy fa tsy taminizany
It was all there.	teo daholo ny tao
I know your type.	fantatro ny karazana anao
It’s a good food choice.	safidy sakafo mety izy io
But what he really likes is women.	ny tena tiany anefa dia vehivavy
This is another man.	lehilahy hafa io

There you are.	misy ianao
And life was hard there.	ary sarotra ny fiainana tany
It has everything.	manana ny zavadrehetra izy io
But it is in the wrong place.	diso toerana anefa izy io
He is not alone.	tsy irery izy
It was a lot of fun.	nahafinaritra be ilay izy
The idea became obsolete.	lasa tsy ilaina intsony ilay hevitra
They will soon be.	tsy ho ela izy ireo
By himself.	aminny tenany
But nothing is true.	tsy misy marina anefa
No he said and left.	tsia hoy izy dia lasa
It turns out that this is always possible.	hita fa azo atao foana izany
And it shouldn’t be.	ary tsy tokony ho
Sometimes men have to walk.	tsy maintsy mandeha ihany ny lehilahy indraindray
I hope it is there.	manantena aho fa ao izany
Because of course no one can do all that.	satria mazava ho azy fa tsy misy afaka manao izany rehetra izany
It seems familiar and familiar.	toa mahazatra sy mahazatra izany
And a real man.	ary tena lehilahy
There’s nothing you don’t like.	tsy misy zavatra tsy tianao
And if a woman.	ary raha vehivavy
And he did it again.	dia nanao izany indray izy
I find it all too much for me.	hitako fa be loatra amiko izany rehetra izany

You know there will always be.	fantatrao fa hisy foana izany
I'm watching the news.	mijery ny vaovao aho
There is simply no place.	tsy misy toerana tsotra izao
Then the conversation went on again.	dia nandeha indray ny resaka
I always have that.	manana anio foana aho
No part of it is unnecessary.	tsy misy ampahany aminy tsy ilaina
Maybe better.	angamba tsara kokoa
But even so, it’s great.	saingy na izany aza dia lehibe izany
Many are very good.	maro no tena tsara
You really aren’t that hard.	tena tsy dia mafy loatra ianao
She is malnourished.	tsy ampy sakafo izy
You have to look at everything.	tsy maintsy mijery ny zavadrehetra
He often does bad things.	matetika izy no manao ratsy
We need you.	mila anao izahay
That was no problem either.	tsy nisy olana koa izany
This is not a typical meal.	tsy sakafo mahazatra izany
This is not uncommon.	tsy mahazatra izany
You can go.	afaka mandeha ianao
But the real problem is food.	ny sakafo anefa no tena olana
Not too much in other houses.	tsy dia be loatra aminny trano hafa
One day they will come.	indray andro any dia ho avy izy ireo
Or anyone can.	na misy afaka
Not everything is good for you.	tsy tsara ny zavadrehetra aminao
But it will all come.	saingy ho avy izany rehetra izany
You made that move.	nanao izany hetsika izany ianao
He looked around and left quickly.	nijery ny manodidina izy ary lasa nandeha haingana
It doesn’t make sense.	tsy misy dikany izany
They are all lost.	very izy rehetra
He must be dead.	tokony ho efa maty
And he went.	dia nandeha izy
Every word has meaning.	ny teny rehetra dia misy dikany
And thought more.	ary nieritreritra bebe kokoa
This is especially true in war.	marina indrindra izany aminny ady
The battle is the same.	mitovy ihany ny ady
Despite this, nothing was done.	na dia teo aza izany dia tsy nisy natao
But even so, nothing is certain.	saingy na izany aza tsy misy azo antoka
He may be lost when he arrives.	mety ho very izy rehefa tonga
For him and for her.	ho azy sy ho azy
He is superior.	izy no ambony
See more.	jereo hafa
And it could be so again.	ary mety ho toy izany indray
Someone saw him.	nisy nahita azy
And that’s not a problem for me at all.	ary tsy olana amiko mihitsy izany
It’s not easy, though.	tsy mora izany na dia izany aza
I was so happy to get it.	faly be aho nahazo izany
If you know, you know.	raha fantatrao dia fantatrao
And for you too, of course.	ary ho anao koa mazava ho azy
I can't have that.	tsy afaka manana izany aho
His position was difficult.	sarotra ny toerana nisy azy
But that is not enough.	saingy tsy ampy izany
The place is very familiar.	tena mahazatra ilay toerana
And now I am.	ary izao aho izao
He didn’t know, because he didn’t need it.	tsy fantany satria tsy nila izany
This is where my problem lies.	eto no misy ny olana amiko
That is one reason.	antony iray izany
He loved her but didn’t love her.	tiany izy fa tsy tia azy
They really get it.	tena mahazo izany izy ireo
Something low was done.	zavatra ambany no natao
This little one needs you.	mila anao io kely io
And there is a reason for that.	ary misy antony izany
I don’t want to do anything else.	tsy te hanao zavatra hafa aho
Maybe not.	angamba tsy izany
This is good overall.	tsara izany aminny ankapobeny
It should be great.	tokony ho lehibe
Yes it works.	eny miasa izany
Of course, this is true.	mazava ho azy fa marina izany
Of course.	mazava ho azy izany
You can have a lot of fun when you want to.	mety ho mahafinaritra be ianao rehefa tianao
Although there is.	na dia misy aza izany
It works well and we are very happy.	miasa tsara izy io ary tena faly izahay
She is a very beautiful woman.	tena vehivavy tsara tarehy tokoa
It was good at first.	tsara izany taminny voalohany
And you are confused.	ary very hevitra ianao
The big event.	ny hetsika lehibe
That's just the way it is in reality.	izany ihany no zavamisy taminny zavamisy
But that doesn't make sense.	tsy misy dikany anefa izany
This method works better for us.	miasa tsara kokoa ho antsika izany fomba izany
Together, of course.	miaraka mazava ho azy
Too much, actually.	be loatra raha ny marina
It doesn’t seem to make sense.	toa tsy misy dikany izany
It was hard to find the time.	sarotra ny nahita ny fotoana
I don't need anything from him.	tsy mila na inona na inona aminy aho
She’s fun.	mahafinaritra izy
If that’s true, we’re here.	raha marina izany dia tonga izahay
Yes, not with new people.	eny tsy miaraka aminny olona vaovao
He’s very much in it.	tena be dia be izy
Now it’s not the same.	ankehitriny dia tsy mitovy izany
Either way, or worse.	na izany na ratsy kokoa
Otherwise, they will know what is in it.	raha tsy izany dia ho fantany izay ao anatiny
Yes, it is all there.	eny ao daholo izany
But we have a good idea.	manana hevitra tsara anefa izahay
Yes, some women.	eny vehivavy sasany
Or a lot of other things.	na betsaka ny zavatra hafa
But sometimes they can be necessary.	saingy indraindray dia mety ho ilaina izy ireo
I have to have a reason.	tsy maintsy manana antony aho
Yes, nothing is going on here.	eny tsy mandeha na inona na inona eto
You already told me.	efa nilaza tamiko ianao
That day started like any other day.	nanomboka toy ny andro rehetra izany andro izany
It's tough.	mafy ilay izy
I don't think he saw it.	heveriko fa tsy nahita izy
This is different.	hafa ihany ity
Not like them at all.	tsy toa azy ireo mihitsy
You can just do it now.	azonao atao fotsiny izao
Then he died.	dia maty izy
I just don’t expect me.	tsy manantena ahy fotsiny aho
Or you may need one.	na mety mila iray ianao
There’s even more potential.	mbola betsaka kokoa ny mety
And in the right place.	ary aminny toerana mety
So is mine.	toy izany koa ny ahy
Or just.	na fotsiny
You have enough time.	manana fotoana ampy ianao
These are just words.	teny ihany ireo
The first step is not good.	ny dingana voalohany dia tsy tsara
This is wrong.	diso izany
This is bad.	ratsy izany
The latter went on to do the same.	nandeha nanao anio ihany koa ny farany
I still have it.	mbola manana izany aho
I like that!.	tiako izany
It was too small.	kely loatra ilay izy
Maybe he could have another one.	angamba afaka manana iray hafa izy
That’s more money for us.	izany dia vola bebe kokoa ho antsika
Everything if.	ny zavadrehetra raha
Hope for the best.	manantena ny tsara indrindra
Handsome man.	lehilahy tsara tarehy
It’s like me and him.	toa ahy sy izy izany
The two ideas are actually together.	ny hevitra roa raha ny marina dia miaraka
It's not far.	tsy lavitra izany
Everything inside is true.	marina daholo ny ao anatiny
Basically we will do the following.	aminny ankapobeny dia hanao izao manaraka izao isika
We hope there will be no problems.	manantena izahay fa tsy hisy olana
Everything is different.	hafa ny zavadrehetra
You may be next.	mety ho ianao no manaraka
Something is wrong here.	misy zavatra tsy mety ka
Far from home.	lavitra ny trano
Too much of the above.	be loatra ny ambony
Otherwise, it can be done more often.	raha tsy izany dia azo atao matetika kokoa izany
But only in part.	fa ampahany ihany
It may not matter.	tsy zavadehibe angamba ilay izy
And he was the first.	ary izy no voalohany
The last three are not like that.	tsy toy izany ny telo farany
It was a little something then.	zavatra kely kokoa izany taminizany
No one could do that.	tsy nisy olona afaka nanao izany
Otherwise, they are no longer alone.	raha tsy izany dia tsy azy irery intsony izy ireo
This is perfect for you.	tena mety aminao izany
They didn't even see him.	tsy nahita azy akory izy ireo
This is wrong for two reasons.	diso izany noho ny antony roa
I only have one.	manana iray fotsiny
Or mine.	na ny ahy
Working or not working.	miasa na tsy miasa
You can have pictures.	afaka manana sary ianao
To me, this issue is completely wrong.	amiko dia diso tanteraka io resaka io
Not such a good idea.	tsy hevitra tsara toy izany
He finally got the news.	nahazo vaovao ihany izy taminny farany
Following is the final result.	manaraka izao ny vokatra farany
They arrive faster and faster.	haingana sy haingana kokoa izy ireo tonga
He may have seen something.	mety nahita zavatra izy
But these are not the only facts.	tsy ireo ihany anefa no zavamisy
So it's one.	ka iray izany
But it will always be tough.	saingy ho mafy foana izany
For both of us.	ho antsika roa
This is not a new idea.	tsy hevitra vaovao izany
It’s too hard to do.	sarotra loatra ny manao izany
You can see them all here.	afaka mahita azy rehetra eto ianao
He saw some cars.	nahita fiara sasany izy
He stopped short.	nijanona tsy nijanona izy
The man was not far away.	tsy lavitra ilay lehilahy
Especially women or women.	indrindra fa vehivavy na vehivavy
You get two.	mahazo roa ianao
He has his own.	manana ny azy izy
Everyone does it.	samy manao izany ny tsirairay
No, not all of them.	tsia tsy izy rehetra
But so is his.	fa toy izany koa ny azy
The end is not here yet.	tsy mbola eto ny farany
There is money.	misy ny vola
If we have one, he is lost.	raha manana iray isika dia very izy
Especially the story.	indrindra fa ny tantara
I need you to do that.	mila anao aho hanao izany
In fact, you can’t really understand it without it.	raha ny marina tsy azonao tsara izany raha tsy misy azy
But he didn't like it.	tsy tiany anefa izany
I love it all.	tiako daholo
It’s a whole lot of war.	resaka ady tanteraka izany
We usually do one of two things.	aminny ankapobeny dia manao iray aminireo zavatra roa isika
Simpler time.	fotoana tsotra kokoa
A lot of work was done.	tena asa be dia be no natao
We are starting to do that now.	manomboka manao izany isika izao
I am confused at this stage.	very hevitra aho aminity dingana ity
I looked about myself.	nijery ny momba ahy aho
And it is still true.	ary mbola marina izany
Ups and downs.	ny ambony sy ny ambany
What action.	hetsika inona
That’s why it didn’t do anything worthwhile.	izany no tsy nanao na inona na inona ho mendrika
A little early.	kely aloha
It’s simple and works.	tsotra izy io ary miasa
This is true when we die.	marina izany rehefa maty isika
it was a crazy night.	alina adala izany
Not because it's good.	tsy hoe satria tsara ilay izy
Not just love.	tsy hoe tia fotsiny
Those days are long gone.	efa ela ireo andro ireo
Not like the right time, and all.	tsy toy ny fotoana mety ary ny rehetra
There isn’t even a little bit of it.	tsy misy na dia kely aza izany
I looked the other way.	nijery ny lalana hafa aho
I’m confused by the ups and downs.	very hevitra ny ambony sy ny ambany aho
As for the war, so it is between them.	raha ny momba ny ady dia toy izany ny eo aminizy ireo
It was there too.	teo koa izy io
Maybe he just loves me.	angamba izy tia ahy fotsiny
He didn't seem to like it either.	toa tsy tiany koa izany
He looks at her.	mijery azy izy
Very good.	tena tsara
We don’t want to do that.	tsy te hanao izany izahay
This is not a simple war.	tsy ady tsotra izany
Good idea, but not really true.	hevitra tsara fa tsy tena marina
There is something else as well.	misy zavatra hafa koa
There is nothing new in it.	tsy misy zavatra vaovao ao anatiny
I can do one or the other.	afaka manao iray na iray hafa aho
He will always come.	ho avy foana izy
You have to work.	tsy maintsy hanao asa ianao
No one sees anything.	tsy misy mahita na inona na inona
We can only do that once.	indray mandeha ihany isika no afaka manao izany
I had no idea if that could be the case.	tsy nanana hevitra aho raha mety hisy aminizany
It has always been there.	efa nisy foana io
Look, there he is.	jereo eo izy
It’s not good for me either.	tsy tsara amiko koa izany
No more work.	tsy misy asa intsony
It simply doesn’t make sense.	tsy misy dikany tsotra izao izany
This is often the case.	matetika izany
Time is too hard.	mafy loatra ny fotoana
Lots of time.	be ny fotoana
However, this is the simplest.	na izany aza io no tsotra indrindra
It works but not very well.	mandeha izany saingy tsy dia tsara loatra
It has to be there.	tsy maintsy misy izany
They seemed to have enough space.	toa nanana toerana ampy izy ireo
Which is wrong.	izay tsy mety
Yes, they can be difficult at first.	eny mety ho sarotra aminny voalohany izy ireo
So we have to do something about it.	noho izany dia tsy maintsy manao zavatra momba izany isika
It must not be easy to do so.	tsy maintsy hoe tsy mora ny manao izany
I had to think of something.	tsy maintsy nieritreritra zavatra aho
You and he are not stupid.	ianao ary izy tsy adala
Of course not.	tsia mazava ho azy
Maybe not all, but many.	tsy ny rehetra angamba fa maro
Not about a man.	tsy momba ny lehilahy iray
That was all there was.	izay ihany no nisy
I looked at him.	nijery azy aho
And of course, many handsome men will do them.	ary mazava ho azy lehilahy tsara tarehy maro no hanao azy ireo
It’s really fun.	tena mahafinaritra izany
He may never exist.	mety tsy hisy mihitsy izy
In fact, I don’t see it.	raha ny marina tsy mahita izany
But he seemed happy.	toa faly anefa izy
Or it could have been.	na mety nisy izany
This is not a problem at all.	tsy olana mihitsy izany
Make sure you know if yours is one of them.	ataovy azo antoka fa fantatrao raha iray aminizy ireo ny anao
It was very different.	hafa mihitsy ilay izy
It is sometimes.	dia indraindray
It’s not that much.	tsy dia maro izany
I really looked at this thing.	tena nijery anio zavatra io aho
I love the next one.	tiako ny manaraka
But this seems to be true.	toa marina anefa izany
This is very fast.	ity dia tena haingana
If he does anything.	raha manao na inona na inona izy
Others do the same.	manao toy izany koa ny hafa
That's better.	tsara kokoa izany
It may be time consuming but it is not enough.	mety ho fotoana ilaina izany saingy tsy ampy izany
I looked at me.	nijery ahy aho
He knew they would soon be gone.	fantany fa tsy ho ela izy ireo dia tsy ho hita
There are a lot of things that can go wrong.	betsaka ny zavatra mety ho diso
I think they will.	heveriko fa hanao izany izy ireo
When it comes.	rehefa tonga izany
This is often not a good idea.	matetika dia tsy hevitra tsara izany
That's where it is.	eo no misy azy
But this is not right.	tsy mety anefa izany
At this time or not.	aminity fotoana ity na tsia
I want to be alone.	te ho irery
It's you.	ianao io
It was always there.	foana tokoa ilay izy
He is not happy.	tsy faly izy
But life is not easy.	tsy mora anefa ity fiainana ity
Yes, it is not that simple.	eny tsy dia tsotra izany
Maybe it will be easier for you.	angamba ho mora kokoa aminao izany
It’s even harder than dying.	sarotra kokoa noho ny maty aza
That was no problem.	tsy nisy olana izany
He knows what he knows.	fantany izay fantany
I know they will simply love you too.	fantatro fa ho tia anao tsotra ihany koa izy ireo
Or better yet.	na tsara kokoa noho izany
In the end, we didn't all stay in one place.	farany tsy nijanona teo aminny toerana iray ihany izahay rehetra
I can do it again.	afaka manao izany indray aho
However, at first.	na izany aza taminny voalohany
And then? 	ary avy eo
he thought.	hoy izy nieritreritra
It was just a fun time.	fotoana mahafinaritra fotsiny izany
Hard on him.	mafy aminy
I already know that.	efa fantatro izany
So you can come.	ka afaka tonga
I know this man.	fantatro io lehilahy io
Both women make stories.	samy vehivavy manao tantara
It may never come.	mety tsy ho tonga mihitsy izany
It's in good shape.	ao tsara izy io
But it turns out the world really does.	saingy hita fa tena manao izany izao tontolo izao
Yes, that’s a good thing.	eny zavatra tsara izany
We speak the truth.	manao teny marina izahay
I have other problems as well.	manana olana hafa koa aho
Today, no one sees him here.	aminizao andro izao dia tsy misy mahita azy eto
It doesn’t need a lot, a little goes a long way.	tsy mila zavatra be izany ny kely dia lasa lavitra
He really did.	tena nanao izany izy
But you can’t be both.	saingy tsy afaka ny ho izy roa ianao
It was a long way from home.	tena trano lavitra be ilay izy
It's nice to be here.	mahafinaritra ny tonga eto
At first he didn’t know what it was.	taminny voalohany dia tsy fantany hoe inona izany
The first for both.	ny voalohany ho azy roa
We are happy.	faly izahay
You know, maybe not.	fantatrao angamba tsy izany
Not much, as it turns out.	tsy dia betsaka araka ny hita
All women should be as normal.	ny vehivavy rehetra dia tokony ho toy ny mahazatra
It didn’t make sense to me.	tsy nisy dikany tamiko izany
Gone and gone.	lasa ary lasa
But I have a problem.	manana olana anefa aho
It can also be a good game.	mety ho lalao tsara koa izany
They haven't seen you yet.	tsy mbola nahita anao izy ireo
But this is also uncertain.	tsy azo antoka koa anefa izany
So don’t expect any more.	koa aza manantena intsony
But not for everyone.	saingy tsy ho anny rehetra
This is life .	izao no fiainana
However, they don’t get it.	na izany aza tsy mahazo izy ireo
That’s where the trouble started.	teo no nanomboka ny olana
He seems confused.	toa very hevitra izy
It was in the news.	tany aminny vaovao izany
As for me, it’s simply full.	raha ny ahy dia feno tsotra izao
Yes, it is difficult.	eny sarotra izany
The results were great.	nahafinaritra ny vokatra
It has to be okay.	tsy maintsy mety
That was good then.	tsara izany taminizany
Anyway, I go.	na izany aza mandeha aho
I am a woman now.	vehivavy aho izao
There is nothing.	tsy misy na inona na inona
This thing is bad.	ratsy ity zavatra ity
You can earn money without it.	azonao atao ny mahazo ny vola tsy misy
These are really fun times.	tena mahafinaritra tokoa ireo fotoana ireo
Sometimes life can be hard.	indraindray dia mety ho sarotra ny fiainana
Simple people like you and me.	olona tsotra toa ahy sy ianao
Good on everything.	tsara aminny zavadrehetra
Enough time, then.	ampy ny fotoana ary
Whether they walk or not.	na mandeha na tsy mandeha izy ireo
I don’t want to do that.	tsy te hanao izany aho
No one came.	tsy nisy olona tonga
This is almost true.	saika marina izany
He didn’t think about work.	tsy nieritreritra momba ny asa izy
Everything had to be done.	tsy maintsy natao ny zavadrehetra
That’s too good to be true, they said.	tena tsara loatra izany hoy izy ireo
The surroundings will be better.	ho tsara kokoa ny manodidina
It’s clear you’re not even watching the game.	mazava tsara fa tsy mijery ny lalao akory ianao
Both the house and the land are very large.	na ny trano sy ny tany dia tena lehibe
All of them.	izy rehetra
And it can do it all the way for you.	ary afaka manao ny lalana rehetra ho anao
I think it’s going to become pointless.	heveriko fa ho lasa tsy misy dikany izany
It’s not real.	tsy tena izy io
The fact is they are exactly the same.	ny zavamisy dia mitovy tanteraka izy ireo
We have already done work there.	efa nanao asa izahay tany
It’s all too much.	be loatra izany rehetra izany
It wasn't very fun.	tsy dia nahafinaritra loatra ilay izy
The man stopped.	nijanona ilay lehilahy
We are one now.	iray isika izao
Very simple.	tena tsotra
We need to always follow it.	mila manaraka izany foana isika
These are problems.	olana ireo
I even thought he might be dead.	nieritreritra mihitsy aza aho hoe mety efa maty izy
Make it fun for them.	ataovy mahafinaritra ho azy ireo izany
You know you did something.	fantatrao fa nanao zavatra ianao
Not a bad place.	tsy toerana ratsy
Yes, he is good.	eny tsara izy
Sounds crazy.	toa adala
People need you.	mila anao ny olona
All three are very good.	tena tsara izy telo
But that doesn’t make sense right now.	saingy tsy misy dikany izany aminizao fotoana izao
It doesn’t seem to be real yet.	toa mbola tsy tena izy izany
So it is for us.	dia ho antsika koa izany
Today, it is the most common and cheapest food.	aminizao fotoana izao dia sakafo mahazatra sy mora indrindra izy io
This is very true.	tena marina izany
I think they are probably right.	heveriko fa marina angamba izy ireo
No more than any other man.	tsy mihoatra noho ny lehilahy hafa
You know, for the future.	fantatrao ho anny ho avy
It all went well.	nandeha tsara daholo izany
You know the problem.	fantatrao ny olana
I will be happy.	ho faly aho
He’s a real thing.	tena zavatra izy
The idea, then, is very simple.	ny hevitra toy izany dia tena tsotra
And that he is not alone.	ary hoe tsy irery izy
It was fun.	nahafinaritra ilay izy
They are always different but the same.	samy hafa foana izy ireo fa mitovy
You can too.	mety koa ianao
Here we are again.	eto indray isika izao
The earth does the same.	manao toy izany koa ny tany
It's far away.	lavitra io
And that’s good.	ary tsara izany
You have the facts.	manana ny zavamisy ianao
When they are young, it is difficult.	mbola kely izy ireo dia sarotra izany
It really doesn’t make sense.	tena tsy misy dikany izany
Two people who have nothing to lose.	olona roa tsy manana na inona na inona ho very
That’s all good.	tsara daholo izany
But, in fact, it’s not like that often.	saingy raha ny marina tsy toy izany izy matetika
Not too stupid of either.	tsy adala loatra aminizy roa
But he could never do that.	tsy afaka nanao izany mihitsy anefa izy
They both do beautiful things.	samy manao zavatra tsara tarehy
Very important.	tena zavadehibe
This method is very good.	ity fomba ity dia tena tsara
It’s all just work.	asa fotsiny izany rehetra izany
I have this.	manana ity aho
It seems like hard work.	toa asa mafy izany
I think he has an idea.	heveriko fa manana hevitra izy
We are not things.	tsy zavatra isika
But I didn’t like to see it.	tsy tiako anefa ny nahita izany
We used to go there.	nandeha tany izahay taloha
Which, apparently, is not possible.	izay hita fa tsy azo atao
But at the time, it was a good fight.	saingy taminizany fotoana izany dia ady tsara izany
It becomes completely meaningless.	lasa tsy misy dikany tanteraka izany
But you can't.	tsy afaka anefa ianao
Everyone stopped and looked down.	nijanona ny rehetra ary nijery ambany
That could all be true.	mety ho marina daholo izany
There were only a few.	somary kely fotsiny no nisy
He has never done that.	tsy mbola nanao izany izy
It works the same way.	miasa toy izany koa
In fact, it will become commonplace.	raha ny marina dia ho lasa mahazatra izany
He’s not great for me.	tsia lehibe ho ahy izy
It needs no reason.	tsy mila antony izany
What works for me may not work for you.	izay mety amiko dia mety tsy mety aminao
That is a real question.	fanontaniana marina io
So it’s done here.	noho izany dia natao izany eto
One can expect.	afaka manantena ny iray
He is the greatest.	izy no lehibe indrindra
Whatever the problem.	na inona na inona olana
Cheap money, he told himself.	vola mora hoy izy taminny tenany
Yes, we did.	eny nanao izany izahay
It would not have happened.	tsy ho nisy izany
As usual, he never seemed to know.	toy ny mahazatra dia toa tsy fantany mihitsy
That is true.	marina izany
And it is.	ary izy io
This is no longer a pleasant place.	tsy toerana mahafinaritra intsony izao
Because it was more fun.	satria nahafinaritra kokoa izany
All very small, and needless.	rehetra tena kely ary mila
Or he to her, he said.	na izy taminy hoy izy
In fact, it will still be fulfilled.	raha ny marina dia mbola ho tanteraka izany
I didn't have a job.	tsy nanana asa aho
It’s fun.	mahafinaritra izany
And that's true.	ary marina izany
But I went inside.	nandeha tao anatiny anefa aho
But he must be wrong.	tsy maintsy diso anefa izy
However, it seems to be about to happen.	na izany aza dia toa efa ho tanteraka izany
That's all there is to it.	izay ihany ny resaka
It’s not easy, it’s hard for them.	tsy mora izany sarotra ho azy ireo

Now you need these things.	ankehitriny dia mila ireo zavatra ireo ianao
It didn't go well.	tsy nandeha tsara ilay izy
In spite of everything.	na eo aza ny zavadrehetra
It didn’t make sense.	tsy nisy dikany izany
It has to work in two ways.	tsy maintsy miasa aminny fomba roa izany
The bigger the better.	ny lehibe kokoa dia tsara kokoa
Of course they have.	mazava ho azy fa manana izy ireo
They were not there.	tsy tao izy ireo
This is not a guarantee.	tsy antoka izany
Everything was fun.	nahafinaritra ny zavadrehetra
But someone was missing.	nisy olona tsy hita anefa
This is a wrong idea.	hevitra diso izany
Which is not necessary.	izay tsy ilaina
It’s just money.	vola fotsiny izany
The kind of person I love the most.	karazana olona tiako indrindra
That’s a lot.	be dia be izany
Whatever you want.	izay rehetra tianao
It’s something else.	zavatra hafa aminizany izany
If anything else.	raha nisy zavatra hafa
Many others have done so.	olona maro hafa no nanao izany
We saw him once.	indray mandeha izahay no nahita azy
And that's all there is.	dia izay ihany no misy
The first did so.	ny voalohany dia nanao izany
They’ve had it before and it doesn’t work.	efa nanana izany izy ireo taloha ary tsy mandeha
Adala be.	adala be
We will make the game.	hanao ny lalao izahay
Maybe he didn’t see her.	angamba tsy nahita azy izy
I don't want to be for you.	tsy tiako ny ho anao
He was often alone.	matetika izy irery no tao
They really do.	tena manao izany izy ireo
There just isn’t enough space.	tsy ampy fotsiny ny toerana

It was all fun.	nahafinaritra ny rehetra
It’s a little lower than ours.	somary ambany noho ny antsika izany
Yes, there are things you can do.	eny misy zavatra azonao atao
But that's just crazy.	adala fotsiny anefa izany
No he said, everything is fine.	tsia hoy izy tsara ny zavadrehetra
Only two are like that here.	roa ihany no toy izany eto
But that seems important to me.	toa zavadehibe amiko anefa izany
Maybe it’s too hard.	sarotra loatra angamba izany
There is no right or wrong way.	tsy misy fomba tsara na tsy mety
But if you like.	fa raha tianao
She said she was more beautiful than before.	nilaza izy fa tsara tarehy kokoa noho ny taloha izy
This was the biggest problem for me.	io no olana lehibe tamiko
But not you.	fa tsy ianao
Life loves me.	ny fiainana dia tia ahy
I really need it.	tena mila izany aho
No, it's not like that.	tsia tsy toy izany

It’s in all the time.	ao aminny fotoana rehetra izany
Because they can.	noho izy ireo afaka
You are the only one there.	ianao ihany no misy

The question of this, however, can be problematic.	ny fanontaniana momba izany anefa dia mety ho olana
They are there.	ao izy ireo
It will be a simple process.	ho fomba tsotra izany
On this special day, however, it is there.	aminity andro manokana ity anefa dia misy izany
Some are right, others are not.	ny sasany mety ny hafa tsy
This is not true of all images.	tsy marina izany taminny sary rehetra
I hope they do.	manantena aho fa manao izany izy ireo
I think that's true.	heveriko fa marina izany
That is the biggest problem.	izay no olana lehibe indrindra
Yes, not a problem.	eny tsy olana
But that’s one thing.	saingy zavatra iray izany
We must do the same.	tsy maintsy manao toy izany koa isika
But sometimes there are no right words.	saingy indraindray dia tsy misy teny mety
I'm good too.	tsara koa aho
Designed for.	natao ho anny
A lot like me that year.	betsaka ny toa ahy taminizany taona izany
There is no other place like it.	tsy misy toerana hafa toa azy
I hope he is too.	manantena aho fa izy koa
You get the best of both worlds.	mahazo ny tsara indrindra aminny tontolo roa ianao
And that, and that.	ary izany ary izany
Yes, you are mine now.	eny ahy ianao izao
I looked.	nijery aho
This is a house.	trano ity
It seemed fun.	toa nahafinaritra azy io
He is gone.	efa lasa izy
You don’t want to be seen anymore.	tsy te ho hita intsony ianao
It was all still there.	mbola teo daholo izany rehetra izany
You have never seen a more handsome man.	tsy nahita lehilahy tsara tarehy kokoa ianao
But it’s not that simple.	saingy tsy dia tsotra izany
It’s basically a men’s thing.	aminny ankapobeny dia zavatra lehilahy
He never existed.	tsy nisy mihitsy izy
I haven’t watched them both yet.	mbola tsy nijery azy roa aho
It’s not the same.	tsy mitovy izany
That's really good.	tena tsara izany
Good product all around.	vokatra tsara manodidina
So nothing can be done.	noho izany dia tsy misy na inona na inona azo atao
He had to stay a long time.	tsy maintsy nijanona ela be izy
But not everyone is so sure.	saingy tsy ny rehetra no tena azo antoka
Just look.	jereo fotsiny
I could be wrong.	mety ho diso aho
So it came to pass.	ka dia tonga izany
It all seems to be true.	toa marina daholo izany
This is a great product.	vokatra lehibe tokoa izany
The easy, automatic.	ny mora mandeha ho azy
But you came.	fa tonga ianao
So, we are not bad.	noho izany tsy ratsy izahay
You get the best job.	mahazo ny asa tsara indrindra ianao

He looked at me confused.	very hevitra izy nijery ahy
It's too big.	lehibe loatra ilay izy
It took us a while to arrive.	nila fotoana kely izahay vao tonga
Everyone has a past, present and future.	samy manana ny lasa sy ny ankehitriny ary ny ho avy ny tsirairay
And it’s just a word to them.	ary teny fotsiny ho azy ireo izany

Life is very small for him.	tena kely ny fiainana ho azy
He needed money.	nila vola izy
That’s exactly it.	izany indrindra
Not with everyone watching.	tsy miaraka aminny rehetra mijery
Then they have no work.	avy eo dia tsy misy asa izy ireo
But because he saw no other option.	saingy noho izy tsy nahita safidy hafa
Fun way.	fomba mahafinaritra
And then he was everywhere.	ary avy eo dia teny rehetra teny izy
Just don’t get lost.	aza very fotsiny
He is not allowed to do that.	tsy mahazo manao izany izy

It is necessary to be honest.	ilaina ny manao ny marina
He didn't need it.	tsy nila izany izy

Because he really loved himself.	satria tena tia ny tenany izy

You are doing well.	manao tsara ianao
We are not that stupid.	tsy adala toy izany izahay
I am not such a person.	tsy olona toy izany aho
He can't go very far now.	tsy afaka lavitra be izy izao

It all makes no sense.	tsy misy dikany daholo izany
The surroundings are small.	kely ny manodidina
Which is not.	izay tsy
They are all women.	vehivavy daholo
We now have enough money for the trip.	manana vola ampy ho anny dia izahay izao
But for some reason he does.	saingy noho ny antony sasany dia manao izany izy

I can't die.	tsy mety maty aho
Not so either.	tsy izany koa
And people keep coming.	ary tonga hatrany ny olona
They had none.	tsy nanana izy ireo

He should have looked earlier.	tokony ho nijery teo aloha izy
Everything is stupid.	adala daholo ny zavadrehetra
Great woman.	vehivavy lehibe
That seemed like bad news to him.	toa vaovao ratsy taminy izany
Kind of .	toa karazana
There is no individual picture.	tsy misy sary tsirairay
And it’s very difficult.	ary sarotra be izany
Nothing like this had ever happened to him.	mbola tsy nisy toy izany taminy mihitsy

You almost died.	saika maty ianao
Everything else is as it should be.	ny zavatra hafa rehetra dia araka ny tokony ho izy
But no one saw him there.	tsy nisy nahita azy tao anefa
And we did.	ary nanao izany izahay
So, the option seems to be the best option.	noho izany ny safidy dia toa ny safidy tsara indrindra
However, if wrong.	na izany aza raha diso
The same is true of others.	toy izany koa ny hafa
You want her to be happy.	tianao ho faly izy
He said it had happened before.	nilaza izy fa efa nisy izany taloha
He loves me first.	tia ahy aloha izy
That’s the biggest part.	izany no ampahany lehibe indrindra
There is a little bit of everything.	misy kely ny zavatra rehetra
He looked at me again.	nijery ahy indray izy
It got a good idea.	nahazo hevitra tsara izy io
But this is not the end.	tsy mbola izao anefa no farany
But of course not.	saingy mazava ho azy fa tsy izany
That’s exactly what he likes.	izay indrindra no tiany
You don’t have to do anything else.	tsy mila manao zavatra hafa ianao
Then it becomes something else.	avy eo dia lasa zavatra hafa
Clearly it is not working.	mazava fa tsy mandeha io
It’s really hard.	tena sarotra izany

A house, but it doesn’t make sense.	trano iray saingy tsy misy dikany izany

Then it is you.	dia ianao izany
The news is still coming.	mbola tonga ny vaovao
I'll come if you need anything.	ho avy aho raha mila zavatra ianao
If he could have said it the hard way, he did.	raha afaka nilaza izany taminny fomba sarotra izy dia nanao izany
It’s just one thing.	zavatra iray fotsiny izany
But it’s not too bad.	saingy tsy dia ratsy loatra izany
I have bad news.	manana vaovao ratsy aho
The surroundings are good.	tsara ny manodidina
But there was simply no safe way.	saingy tsy nisy fomba azo antoka fotsiny
And they do things like war.	ary manao zavatra toa ady izy ireo
You have money.	manana vola ianao
There was just nothing.	tsy nisy ihany
I saw you driving.	hitako nandeha fiara ianao
He got it.	nahazo izany izy
Basically it is.	aminny ankapobeny dia izany
I work hard.	miasa mafy aho
And they are no better.	ary tsy tsara kokoa izy ireo

I am with him.	miaraka aminy aho
They are also very easy.	tena mora koa izy ireo
They made way for someone.	nanao lalana ho anny olona iray izy ireo
But it’s worth it.	saingy mendrika izany
This is not a place.	tsy toerana izany
Indeed, it is not.	eny tokoa tsy izany
This can generally be done in two ways.	aminny ankapobeny dia azo atao aminny fomba roa izany
Too fast.	haingana loatra
Everything else seems good.	toa tsara daholo ny zavatra hafa rehetra
I’m with him on that too.	miaraka aminy aminizany koa aho
So each story is fun.	ka ny tantara tsirairay dia mahafinaritra
You can disagree.	afaka tsy mitovy hevitra ianao
You will do it.	ianao no hanao izany
And don’t get me wrong.	ary aza diso hevitra aho

But it was difficult to do things.	sarotra anefa ny nanao zavatra
There are other issues as well.	misy olana hafa koa
Sometimes, this can be difficult.	indraindray mety ho sarotra izany

They should be here at all times.	tokony ho eto izy ireo aminny fotoana rehetra
The part is true.	marina ny ampahany
It is the past.	ny lasa no izy
This is a bad practice.	fomba ratsy izany
Sometimes I go too far.	lasa lavitra aho indraindray
We’re the only ones who don’t come up with all the stories.	isika ihany no tsy tonga miaraka aminny tantara rehetra
He said he loved her.	nilaza izy fa tia azy
There is nothing wrong.	tsy misy diso
Many people don’t look at it that way.	maro ny olona tsy mijery izany aminizany fomba izany
This is a very good choice.	safidy tena tsara izany

None of these seem real to me yet.	mbola tsy misy aminireo toa tena misy amiko
They can and have existed.	afaka ary efa nisy izy ireo
We have to be very clear about that.	tsy maintsy mazava tsara isika momba izany
Easy at first.	mora aminny voalohany
You really are.	tena izany ianao

But, of course, it won’t.	saingy mazava ho azy tsy ho izy
Then he looked down.	dia nijery ambany izy
We have to do something really hard, you know.	tsy maintsy manao zavatra tena sarotra isika fantatrao
I need to do something.	mila manao zavatra aho
However, this particular issue is not clear.	na izany aza ity olana manokana ity dia tsy mazava
And one and another and another.	ary iray sy iray hafa ary iray hafa
Not that he hadn’t seen it coming.	tsy hoe tsy mbola nahita izany ho avy izy
It’s something else.	zavatra hafa izany
Otherwise, there was one.	raha tsy izany dia nisy iray
No problem, they said.	tsy misy olana hoy izy ireo
There are others, of course.	misy hafa mazava ho azy

He was wrong.	diso hevitra izy
It is not a matter of choice.	tsy resaka safidy izany
And he loves that way.	ary tiany izany fomba izany
There are a lot of shortcomings in this game.	be dia be ny tsy ampy aminity lalao ity
No, there is nothing up there.	tsia tsy misy na inona na inona any ambony any
They do things.	manao zavatra izy ireo
The then and then.	ny avy eo sy eo
Nothing is found here.	tsy misy na inona na inona hita eto
They all die at once.	maty daholo indray mandeha
But the process is not automatic.	saingy tsy mandeha ho azy ny dingana
You won’t know it if you look at them.	tsy ho fantatrao izany raha mijery azy ireo ianao
Not many people do that.	tsy maro ny olona manao izany
To make everything easy.	mba ho mora ny zavatra rehetra
I thought a lot about it.	nieritreritra be aho momba izany
Make it great.	ataovy lehibe

It may not be easy.	mety tsy ho mora izany

We had these questions too.	nanana ireo fanontaniana ireo koa izahay
Don’t do anything out of the ordinary.	aza manao zavatra tsy mahazatra

Maybe you just need someone to do it for you.	angamba mila olona hanao izany ho anao fotsiny ianao
Had a hard time.	nanana mafy
We all just love him.	tia azy fotsiny izahay rehetra
There is nothing more fun.	tsy misy zavatra mahafinaritra kokoa
There is another, more obvious reason.	misy antony iray hafa mazava kokoa
Both the process and the outcome are important.	samy zavadehibe ny dingana sy ny vokatra
Not just about me personally.	tsy ny momba ahy manokana ihany
I got a lot of news.	nahazo vaovao be aho
We can start again, somewhere else.	afaka manomboka indray isika any aminny toerana hafa
It is bad to see him die.	ratsy ny mahita azy maty
We are happy for that too.	faly koa izahay noho izany
And no one sees it.	ary tsy misy mahita izany
But that is not enough.	tsy ampy anefa izany
These steps are designed for everyone.	ireo dingana ireo dia natao ho anny tsirairay
Disliked ideas.	hevitra tsy tia
It’s not that the facts are wrong.	tsy hoe tsy mety ny zavamisy
He said many things to me.	nilaza zavatra maro tamiko izy
But something.	fa zavatra
I thought no.	nieritreritra aho hoe tsia
Anyway, good idea.	na izany na tsy izany hevitra tsara
There is no one like me.	tsy misy toa ahy
It’s all around you.	manodidina anao izany
But now, when you arrive, it’s gone.	saingy aminizao fotoana izao rehefa tonga ianao dia tsy misy izany
I don't know.	tsy fantatro
It’s really hard to do well.	tena sarotra ny manao tsara
This may not be right at times.	mety tsy mety izany indraindray
Of course there will be.	mazava ho azy fa hisy
Do it once.	ataovy indray mandeha
Unless they didn’t.	raha tsy hoe tsy nanao izany izy ireo
Not a place, or something.	tsy toerana na zavatra
We were all very happy.	faly be izahay rehetra
He follows me around.	manaraka ahy manodidina izy
You too.	ianao koa
Yes, of course it is not possible.	eny mazava ho azy fa tsy azo atao
That's what it is.	izany no misy
Sometimes they are close.	indraindray izy ireo dia akaiky
He was well done.	natao tsara izy
People could have traveled farther because of better roads.	afaka nandeha lavitra kokoa ny olona noho ny lalana tsara kokoa
Not everything is as it should be.	tsy araka ny tokony ho izy ny zavadrehetra
It is always now.	dia izao na izao foana
I think that’s very close.	heveriko fa tena akaiky tokoa izany
Once upon a time it was very late at night.	indray mandeha dia tena efa alina be
But in fact.	saingy raha ny marina
First, clear facts, things you already know.	voalohany zavamisy mazava zavatra efa fantatrao
I am new to my place.	vaovao aminny toerana misy ahy aho
No one saw it coming.	tsy nisy nahita izany ho avy
But not all of them.	tsy izy rehetra anefa
To me it’s not a job.	amiko tsy asa io
They go fast.	mandeha haingana izy ireo
This comes from two facts.	izany dia avy aminny zavamisy roa
Now, you have it again this time.	ankehitriny manana izany indray ianao aminity fotoana ity
Yes, she loves this man.	eny tiany io lehilahy io
I have not seen anything better.	tsy nahita zavatra tsara kokoa aho
Better than before.	tsara noho ny taloha
However, it is not very simple.	na izany aza tsy dia tena tsotra izany
In the old days he had it.	taminny andro taloha dia nanana izany izy
I hope people disagree.	manantena aho fa tsy mitovy hevitra ny olona
Now there are many like him.	ankehitriny dia maro ny toa azy
It makes sense.	misy dikany izany
It's the same with them.	toy izany koa ny aminizy ireo
Everything comes from nothing.	ny zavadrehetra dia avy aminny tsy misy
Now he knows.	ankehitriny dia fantany
It should be very simple.	tokony ho tena tsotra
You know the world is small.	fantatrao fa kely izao tontolo izao
You get nothing else from me.	tsy mahazo zavatra hafa amiko ianao
I like it because it’s different.	tiako satria hafa ilay izy
And they were not fools.	ary tsy nisy adala izy ireo
He just is.	fotsiny izy
People here are different.	hafa ny olona eto
I'm crazy.	adala aho
The war is going on.	mandeha ny ady
It was him.	izy ilay izy
I don't know that.	tsy fantatro izany
Maybe you won’t.	angamba tsy hanao izany ianao
I need to work here.	mila miasa eto aho
But there is something else.	saingy misy zavatra hafa
I have better news for you.	manana vaovao tsara kokoa ho anao aho
He should do it.	tokony hanao izany izy
The car was running properly.	nandeha araka ny tokony ho izy ny fiara
I really like this story.	tena tiako ity tantara ity
We didn’t stay long.	tsy nijanona ela izahay
It was like three at once.	toy ny telo indray mandeha izany
They are the only two now.	izy roa ihany izao
That is always the problem.	izany foana no olana
Exactly the same picture.	sary mitovy tanteraka
What could be wrong !.	inona no mety ho diso
There are many others.	betsaka ny hafa
Still, it was fun.	na izany aza dia nahafinaritra
But they are very similar.	tena mitovy anefa izy ireo
And it really doesn’t make sense.	ary tena tsy misy dikany
But she is beautiful.	fa tsara tarehy izy
But he knew the time had come.	fantany anefa fa tonga ny fotoana
Yes, car.	eny fiara
No, he had no words.	tsia tsy nisy teny tiany
But not on the main road.	tsy aminny lalana lehibe anefa
It should be quick and easy to go.	tokony ho haingana sy mora ny mandeha izany
It’s nothing.	tsy misy na inona na inona izany
There are also people who will do it.	misy ihany koa ny olona hanao izany
Yes, a long time ago.	eny efa ela izay
It was really good.	tena tsara ilay izy
So it had to be.	ka tsy maintsy nisy izany
Many people died.	betsaka ny olona maty
No one did it first.	tsy nisy nanao azy voalohany
I would never do that.	tsy hanao izany mihitsy aho
So, if you don’t like the job, fine.	noho izany raha tsy tianao ny asa tsara
I never wanted to be one.	tsy te ho lasa iray mihitsy aho
You go all night, you need it.	mandeha aminny alina feno ianao mila izany ianao
Eventually we all died.	rehefa ela ny ela dia maty daholo isika rehetra
But again, all of this is pointless.	saingy indray izany rehetra izany dia tsy misy dikany
If not, if not, if not.	raha tsy raha tsy raha tsy
But it is clear to me now.	fa mazava amiko izao
I don't work.	tsy miasa aho
It came to me.	tonga tamiko izany
There were no games either.	tsy nisy koa ny lalao
Real words.	teny tena izy
They are my favorite.	izy ireo no tiako indrindra
We are not like that.	tsy mba toy izany isika
The old world was important to him.	zavadehibe taminy ny tontolo taloha
There are two steps to this.	misy dingana roa izany
There was no work.	tsy nisy asa
And partially wrong as well.	ary diso ampahany ihany koa
But look here, this one below.	fa jereo eto ity any ambany ity
I didn't do anything else.	tsy nanao zavatra hafa aho
A house is a house.	ny trano dia trano iray
There is a lot of work there.	betsaka ny asa any
Okay, he said.	mety hoy izy
That could be a big deal for him, well.	mety ho zavatra be ho azy izany tsara
not much.	tsy betsaka
I think some of them.	heveriko fa ny sasany aminizy ireo
Do it.	ataovy izany
He is too small.	kely loatra izy
No one did anything important about it.	tsy nisy olona nanao zavadehibe taminizany
I know now.	fantatro izao
She looked more beautiful as the days went by.	toa tsara tarehy kokoa izy rehefa nandeha ny andro
And they needed me.	ary nila ahy izy ireo
Too close to me.	akaiky loatra amiko
In fact, the idea had just come to him.	vao tonga tao aminy ilay hevitra raha ny marina
People just want to be here.	te ho eto fotsiny ny olona
That is not the problem.	tsy izany no olana
Still very good.	mbola tsara tsara
Although this is true.	na dia marina aza izany
The fact is, it never seems to be enough.	ny zavamisy dia toa tsy ampy mihitsy izany
It was not hard to find him.	tsy sarotra ny nahita azy
A little game, of course.	lalao kely mazava ho azy
But it still doesn’t work.	saingy mbola tsy mandeha izany
Not very fun.	tsy dia mahafinaritra
Not all together.	tsy miaraka daholo
That guy doesn’t.	tsy manao izany lehilahy izany
If anything.	raha nisy aza izany
He seemed happy.	toa faly izy
But there is something about this man.	saingy misy zavatra momba anio lehilahy io
And this one is doing fast.	ary ity iray ity dia manao haingana
I would probably do something wrong.	mety hanao zavatra tsy mety mihitsy aho
In fact, the world is not difficult.	raha ny marina izao tontolo izao dia tsy sarotra
I really need to go.	tena mila mandeha aho
But they found nothing.	tsy nahita na inona na inona anefa izy ireo
I hope that's okay.	manantena aho fa mety izany
He seemed very happy.	toa faly be izy
It’s so beautiful.	tena tsara tarehy izany
It could have been better.	mety ho tsara kokoa izany
The road is the problem.	ny lalana no olana
It was easy then.	mora izany taminizany
There may be a reason.	mety misy antony
But it is.	fa izy io
It must be too soon.	tsy maintsy ho vao haingana loatra izany
This is important.	zavadehibe izany
He may not come.	mety tsy ho avy izy
But it is work.	asa anefa izany
And everyone loves us for that.	ary tia antsika ny rehetra noho izany
Everything is wrong.	diso daholo ny rehetra
You have an idea there.	misy hevitra ianao ao
I can do things.	afaka manao zavatra aho
I saw him.	hitako izy
He really doesn’t.	tena tsy manao izany izy
This one is very simple, but of course not easy.	ity iray ity dia tena tsotra saingy mazava ho azy fa tsy mora
It's time.	fotoana izao
Not that there will be one.	tsy hoe hisy iray akory
He hasn't looked at me yet.	mbola tsy nijery ahy izy
They are good people.	olona tsara izy ireo
We haven’t been there yet.	tsy mbola nisy izahay
But you are also one.	fa iray ihany koa ianao
There should be more people here.	tokony ho betsaka kokoa ny olona eto
No, he is tough.	tsia mafy izy
But it was good for me.	tsara tamiko anefa izany
We can get a place for that.	afaka mahazo toerana aminizany isika
Works well.	miasa tsara
They are the only good ones.	izy ireo ihany no tsara
It really happened.	tena nisy izany
Normally it always is.	raha ny mahazatra dia foana
Or maybe not.	na mety tsy
But that is not for you.	tsy anao anefa izany
This one is easier.	ity iray ity dia mora kokoa
I soon knew why.	tsy ela dia fantatro ny antony
Lots of money.	be dia be ny vola
And it could be faster than that.	ary mety ho haingana kokoa noho izany
Things are different now.	hafa ny zavatra ankehitriny
You know what day it is.	fantatrao hoe andro inona izany
However, you should do the latter.	na izany aza dia tokony hanao ny farany
We are crazy.	adala izahay
This is not a war.	tsy ady izany
Maybe someone was there.	angamba nisy olona teo
The end has begun.	nanomboka ny farany
Even too early.	na aloha be aza
It is important to do so.	zavadehibe ny nanao izany
So you can find what works best for you.	noho izany dia afaka mahita izay mety aminao indrindra ianao
About three of them came.	tokony ho telo teo ho eo izy ireo no tonga
They are women.	vehivavy izy ireo
He went too far.	lasa lavitra loatra izy
Not hard, just a little.	tsy sarotra kely fotsiny
However, the process stopped.	na izany aza nijanona ny dingana
We have had enough.	ampy izahay
But there is no full picture.	saingy tsy misy sary feno
He knew he had to tell the truth.	fantany fa tsy maintsy nilaza ny marina izy
It will make a better world for you.	hanao tontolo tsara ho anao izany
It’s always been like that.	toy izany foana
For another, he is not stupid.	ho anny iray hafa dia tsy adala izy
You did no wrong.	tsy nanao ratsy ianao
But it comes from.	fa izany dia avy aminny
They shouldn’t have gotten there.	tsy tokony ho tonga any izy ireo
Everyone loves us.	tia anay ny rehetra
Overall the best match for him.	aminny ankapobeny ny lalao tsara indrindra aminy
It was a bad year.	taona ratsy izany
The past is gone.	ny lasa dia efa lasa
He didn't go very far.	tsy lasa lavitra intsony izy
It didn't seem to matter to him.	tsy hoe toa zavadehibe taminy izany
It’s not the same everywhere around.	tsy mitovy aminny toerana rehetra manodidina
What could be simpler ?.	inona no mety ho tsotra kokoa
If only we could all.	raha mba afaka isika rehetra
All these cars.	ireo fiara rehetra ireo
I will be there first.	ho eo aloha aho
But it will be easier.	ho mora kokoa anefa izany
Just a lot.	be dia be ihany
The time has come.	tonga ny fotoana
You are the only one here.	ianao irery no eto
Yes, he was everywhere.	eny teny rehetra teny izy
He did nothing alone.	tsy nanao na inona na inona irery izy
The years go by fast.	mandeha haingana ny taona
He hasn't come yet.	mbola tsy tonga izy
Thanks for watching.	misaotra nijery
The man is crazy.	adala ilay lehilahy
Or men.	na lehilahy
We already had a history.	efa nanana tantara izahay
It’s really not that hard.	tena tsy sarotra be izany
But you don’t have to do it without it.	saingy tsy mila manao izany ianao raha tsy misy izany
I hope you like them.	manantena aho fa ho tianao izy ireo
Something different.	zavatra tsy mitovy hevitra
I go farther.	mandeha lavitra kokoa aho
But not all of them.	saingy tsy izy rehetra ireo
These are men.	lehilahy ireo
Apparently they are both.	toa izy roa ireo
He didn't love her either.	tsy tia azy koa izy
It’s still meaningless and meaningless.	mbola tsy misy dikany sy tsy misy dikany
The problem is it’s been around for too long.	ny olana dia efa ela loatra ilay izy
What is uncertain.	inona no tsy azo antoka
He was fun.	nahafinaritra izy
One day you will need it too.	indray andro dia mila izany koa ianao
Now he could finally think.	ankehitriny dia afaka nieritreritra izy taminny farany
And not just a little lost.	ary tsy very kely fotsiny
It’s a real job.	asa marina izany
Probably not necessary.	angamba tsy ilaina
So we don’t always have to do that.	ka tsy mila manao izany foana isika
He is better now.	tsara kokoa izy izao
I then had a choice.	nanana safidy aho avy eo
I see these people.	hitako ireo olona ireo
Had to.	nanana ho
What you always want.	izay tianao foana
I used to be a very special person.	tena olona manokana aho taloha
They both seemed to have a good time.	toa samy nanana fotoana tsara izy ireo
He didn't tell me that.	tsy nilaza izany tamiko izy
See below.	jereo eto ambany
I love him and everyone, but from afar.	tiako izy sy ny rehetra fa avy lavitra
You are always there.	misy foana ianao
The right way for me.	ny fomba mety ho ahy
It's simple.	tsotra izany
But there is a problem with this approach.	misy olana anefa io fomba io
People go to work.	mandeha miasa ny olona
At one point, it was very difficult for me.	indray mandeha dia tena sarotra tamiko izany
I know it’s a process.	fantatro fa dingana izany
Probably the.	angamba ny
I enjoy it.	mahafinaritra ahy izany
Maybe not for me, but for you.	angamba tsy ho ahy fa ho anao
But he was lost without me.	very anefa izy tsy nisy ahy
The results are the same for both jobs.	mitovy ny vokatra ho anny asa roa
Nothing else can be done.	tsy misy zavatra hafa azo atao
Otherwise, they went.	raha tsy izany dia nandeha izy ireo
I didn't even look at them.	tsy nijery azy ireo akory aho
This is a new movement.	ity dia hetsika vaovao
There were many stories about them.	nisy tantara maro momba azy ireo
Yes, it is not.	eny tsy izany
He needed it, he thought.	nila izany izy hoy izy nieritreritra
They are different things.	zavatra samy hafa izy ireo
He kind of saw her.	somary nahita azy ihany izy
I really am not.	tena tsy izany aho
Such a great place.	toerana lehibe toy izany
I don’t know what will be the problem with that.	tsy fantatro izay ho olana aminizany
They will still love him.	mbola ho tia azy izy ireo
Especially the stupid stuff.	indrindra ny zavatra adala
Just like you.	toy ny anao
But he couldn't do it.	saingy tsy afaka nanao izany izy
However, of course, this is not the case.	na izany aza mazava ho azy fa tsy izany no izy
We do seem to see similar results.	toa mahita vokatra toy izany tokoa isika
Of course, he knew everything right away.	mazava ho azy fa fantany avy hatrany ny zavadrehetra
It all comes down to that.	izany rehetra izany no tonga aminizany
Even less than last year.	na dia kely kokoa aza taminny taona lasa
You know it now.	fantatrao izao izany
I'm so much better.	tena tsara kokoa aho
You can even do them.	azonao atao mihitsy aza ny manao azy ireo
They got something.	nahazo zavatra izy ireo
He went crazy.	lasa adala izy
It has to be.	tsy maintsy ho
About the old days.	momba ny andro taloha
In all worlds.	aminny tontolo rehetra
See if it is true or not.	jereo na marina na tsia
In fact, it is.	raha ny tena izy dia izay
We will do it.	hanao izany izahay
And it can be beautiful.	ary mety ho tsara tarehy
Not just in games but in everything.	tsy aminny lalao ihany fa aminny zavadrehetra
Men never like her.	tsy tia azy mihitsy ny lehilahy
Both thought.	samy nieritreritra
But they are clearly not.	mazava anefa fa tsy izy ireo
The picture is gone.	lasa ilay sary
There is really nothing difficult about them.	tena tsy misy sarotra aminizy ireo
He had nothing to lose.	tsy nanana na inona na inona ho very izy
It was a wonderful night.	nahafinaritra be io alina io
That’s an easy question.	fanontaniana mora izany
And we don’t need him.	ary tsy mila azy isika
It can never be you.	tsy mety ho ianao mihitsy
In fact, it’s even worse.	raha ny marina dia ratsy kokoa izany
The one who watched you.	ilay nijery anao
He looked at them again.	nijery azy ireo indray izy
Because of recent conversations.	noho ny resaka vao haingana
I may not have enjoyed it very much.	mety tsy nahafinaritra ahy loatra
We really love him.	tena tia azy izahay
There was something there, and he had to see it.	nisy zavatra tao ary tsy maintsy nahita izany izy
But he is right.	marina anefa izy
Mrs.	ny
But not more than two years.	tsy mihoatra ny roa taona anefa
They are like tonight.	toy ny anio alina izy ireo
There, you can go now.	any afaka mandeha ianao izao
One, and another.	iray ary iray hafa
However, many years ago there was no word.	na izany aza taona maro lasa izay tsy nisy teny
Of course, he never did.	mazava ho azy fa tsy nanao izany mihitsy izy
I hope all is well with you.	manantena aho fa tsara aminao ny zavadrehetra
Very good, thank you very much, very good.	tena tsara misaotra indrindra tena tsara
But it’s also different.	saingy hafa ihany koa izany
I love him for that.	tiako izy aminizany
And he stopped and looked at them.	dia nijanona izy ka nijery azy ireo
When you don’t have it, go for something else.	rehefa tsy manana izany ianao dia mandeha aminny zavatra hafa
I looked there.	nijery tao aho
If there was one before, there are now three.	raha nisy iray taloha dia telo izao
Especially for us.	indrindra ho antsika
I may be dead too.	mety ho efa maty ihany koa aho
But the work had to be done.	tsy maintsy natao anefa ilay asa
I always have them.	manana azy ireo foana aho
So that's true.	ka marina izany
Yes, there are some options sometimes.	eny misy safidy sasany indraindray
I shouldn’t be late.	tsy tokony ho ela aho
Too many questions.	be loatra ny fanontaniana
It’s a good job.	asa tsara izany
So they would have watched it.	noho izany dia ho nijery izany izy ireo
You know why, of course.	fantatrao ny antony mazava ho azy
The facts are still there.	mbola misy ny zavamisy
Maybe the truth isn’t just words.	angamba tsy teny fotsiny ny marina
I think he loves you.	heveriko fa tia anao izy
I have no other choice.	tsy manana fomba hafa aho
You said you wouldn't do it.	nilaza ianao fa tsy hanao izany
It's been too long.	efa ela loatra izany
Maybe if you have three cars.	angamba raha manana fiara telo ianao
That’s the story.	izany no tantara
However, this is yet to happen.	na izany aza mbola tsy ho tanteraka izany
You’re so lost, that’s a problem.	very be ianao olana izany
And they really do.	ary tena manao izany izy ireo
That's the truth.	izay ny marina
I hope for something good.	manantena zavatra tsara aho
I'm not good enough.	tsy ampy tsara aho
Hard work.	ny asa mafy
But this is difficult.	sarotra anefa izany
I’m still working on that.	mbola miasa aminizany aho
So yes, absolutely.	ka eny tanteraka
This is never possible but there is always a way.	tsy azo atao mihitsy izany fa misy fomba foana
And it remained that way.	ary nijanona ho toy izany
And he loves it.	ary tiany izany
Many people do.	olona maro no manao izany
That is a good question, in fact.	fanontaniana tsara izany raha ny marina
Yes, that is true.	eny marina izany
Both are not good.	samy tsy tsara
He seems insignificant.	toa tsy misy dikany izy
But you weren’t the first woman to tell me that.	tsy ianao anefa no vehivavy voalohany nilaza izany tamiko
But you know that’s what it is.	saingy fantatrao fa izany no izy
He knew it.	fantany izany
Not the world.	tsy izao tontolo izao
The point is clear.	mazava ny resaka
You can do it !!.	azonao atao izany
I want to be the last.	te ho farany aho
However, it had two major locations.	na izany aza dia nanana toerana roa lehibe izy io
There are too many stories about this man.	be loatra ny tantara momba ity lehilahy ity
He looked at her.	nijery azy izy
There will be no easy results here.	tsy hisy vokatra mora eto
Then he wouldn’t have said other good things.	dia tsy ho nilaza ny zavatra tsara hafa izy
In fact, it may be more accurate.	raha ny marina dia mety ho marina kokoa izany
It’s a new approach for him.	fomba vaovao ho azy izany
It seems like too much work.	toa asa be loatra izany
And that's it, you know.	ary izay ihany fantatrao
for it is enough for him.	fa ampy ho azy izy
That could be wrong.	mety ho diso izany
However, you have.	na izany aza manana ianao
But the facts certainly didn’t make sense.	saingy azo antoka fa tsy nisy dikany ny zavamisy
But it wasn't very fun.	tsy nahafinaritra loatra anefa izany
Everything always came easily to him.	tonga mora taminy foana ny zavadrehetra
If you don’t know that, you’re not wrong.	raha tsy fantatrao izany dia tsy diso ianao
But this place is different.	hafa anefa ity toerana ity
And especially with women.	ary indrindra aminny vehivavy
But enough of them.	fa ampy azy ireo
This meal was delicious.	nahafinaritra io sakafo io
We are two different people.	olona roa samy hafa izahay
He works.	miasa izy
He started now.	nanomboka izao izy
We want to be better.	te ho tsara kokoa izahay
But of course that is not possible.	saingy mazava ho azy fa tsy azo atao izany
That should be good.	tokony ho tsara izany
Looks like no one else is here.	toa tsy misy olona hafa eto
You always do that.	manao izany foana ianao
But he did both.	saingy nanao ireo zavatra roa ireo izy
No men were found.	tsy nisy lehilahy hita
You have no home.	tsy manana trano ianao
It seemed to have no end.	toa tsy nisy farany izany
The ground was very difficult.	sarotra be ny tany tany
Only once.	indray mandeha ihany
Hope this is clear.	manantena fa mazava izany
Look at all these people.	jereo ireo olona rehetra ireo
And not just age.	ary tsy ny taona ihany
It will be too easy for me.	ho mora loatra amiko izany
You are alone and in a very safe place.	irery ianao ary ao aminny toerana tena azo antoka
it is ours.	antsika izany
But not many.	fa tsy ny maro
And then, no.	ary avy eo tsy misy
The action is not small.	tsy kely ny hetsika
I have a problem.	misy olana amiko
Sometimes others deserve it, sometimes they don’t.	indraindray dia mendrika izany ny hafa indraindray tsy mendrika izany
It’s so simple.	tsotra toy izany
The people here.	ny olona eto
He alone did it.	izy irery no nanao izany
Do something good.	hanao zavatra tsara
I need to look at him.	mila mijery azy aho
No one looked at anything.	tsy nisy nijery na inona na inona izy ireo
In the universe.	eo aminizao rehetra izao
That is not enough.	tsy ampy izany
For now, however.	aminizao fotoana izao na izany aza
It all starts with the right process.	izany rehetra izany dia manomboka aminny dingana mety
He has always been there.	efa nisy foana izy
Ela, ela.	ela ela
It just takes time to see it.	mila fotoana fotsiny vao mahita izany
Life is so much more.	fiainana dia be dia be
Certainly we are inferior.	azo antoka fa isika no ambany
A good choice should be a good choice, we hope.	ny safidy tsara dia tokony ho safidy tsara manantena izahay
It’s already been difficult.	efa sarotra izany
I am very happy for him now.	tena faly ho azy aho izao

Not just for him, but for everyone around you.	tsy ho azy ihany fa ho anny olona rehetra manodidina anao
She is good.	tsara izy
Many, many.	maro maro be
It was difficult for him.	sarotra taminy izany
I'm not right.	tsy marina aho
He works another one.	miasa iray hafa izy
The conversation is dead.	maty ilay resaka
That’s good too.	tsara koa izany
And it came quickly.	ary tonga haingana
Or maybe not wrong.	na mety tsy ho diso
Good for you you found one.	tsara ho anao fa nahita iray ianao
We just need a little time now.	mila fotoana kely fotsiny isika izao

Around.	manodidina ny
The cars went well.	nandeha tsara ireo fiara
In the kind of way he likes it.	aminny karazana fomba tiany izany
He did something meaningless and meaningless.	nanao zavatra tsy misy dikany sy tsy misy dikany
We did the same.	nanao izany koa izahay
So it is with us.	toy izany koa ny antsika
But of course it’s a bit difficult now.	saingy mazava ho azy fa somary sarotra izany ankehitriny
Sometimes, he didn’t come to me very often.	indraindray tsy dia matetika izy no tonga tao amiko
And to another and another.	ary aminny iray hafa sy iray hafa
From here, they are very safe.	avy eto dia tena azo antoka izy ireo
They are also very hard.	tena mafy be ihany koa izy ireo
You start fresh.	manomboka vaovao ianao
A house for me personally.	trano ho ahy manokana
Like everything else.	toy ny zavatra hafa rehetra
The truth is it should be faster, faster.	ny marina dia tokony ho haingana kokoa haingana kokoa
Don't do that to him.	aza manao izany aminy
They didn’t do it well.	tsy nanao izany tsara izy ireo
It only means one thing.	zavatra iray ihany no dikany
He will do nothing more.	tsy hanao na inona na inona intsony izy
We love games.	tia lalao izahay
We should be there.	tokony ho eo isika
But that will never happen.	tsy ho tanteraka toy izany mihitsy anefa izany
But there are other questions.	mbola misy fanontaniana hafa anefa
I did not see.	tsy nahita aho
That was it, but not that way.	izay ilay izy fa tsy taminizany fomba izany
That's all right.	mety izany
I could go.	afaka nandeha aho
It’s always been like this.	toy izao foana izany
So glad to see you.	faly be ny mahita anao
There are questions.	misy fanontaniana
I really enjoyed it.	tena nahafinaritra ahy izany
She really loves him.	tena tia azy tokoa izy
It was newer, but completely different from the beginning.	vaovao kokoa ilay izy saingy hafa tanteraka taminny voalohany
And really, really fast.	ary tena tena haingana
This is a very big step.	dingana lehibe tokoa izany
I got the news.	nahazo ny vaovao aho
He went somewhere.	lasa any ho any izy
We should have stopped.	tokony nijanona izahay
You are very sure.	tena azo antoka ianao
He sees it.	izy no mahita izany
There have been no men.	tsy mbola nisy lehilahy

A woman too worthy of him, he said.	vehivavy mendrika loatra ho azy hoy izy
He didn't know.	tsy fantany
It saw him.	nahita azy izany
Of course, it’s really fun and pointless.	mazava ho azy fa tena mahafinaritra sy tsy misy dikany izany
He had a house.	nanana trano izy

So the war came.	ka tonga ny ady
True, he is too.	marina fa izy koa
Both have.	samy manana
These people had time.	ireo olona ireo dia nanana fotoana
A lot of people love you.	betsaka ny olona tia anao

And I’m so happy to have it for myself.	ary tena faly aho manana azy ho ahy irery
It’s also very difficult.	tena sarotra ihany koa
Now, the time is long gone.	ankehitriny efa ela ny fotoana
Or there was.	na nisy izany
He gets them sometimes.	mahazo azy ireo izy indraindray
Of course, no one will do that.	mazava ho azy fa tsy misy olona hanao izany
The inner part.	ny ampahany anatiny
Yes, she told him.	eny hoy izy taminy
But he is right for you.	tena mety aminao anefa izy
Here we disagree.	eto izahay tsy mitovy hevitra
I love having them here.	tiako ny manana azy ireo eto
And he did not.	dia tsy nanao izany izy
The timing couldn’t have been worse.	tsy mety ho ratsy kokoa ny fotoana
I know you look like one.	fantatro fa toa iray ianao
But it's faster.	haingana kokoa anefa izany
Really crazy.	tena adala
I like this idea.	tiako ity hevitra ity
Just watching.	mba mijery fotsiny
No different this year.	tsy misy hafa aminity taona ity
They almost did.	saika nanao izany izy ireo
But this is not true.	tsy marina anefa izany
We finally stopped.	nijanona ihany izahay taminny farany
People get things.	olona mahazo zavatra
Or maybe he didn’t.	na angamba tsy nanao izany izy
You never get it.	tsy azonao mihitsy izany
It is not enough to look once.	tsy ampy ny mijery indray mandeha
Now the problem.	aminizao fotoana izao ny olana
I did not.	tsy nanao izany aho
He was almost a man.	saika lehilahy izy
You can go wrong.	afaka mandeha aminny ratsy ianao
It wasn’t meant for them, he said.	tsy natao ho azy ireo izany hoy izy
He earned a little money.	nahazo vola kely izy
But there is.	saingy misy izany
But the time has come, it’s not like that.	saingy tonga ny fotoana tsy toy izany
It's for you.	ho anao izany
We have everything in order.	manana ny zavadrehetra araka ny tokony ho izy isika
And, if.	ary raha
You have always been there.	efa nisy foana ianao
All of that stuff is real, he thought.	tena misy daholo izany zavatra izany hoy izy nieritreritra
Doing nonsense.	manao zavatra tsy misy dikany
Because if it doesn’t, it’s really bad.	satria raha tsy mety dia tena ratsy
We are not working.	tsy miasa izahay
At the moment.	aminizao fotoana izao
Different from everything else in the world.	hafa avy aminny zavatra hafa rehetra eto aminizao tontolo izao
It’s no different this year but still a little different.	tsy misy hafa aminity taona ity fa mbola hafa kely
Unless, of course, you are human.	raha tsy hoe mazava ho azy fa olona ianao
I hope you enjoyed it.	manantena aho fa nahafinaritra anao izany
It used to be different.	hafa izany taloha
But he is not entirely right.	tsy marina tanteraka anefa izy
You have the whole day.	manana ny tontolo andro ianao
Part one.	ampahany iray
Well, actually.	eny ary raha ny marina
We didn’t get a job.	tsy nahazo asa izahay
He needed time alone.	nila fotoana irery izy
Yes, of course no one knew.	eny azo antoka fa tsy nisy olona fantany
Here’s some good food !.	ity misy sakafo tsara
Yes, they do nonsense.	eny manao zavatra tsy misy dikany izy ireo
Not that fun.	tsy ny mahafinaritra
But that is only part of the problem.	ampahany aminny olana ihany anefa izany
You really are.	tena ianao
And in fact, it might be the best.	ary raha ny marina mety ho ny tsara indrindra izany
He was a great man.	lehilahy lehibe tokoa izy
We must come again.	tsy maintsy ho avy indray isika
It's not real.	tsy tena izy
I have a quick question for you here.	manana fanontaniana haingana ho anao aho eto
See if they can do it.	jereo raha afaka manao azy izy ireo
There was no other work.	tsy nisy asa hafa
Don’t lose it.	aza very izany
Everything went well.	nandeha tsara ny zavadrehetra
She was happy about it.	faly taminizany izy
I look at the time.	mijery ny fotoana aho
This year is a whole new year.	taona vaovao tanteraka ity taona ity
You can do it here.	azonao atao eto izao
However, in general it is.	na izany aza aminny ankapobeny no
He took another step and stopped.	nanao dingana iray indray izy ary nijanona
You may be very useful.	tena ilaina tokoa angamba ianao
We didn’t do too much.	tsy nanao zavatra be loatra izahay
You know that about me.	fantatrao izany momba ahy
That seems true to me.	toa marina izany amiko
I'm too much.	be loatra aho
It didn’t really happen.	tsy tena nisy izany
He did not see.	tsy nahita izy
Not for long.	tsy ela akory
Things will make more sense then.	hisy dikany bebe kokoa ny zavatra avy eo
He didn’t say much to me.	tsy nilaza zavatra betsaka tamiko izy
I saw a real struggle.	tena ady no hitako
And in fact, he didn’t need it.	ary raha ny marina tsy nila izany izy
Either way, it’s a premature choice.	na izany na tsy izany dia safidy aloha loatra izany
The story could be like that.	mety ho toy izany ny tantara
But in fact, this is not the real problem.	saingy raha ny marina dia tsy io no tena olana
We are all selfish.	samy tia tena isika rehetra
He is not there.	tsy eo izy
And there he was, inside.	dia teo izy tao anatiny
It is essential to life.	tena ilaina aminny fiainana izany
I don’t think it was.	heveriko fa tsy nisy izany
It was wonderful to be honest.	tena nahafinaritra ilay hoe marina
He has gone too far now.	lasa lavitra loatra izy izao
But he did not have to go far.	tsy nila nandeha lavitra anefa izy
All the usual fun stuff.	ny zavatra mahafinaritra mahazatra rehetra
But of course, he felt that way.	mazava ho azy anefa fa nieritreritra toy izany izy
That they can do it.	ny hoe afaka manao izany izy ireo
This is one of the big ones.	io no iray aminireo lehibe
However, he wanted them all to come.	na izany aza dia tiany ho tonga daholo izy ireo
They have a place here.	manana toerana eto izy ireo
All of this is true.	marina izany rehetra izany
You have never seen this woman before.	mbola tsy nahita anio vehivavy io mihitsy ianao
It was as if they were not there yet.	toy ny hoe mbola tsy tany izy ireo
Look at the picture.	jereo ny sary
He loves them.	tiany izy ireo
Easy, maybe.	mora angamba
It goes the other way.	mandeha aminny lalana hafa izany
And for you, that’s far worse.	ary ho anao dia ratsy lavitra izany
This is very untrue.	tena tsy marina izany
It will come.	ho avy izany
It is, in fact.	dia izy raha ny marina
Look at the context.	jereo ny teny manodidina
It was a wonderful time for me.	fotoana nahafinaritra ahy izany
But in the end these are just words.	saingy aminny farany dia teny fotsiny ireo
It just goes like that.	mandeha toy izany fotsiny
Three is a difficult year for sure.	ny telo dia taona sarotra azo antoka
Everyone is watching him.	mijery azy ny rehetra
But he had no choice.	tsy nanana safidy anefa izy
He shouldn't do that.	tsy tokony hanao izany izy
He loves things like that.	tiany ny zavatra toy izany
We are in it.	eo aminizany isika
That's it.	izay ilay izy
They do what is necessary.	manao izay ilaina izy ireo
So it is with him.	dia toy izany koa izy
He said they have and they do.	nilaza izy fa manana ary manao izany izy ireo
It’s time, he thought.	fotoana izao hoy izy nieritreritra
They died for him.	maty noho ny aminy izy ireo
We had a good game.	nanana lalao tsara izahay
It's mine too.	ahy koa ilay izy
Don’t start me here.	aza manomboka eto aho
No more pictures.	tsy misy sary intsony
He couldn’t do anything good.	tsy afaka nanao na inona na inona tsara izy
It was really fun.	tena nahafinaritra izany
And maybe that’s a good thing.	ary angamba zavatra tsara izany
The first year went by.	nandeha ny taona voalohany
It can’t be that hard.	tsy mety ho sarotra izany
I think there could be more than that.	heveriko fa mety misy mihoatra noho izany
Everything goes with it.	mandeha aminizany ny zavadrehetra
House with land.	trano misy tany
You have come a long way.	efa lasa lavitra ianao
Almost none.	saika tsy misy mihitsy
Always fun, always good.	mahafinaritra foana tsara foana
And she was a wonderful woman.	ary vehivavy nahafinaritra izy
And it was never a good day.	ary tsy taminny andro tsara mihitsy izany
But it makes sense.	misy dikany anefa izany
I will go crazy too.	ho lasa adala koa aho
But this thing did not exist.	tsy nisy anefa io zavatra io
And it’s fun.	ary mahafinaritra izany
However, the idea is always good.	na izany aza tsara foana ny hevitra
I could have had it all.	afaka nanana azy rehetra aho
Too many people.	ny olona be loatra
Yes, he said.	eny hoy izy
Right or wrong, they needed each other.	na mety na tsy mety dia nila ny tsirairay izy ireo
You seem to be missing out.	hita tsy ampy ianao
Many of them, though.	maro aminizy ireo na dia
This is very new, he told himself.	tena vaovao tokoa izany hoy izy taminny tenany
I don't like anyone.	tsy tia olona aho
Take a good look.	jereo tsara
He looked away.	nijery lavitra izy
So here it is.	ka izao no izy
They just have to work.	tsy maintsy miasa fotsiny izy ireo
He may be wrong.	mety ho diso hevitra izy
It's too hard.	sarotra loatra izany
There are a lot of problems.	betsaka ny olana
Just started doing it.	vao nanomboka nanao izany
We got these things.	nahazo ireo zavatra ireo izahay
But when we went, we didn’t do well.	saingy rehefa nandeha izahay dia tsy nanao tsara
It’s all talk though.	resaka daholo izany na izany aza
There are more houses.	betsaka kokoa ny trano
They work hard.	miasa mafy izy ireo
Others did not see it in the pictures.	ny hafa dia tsy nahita izany taminny sary
But this is worse than usual.	fa ity dia ratsy kokoa noho ny mahazatra
But they had.	saingy nanana izy ireo
I can't see it.	tsy afaka mahita izany
But it will be crowded.	ho feno olona anefa ilay zavatra
The latter is his favorite.	ity farany no tena tiany
He had never done that before.	tsy nanao izany izy taloha
But they can do nothing.	tsy afaka manao na inona na inona anefa izy ireo
The reality is more complicated.	ny zavamisy dia sarotra kokoa
But that is very wrong.	tena tsy mety anefa izany
They are completely wrong.	diso tanteraka izy ireo
However, there may be.	na izany aza mety misy
You have to go.	tsy maintsy mandeha ianao
In fact, he often enjoyed it.	raha ny marina dia nahafinaritra azy matetika izany
And some people did.	ary ny olona sasany dia nanao izany
Both are incorrect.	samy tsy marina
Because everyone else died.	satria maty daholo ny hafa
Very good new idea.	hevitra vaovao tena tsara tokoa
Will do it again next year.	mbola hanao izany indray aminny taona ho avy
This is simply not true.	tsy marina tsotra izao izany
He didn't do it now.	tsy nanao izany izy izao
The whole process is very difficult.	tena sarotra ny dingana rehetra

One or two ideas must be wrong.	tsy maintsy diso ny hevitra iray na roa

He knew he shouldn't have come here.	fantany fa tsy tokony ho tonga eto izy
They are just not like that.	tsy toy izany fotsiny izy ireo

It really makes sense.	tena misy dikany
I started walking.	nanomboka nandeha aho

In fact, it’s a long way off.	raha ny marina dia lavitra be izany

It was all good.	dia tsara daholo
It could have been a lot of fun, for sure.	mety ho tena nahafinaritra ilay izy azo antoka

There is something wrong with this woman.	misy zavatra tsy mety aminity vehivavy ity
Then he left.	dia lasa izy
It already has.	efa nisy izany
The good news came first.	tonga aloha ny vaovao tsara

And it just started.	ary vao nanomboka izany
There are a lot of crazy people there.	betsaka ny olona adala any

There are three steps to this.	misy dingana telo izany
There is only one problem.	iray ihany ny olana
There was just no time.	tsy nisy fotoana fotsiny
I think that’s why.	heveriko fa antony izany
Sometimes he said things to her.	indraindray dia nilaza zavatra ho azy izy

So, we have to do it.	noho izany tsy maintsy manao izany isika

Not enough things needed.	tsy ampy zavatra ilaina
People are great.	lehibe ny olona
Do all the work.	manao ny asa rehetra
He didn’t like it.	tsy tiany izany
He had to travel a long way.	nila nanao dia lavitra izy
And then it went anyway.	ary avy eo dia nandeha na izany aza
But I look at something similar to you.	mijery zavatra mitovy aminny anao anefa aho
There was nothing.	tsy nisy na inona na inona
Not even him.	tsy izy akory
Yes, you are lost.	eny very ianao
That's what's wrong.	izany no tsy mety
However, it is far from the same.	na izany aza dia lavitra ny iray ihany

This is the best time for them.	izany no fotoana tsara indrindra ho azy ireo
The face never stopped.	tsy nijanona mihitsy ilay tarehy
There is no choice.	tsy misy safidy
You are confused.	very hevitra ianao
I'm not happy with you now.	tsy faly aminao aho izao

I see that too.	hitako koa izany
Of course, it won’t be complete.	mazava ho azy fa tsy ho feno izany
When you get too far.	rehefa lasa lavitra ianao

What used to be easy is hard now.	ny mora taloha dia sarotra ankehitriny
He knows about me.	fantany ny momba ahy

That's enough, he thought.	ampy izay hoy izy nieritreritra
Maybe they aren’t.	angamba tsy izy ireo
Better on some things, yes, but.	tsara kokoa aminny zavatra sasany eny fa
He had to think about it.	tsy maintsy nieritreritra momba azy izy
And if we don’t, we lack something.	ary raha tsy izany isika dia tsy ampy zavatra
Maybe, maybe, maybe.	angamba angamba angamba
But you have a choice.	saingy manana safidy ianao
It’s usually a real -time job.	aminny ankapobeny dia asa aminny fotoana tena izy io
Just an ordinary guy.	lehilahy mahazatra fotsiny
The truth is they had nothing.	ny marina dia tsy nanana na inona na inona izy ireo
It works like that.	miasa toy izany
We are too selfish.	tia tena loatra isika
However, they certainly do the same.	na izany aza azo antoka fa manao toa azy izy ireo
Now it becomes difficult.	ankehitriny dia lasa sarotra
That’s all true, you know.	marina daholo izany fantatrao
He does a lot of it tonight.	manao izany betsaka izy anio alina
And many fools do that.	ary maro ny adala manao izany
They were left alone.	nijanona irery izy ireo
You know this stuff over time.	fantatrao izany zavatra izany rehefa mandeha ny fotoana
We do that.	manao izany izahay
You never know what exactly is in it.	tsy fantatrao mihitsy hoe inona marina no ao anatiny
Not for you, or for him.	tsy ho anao na ho azy
There has to be one about it.	tsy maintsy misy iray momba izany
This is not true here.	tsy marina izany eto
He really stayed on track.	tena nijanona teo aminny lalana izy
And he won't be here.	ary tsy ho eto izy
I love this place too.	tiako koa io toerana io
A very good place.	toerana iray tena tsara
He alone got it all.	izy irery no nahazo izany rehetra izany
The car was fun.	nahafinaritra ny fiara
There were others.	mbola nisy hafa koa izy ireo
Too much to lose.	be loatra ny very
Problems with the latter.	olana aminity farany
Or soon.	na tsy ela
Otherwise, it is not.	raha tsy izany dia tsy izany
He was a man and had to die.	lehilahy izy ka tsy maintsy maty
He is too good.	tsara loatra izy
Not so either.	tsy izany ihany koa
In fact, he was a good man.	raha ny marina dia lehilahy tsara izy
I think you are wrong.	heveriko fa diso lalana ianao
But he knew something.	nisy zavatra iray anefa fantany
There’s a lot of great stuff in this.	be dia be ny zavatra lehibe aminity
We don’t like him.	tsy tia azy izahay
It seems like it will make sense.	toy ny hoe hisy dikany izany
And it could be the same.	ary mety ho toy izany koa
However, there are often problems with this method.	na izany aza matetika misy olana aminity fomba ity
Or any other place.	na toerana hafa
But he finds himself alone.	saingy mahita ny tenany irery izy
I enjoy doing all kinds of work.	faly aho manao karazana asa rehetra
But no thanks.	fa tsy misaotra
But it’s far more than certain.	fa lehibe lavitra noho ny azo antoka
I really need to do something about it.	tena tokony hanao zavatra momba izany aho
Fun stuff, they are.	zavatra mahafinaritra izy ireo
This is a great thing.	zavatra lehibe ity
Everyone might have looked that way.	mety ho nijery izany lalana izany ny rehetra
The man will not come alone.	tsy ho avy irery ilay lehilahy
And saw him again.	ary nahita azy indray
Not right now.	tsy aminizao fotoana izao
It was hard work.	asa mafy ilay izy
I was glad to see him.	faly aho nahita azy
The reasons are as follows.	ny antony dia toy izao manaraka izao
and all that.	ary izany rehetra izany
There are many ways.	misy fomba maro
We were able to keep going.	afaka nandeha hatrany izahay
Starting with no.	manomboka aminny no
If not the largest.	raha tsy ny lehibe indrindra
And he likes it, because it’s crazy.	ary tiany izany satria adala
Someone has already done that.	efa nisy nanao izany
You enjoy it.	mahafinaritra anao izany
That's enough for him.	ampy azy izany
Probably for a reason.	noho ny antony angamba
And they both have stories.	ary samy manana tantara izy ireo
Just up front.	eo aloha ihany
So, like that.	noho izany toy izany
He already knew that.	efa fantany izany
It’s really fun, because it’s simple.	tena mahafinaritra satria tsotra
I know it was made for me.	fantatro fa natao ho ahy izany
It doesn’t seem to come.	toa tsy tonga
Yes, it is possible.	eny azo atao izany
But it could be.	mety ho izany anefa
I am always here.	eto foana aho
They are too.	izy ireo koa
But not, of course.	saingy tsy izany mazava ho azy
We thank them.	misaotra azy ireo izahay
It seems like years.	toa taona maro izany
And that is the reality.	ary izany no zavamisy
As for.	raha ny momba ny
They told the truth.	nilaza ny marina izy ireo
It really is a must.	tena tsy maintsy izany
Even if they are crazy.	na dia adala aza izy ireo
He knows everything.	fantany ny zavadrehetra
It exists now.	misy izany aminizao fotoana izao
But it takes time and good reason.	mila fotoana sy antony tsara anefa izany
I hope good news from that.	manantena vaovao tsara avy aminizany aho
It was all fun.	nahafinaritra ny rehetra taminizany
But now it doesn't seem necessary.	toa tsy ilaina anefa izany ankehitriny
But that was a long time ago.	efa ela anefa izay
That is not the way.	tsy izany no fomba
They are not all the same.	tsy mitovy izy rehetra
I knew he would never do that.	fantatro fa tsy hanao izany mihitsy izy
Because he knew.	satria fantany
I can't do this.	tsy afaka manao toy izao aho
I love you, you say.	tiako ianao hoy ianao
It hasn’t happened yet, but it will happen, and it won’t happen soon.	tsy mbola nisy izany fa mbola hisy ary tsy ho ela
Or maybe he just knew.	na angamba fantany fotsiny
You don't like him.	tsy tia azy ianao
For us tonight.	ho antsika anio alina
Very beautiful.	tena tsara tarehy
And, he was a very handsome man.	ary tena lehilahy tsara tarehy tokoa izy
It really should be.	tena tokony ho izany tokoa
But that is not always the case.	tsy izany foana anefa
But it didn’t happen.	saingy tsy nisy izany
Apparently they had.	hita fa nanana izy ireo
Everything there is completely new and completely different.	ny zavadrehetra ao dia vaovao tanteraka ary hafa tanteraka
Maybe that's wrong.	diso angamba izany
They seem familiar.	toa mahazatra azy ireo
She had seen the man before.	efa nahita anio lehilahy io izy taloha
He certainly will.	azo antoka fa hanao izany izy
I am not a free person.	tsy olona afaka aho
We didn’t do those things.	tsy nanao ireo zavatra ireo izahay
It was almost non -existent.	saika tsy nisy intsony izany
But he is a fool.	adala anefa izy
We are not alone now.	tsy isika irery izao
Here in this beautiful place anything is possible.	eto aminity toerana mahafinaritra ity dia azo atao ny zavatra rehetra
The other thing is mine.	ny zavatra hafa dia ahy
They were basically the same car.	fiara iray ihany izy ireo taminny ankapobeny
They stopped and looked at him.	nijanona izy ireo ary nijery azy
Or it can’t.	na tsy afaka izany
They didn’t know they were wrong.	tsy fantany fa diso izy ireo
I was not alone then.	tsy irery aho taminizany
I almost always do that.	saika manao izany foana aho
Yes of course.	eny mazava ho azy
But that is not possible.	saingy tsy azo atao izany
We are beautiful, ugly.	tsara tarehy izahay ratsy tarehy
So we went.	dia nandeha izahay
It's not that bad.	tsy dia ratsy izany
This is not a game.	tsy lalao izany
Not always.	tsy izany foana
Now he has.	ankehitriny dia efa nanao izany izy
Thank you so much.	misaotra betsaka azy
Not because of something like this.	tsy noho ny zavatra toy izao
Some will be more difficult than others.	ny sasany dia ho sarotra kokoa noho ny hafa
No one was there.	tsy nisy olona teo
It was one of those times.	iray aminireo fotoana ireo izany
That seems a long way off.	toa lavitra be izany
He is a good person.	olona tsara izy
In fact, he didn’t.	raha ny marina dia tsy nanao izany izy
There are a lot of people like that.	betsaka ny olona toy izany
As if nothing really happened.	toy ny hoe tsy misy tokoa
I can't be alone.	tsy afaka ny ho irery aho
Some of them are better for you than others.	ny sasany aminizy ireo dia mety aminao kokoa noho ny hafa
Watch the time.	jereo ny fotoana
Too much, really.	be loatra tena
But find something better.	fa mahita zavatra tsara kokoa
We did something.	nanao zavatra izahay
That’s a really good idea.	tena hevitra tsara izany
Yes, maybe it is.	eny angamba izany
I think that’s about it.	heveriko fa momba izany
He had to think fast.	tsy maintsy nieritreritra haingana izy
I still do all these things.	mbola manao ireo zavatra rehetra ireo aho
But they are not really dead yet.	saingy mbola tsy tena maty izy ireo
Worse than bad.	ratsy noho ny ratsy
This is not the end.	tsy izao no farany
All these fun things.	ireo zavatra mahafinaritra rehetra ireo
They all agree.	mitovy hevitra izy rehetra
I know you like it.	fantatro fa tianao izany
That’s about me.	izay no momba ahy
We need them more than ever.	mila azy ireo mihoatra noho ny taloha isika
He did it.	izy no nanao izany
You got nothing.	tsy nahazo na inona na inona ianao
He was sure.	nahazo antoka izy
I just didn’t look.	tsy nijery fotsiny aho
They want to do something.	te hanao zavatra izy ireo
And you know he will.	ary fantatrao fa hanao izany izy
No other news there.	tsy misy vaovao hafa any
It will not be so for you.	tsy ho toy izany aminao izany
He went well and fast.	nandeha tsara sy haingana izy
I love you, yes.	tiako ianao eny
It’s a great place.	toerana lehibe izy io
And it was bad there.	ary ratsy izany tao
It’s not far from bad.	tsy lavitra ny ratsy izany
No one is even close.	tsy misy olona akaiky akory
Maybe it’s just part of the process.	angamba ampahany aminny dingana ihany izany
But in the end it came to me.	saingy taminny farany dia tonga tamiko izany
It's still small.	mbola kely ihany izany
I’m just not pretty.	tsy tsara tarehy fotsiny aho
I don’t want him to come to you.	tsy tiako ho tonga aminao izy
He is worse than that.	ratsy noho izany izy
It wasn’t that big before.	tsy dia lehibe izany taloha
I absolutely love him.	tena tia azy tanteraka aho
He thought about them.	nieritreritra momba azy ireo izy
They come often.	tonga matetika izy ireo
But they are not the same word.	saingy tsy teny mitovy izy ireo
This is often done.	izany no atao matetika
First, people have to come to themselves.	voalohany ny olona dia tsy maintsy ho tonga ny tenany
And they are so much more than just roads.	ary izy ireo dia tena mihoatra lavitra noho ny lalana
But he is dead.	efa maty anefa izy
I will always do.	hanao foana aho
You started it all.	ianao no nanomboka izany rehetra izany
But it is possible.	azo atao anefa izany
Often this is not the case.	matetika no tsy izany
You might follow.	mety ho manaraka ianao
You can do anything.	afaka manao na inona na inona ianao
I am like that.	toy izany aho
But in fact, no.	fa raha ny marina tsy
This is completely wrong.	diso tanteraka izany
But now she is starting a new phase in her life.	nanomboka dingana vaovao eo aminny fiainana anefa izy izao
And you get it.	ary azonao izany
Very functional home.	trano tena miasa
We got enough.	nahazo ampy izahay
When you do something, that’s all it takes.	rehefa manao zavatra dia izay ihany no atao
Eventually it will come.	aminny farany dia ho avy izany
It was really fun.	tena nahafinaritra ilay izy
This is the problem.	izao no olana
This is a very difficult problem.	olana sarotra be izany
The other is not to do it.	ny iray hafa dia ny tsy hanao izany
But the facts are not exactly the same.	tsy mitovy tanteraka anefa ny zavamisy
Sometimes we all get a little crazy.	lasa adala kely daholo isika indraindray
These are probably my favorite.	ireo angamba no tiako indrindra
We all do them.	isika rehetra no manao azy ireo
But it was even worse.	mbola ratsy kokoa anefa ilay izy
I thought the food was good.	nieritreritra aho fa tsara ny sakafo
It may be different for you.	mety ho hafa aminao izany
But he must do so.	tsy maintsy manao izany anefa izy
Even the place went well.	na ny toerana dia nandeha tsara
Every place and every person.	ny toerana rehetra sy ny olona rehetra
They are not women.	tsy vehivavy izy ireo
This one is perfect.	ity iray ity dia mety
Then the reason.	avy eo ny antony
About the big idea.	momba ny hevitra lehibe
Here's what you can do.	toy izao koa ny azonao atao
You want to do that.	te hanao izany ianao
Of course, that’s a good thing.	mazava ho azy fa zavatra tsara izany
I take one step, and another.	manao dingana iray aho ary iray hafa
Although not entirely.	na dia tsy izany tanteraka aza
To be stupid.	ny hoe adala
We have grown up.	efa lehibe izahay
I see a big step forward.	mahita dingana lehibe aho
These women, of course.	ireo vehivavy ireo mazava ho azy
This is usually not difficult.	matetika dia tsy sarotra izany
But that path is no longer available.	tsy misy intsony anefa izany lalana izany ankehitriny
It went well.	nandeha tsara izany
We were able to do that.	afaka nanao izany izahay
Very simple.	tsotra tokoa
Start at the bottom.	manomboka aminny farany ambany
But he loved her.	tiany anefa ilay vehivavy
He is small.	kely izy
Still in general.	mbola aminny ankapobeny
I'm really happy with that.	tena faly aho aminizany
It should be, but it’s not.	tokony ho izany fa tsy izany
They love me again.	tia ahy indray izy ireo
It too.	io koa
But it will do more.	mbola hanao zavatra bebe kokoa anefa izany
It becomes too difficult.	lasa sarotra loatra
It’s definitely better.	azo antoka fa tsara kokoa izany
He didn’t, and he still doesn’t.	tsy nanao izany izy ary mbola tsy manao izany
He never had a job.	tsy nanana asa mihitsy izy
It seems real.	toa tena misy izany
A question came to me.	nisy fanontaniana tonga tamiko
One is clear.	mazava ny iray
A little about it.	kely momba izany
I am very happy.	tena faly aho
I almost didn’t.	saika tsy nanao izany aho
I can't do it alone.	tsy afaka manao izany irery aho
Especially as a low top.	indrindra fa toy ny ambany ambony
He had never done anything like this before.	mbola tsy nanao zavatra toy izao mihitsy izy
But we still had a great time.	saingy mbola nanana fotoana mahafinaritra izahay
Each of them is a small picture of me.	ny tsirairay aminizy ireo dia sary kely momba ahy
But there are very strong men.	fa misy lehilahy mafy be
Neither do you.	tsy ianao koa
Not so much fun when there wasn’t.	tsy dia mahafinaritra rehefa tsy nisy
But so are you.	fa toy izany koa ianao
No one in particular.	tsy misy olona manokana
Not too long ago.	tsy ela akory izay
The choice is quick.	haingana ny safidy
But that will not be long.	tsy ho ela anefa izany
It seemed so simple.	toa tsotra be ilay izy
Sometimes you are the result.	indraindray ianao no vokatra
Sometimes it’s harder than other times.	sarotra kokoa noho ny fotoana hafa izany indraindray
Only a small amount of money is needed.	vola kely ihany no ilaina
Then it came to him.	dia tonga aminy izany
It’s really not very good.	tena tsy dia tsara loatra izany
The previous option is not possible.	ny safidy teo aloha dia tsy azo atao
At all times.	aminny fotoana rehetra
This is especially true of men.	marina indrindra izany teo aminny lehilahy
It stayed there.	nijanona teo izy io
Not unless they’re upstairs, he said.	tsy raha tsy any ambony izy ireo hoy izy
The process just works.	miasa fotsiny ny dingana
No, there wasn't.	tsia tsy nisy
He will love it.	ho tiany izany
It’s the same for me, often.	toy izany koa amiko matetika
But when you love them, it won’t be enough.	saingy rehefa tia azy ireo ianao dia tsy ho ampy
The question of why is a question of fact.	ny fanontaniana momba ny antony dia fanontaniana momba ny zavamisy
And that’s a really good thing, actually.	ary izany dia zavatra tena tsara raha ny marina
He is no longer here.	tsy eto intsony izy izao
I'm new to this.	vaovao aminizany aho
Not too fast.	tsy haingana loatra
And it was still there.	ary mbola teo foana izany
Look at him now.	jereo izy izao
A little more here.	somary kely kokoa eto
They saw no problem.	tsy nahita olana izy ireo
Thank you for saying that.	misaotra anao nilaza izany
I started again.	nanomboka indray aho
You must be crazy.	tsy maintsy adala ianao
In fact, it is.	raha ny marina dia
That sounds like a good idea.	toa hevitra tsara izany
It went immediately.	dia nandeha avy hatrany
They are both the same.	mitovy izy roa
It came to that, finally.	tonga taminizany izany taminny farany
And he's still young.	ary mbola kely izy
But don’t make this game too hard.	aza atao mafy loatra anefa ity lalao ity
Yes, it is different.	eny hafa izany
He is tough.	mafy izy
He loved her.	tiany izy
Finally, there really is.	farany kokoa tena misy
But there had to be a better way.	tsy maintsy nisy fomba tsara kokoa anefa
For them, it’s fun.	ho azy ireo dia mahafinaritra
There will still be games.	mbola hisy ny lalao
They are very good.	tena tsara izy ireo
Great choice is great choice of product.	ny safidy lehibe dia safidy lehibe aminny vokatra
You might as well.	mety ho azonao koa
We had an easy life.	nanana fiainana mora izahay
I saw the action.	hitako ilay hetsika
But sometimes.	saingy indraindray
It's very fast.	tena haingana izany
As a result, the work becomes more one and more.	noho izany ny asa dia lasa maro ny iray sy ny
An impossible one.	iray tsy azo atao
Yes, whatever.	eny na inona na inona
You are one.	iray ianao
There wasn’t much there.	tsy nisy zavatra betsaka tao
This is very important to me.	tena zavadehibe izany amiko
Some are big and some are not so big.	ny sasany lehibe ary ny sasany tsy dia lehibe
The problem is it doesn’t work.	ny olana dia tsy mandeha izany
This is indeed true.	marina tokoa izany
He also owned other lands.	nanana tany hafa koa izy
He is the real thing.	izy no tena izy
So that's not the problem.	ka tsy izay no olana
I don't know very well.	tsy fantatro tsara
It was far away.	lavitra ilay izy
He didn't even have a house.	tsy nanana trano akory izy
He does it for her.	izy no manao izany ho azy
That's where the problem lies.	eo no misy ny olana
It’s always so much fun to be with you.	tena mahafinaritra foana ny miaraka aminao
They just watch.	mijery fotsiny izy ireo
It takes a while to get it.	mila fotoana kely vao mahazo azy
So, we.	noho izany isika
And harder.	ary mafy kokoa
I’ve been all over it.	efa tany rehetra aho
Maybe they were meaningless.	angamba tsy nisy dikany izy ireo
There he is, here.	ao izy eto
Good to be personal.	tsara ny manokana
Yes, sometimes.	eny indraindray
Then they are right.	dia mety izy ireo
Yes, very good indeed.	eny tena tsara tokoa
Apparently this is not enough.	hita fa tsy ampy izany
We did it all ourselves.	izahay ihany no nanao izany rehetra izany
I was happy there.	faly aho tany
But no one stopped.	tsy nisy nijanona anefa
There should be no discussion.	tsy tokony hisy resaka
Like never before.	toy ny tsy nisy mihitsy
Only once, and it’s been a long time.	indray mandeha ihany ary efa ela be izany
Well.	eny ary
You can do it from here.	azonao atao izany avy eto
No, that's not a problem.	tsia tsy olana izany
And if someone dies, it’s something else.	ary raha misy maty dia zavatra hafa izany
Man watching.	lehilahy mijery
Make them easy.	ataovy mora izy ireo
I personally like it.	tiako manokana izany
It was never a problem.	tsy nisy olana mihitsy izany
In the end.	aminny farany
Very happy for you.	faly be ho anao
Make the good parts big.	ataovy lehibe ny ampahany tsara
I watch every game of every game.	mijery ny lalao rehetra aminny lalao rehetra aho
But the truth is, there was no such news there.	saingy ny marina dia tsy nisy ny vaovao toy izany tany
They will know it.	ho fantany izany
I do not like.	tsy tiako
It didn’t seem too big.	toa tsy dia lehibe loatra ilay izy
I'm too good.	tsara loatra aho
There are two ways around this.	misy fomba roa manodidina izany
One is a woman.	vehivavy ny iray
The same is true when someone dies.	toy izany koa rehefa misy maty
Not that he was really a man.	tsy hoe tena lehilahy tokoa izy
This is important to me.	zavadehibe amiko izany
He had never seen them that night.	mbola tsy nahita azy ireo mihitsy izy taminny alina
He came to that.	tonga taminizany izy
It shouldn’t be, it’s just the truth.	tsy tokony ho izany fa ny marina ihany
But he did die.	fa maty tokoa
It could be really bad, it could be good.	mety ho tena ratsy izany mety ho tsara
No choice.	tsy nahazo safidy
But this is not true in reality.	tsy marina anefa izany raha ny marina
This other thing, no.	ity zavatra hafa ity tsia
There is a little time.	misy fotoana kely
The war has not yet begun.	mbola tsy nanomboka ny ady
They could be something you like.	mety ho zavatra tianao izy ireo
Too easy.	mora loatra
Not so either.	tsy toy izany koa
He knows the truth.	fantany ny marina
Each path is different.	samy hafa ny lalana tsirairay
He is right on a lot of issues.	marina aminny olana maro be izy
But that night was different.	hafa anefa io alina io
This is kind of special here.	ity dia karazana manokana eto
This is not always true.	tsy marina foana izany
The worst kind of woman.	ny karazana vehivavy ratsy indrindra
Or just, you know, here.	na fotsiny fantatrao eto
Both of them.	izy roa ireo
I could have done something.	afaka nanao zavatra aho
They just left.	lasa fotsiny izy ireo
I see it as a part of life.	hitako ho toy ny ampahany aminny fiainana izany
I still love the story.	mbola tiako ny tantara
But none of these work anymore.	saingy tsy misy miasa intsony ireo
But, in the end, we may take some steps.	saingy aminny farany mety hanao dingana sasany isika
The problem with you.	ny olana miaraka aminao
However, of course, the two are not the same.	na izany aza mazava ho azy fa tsy mitovy ny roa
They always deserve to be first.	mendrika ny ho voalohany foana izy ireo
And that is completely wrong.	ary diso tanteraka izany
Many of the large houses around had them.	maro aminireo trano lehibe manodidina no nanana azy ireo
One with him.	iray miaraka aminy
Which is not fun.	izay tsy mahafinaritra
Someone said something.	nisy nilaza zavatra
Of course he knew that.	mazava ho azy fa fantany izany
The past works in the present.	ny lasa dia miasa aminny ankehitriny
Even worse.	mbola ratsy kokoa koa
I don’t see the time anymore.	tsy hitako intsony ny fotoana
Whatever he wants.	na inona na inona tiany
You are too good to me.	tsara loatra tamiko ianao
I just don’t like them.	tsy tiako fotsiny izy ireo
Because it can’t be.	satria tsy mety ho
A little more than nothing.	somary mihoatra noho ny tsy misy
Look here, here and here.	jereo eto eto ary eto
He is selfish.	tia tena izy
Or not much.	na tsy misy zavatra betsaka
That is indeed the reality.	izany tokoa no zavamisy
Everything is simple.	ny asa rehetra dia tsotra
This is good for them.	tsara ho azy ireo izany
I was real.	tena nisy aho
He was once a man.	efa lehilahy izy indray mandeha
You do something.	manao zavatra ianao
And get this.	ary mahazo ity
There is something wrong with him.	misy zavatra tsy mety aminy
But there is no money in it.	tsy misy vola anefa ao
I love it, man.	tiako izany lehilahy
I had to do better.	tsy maintsy nanao tsara kokoa aho
He must be crazy.	tsy maintsy adala izy
For all of us.	ho antsika rehetra
I find that men are harder than women.	hitako fa sarotra kokoa noho ny vehivavy ny lehilahy
He has seen me.	efa nahita ahy izy
It's good for him.	tsara ny aminy
Doing a lot of good things.	manao zavatra maro tsara
It was fun to see.	nahafinaritra ny nahita
It is a very simple task.	asa tena tsotra izany
Even for me.	na aminny ahy aza
And it certainly is.	ary azo antoka fa tanteraka izany
This is still the best way.	mbola io no fomba tsara indrindra
But he was far away.	lavitra anefa izy
She loves going there.	tiany ny mandeha any
He shouldn't even be there.	tsy tokony ho any akory izy
Action is what it is.	ny hetsika dia inona izany
It doesn't suit me.	tsy mety amiko izany
Of course, that is all the problem.	mazava ho azy fa izany no olana rehetra
But maybe it should.	fa angamba tokony ho izany
Of course I do.	mazava ho azy fa manao izany aho
Each.	tsirairay
Today is different.	hafa ny ankehitriny
But that's enough.	fa ampy izay
He was never like that.	tsy mba toy izany mihitsy izy
But if one is not wrong, it is wrong.	raha tsy diso anefa ny olona iray dia diso izany
One of my favorites.	iray aminireo tiako indrindra
He didn't.	tsy nanao izany izy
The day was a different day for everyone.	ny andro dia andro hafa ho anny rehetra
He will be worthy of it.	ho mendrika aminizany izy
At the moment, this is still not the case.	aminizao fotoana izao dia mbola tsy misy izany
They just have to walk a long way.	tsy maintsy mandeha lavitra fotsiny izy ireo
That may be true.	mety ho marina izany
But he knew it was wrong.	fantany anefa fa tsy mety izany
Some of them seem familiar.	ny sasany aminizy ireo dia toa mahazatra
Each of them.	ny tsirairay aminizy ireo
They are very similar to people.	tena mitovy aminny olona izy ireo
I just don’t like it.	tsy tiako fotsiny
To stop loving him, yes.	mba tsy ho tia azy intsony eny
It’s a really fun game.	tena lalao mahafinaritra io
You are an adult now.	efa lehibe ianao izao
They may not be too many to begin with.	mety ho tsy dia be loatra izy ireo vao manomboka
You can .	ianao dia afaka
He wanted it for me.	tiany ho ahy izany
He didn't go far.	tsy lasa lavitra izy
The same goes for work.	toy izany koa ho anny asa
He is still a handsome man.	mbola lehilahy tsara tarehy izy
They are.	izy ireo
Sometimes two or three.	indraindray roa na telo
So no one is close enough.	ka tsy misy akaiky akaiky
But the game was too much fun.	nahafinaritra loatra anefa ilay lalao
And he went out by night.	dia nandeha taminny alina izy
I am not a special person.	tsy olona manokana aho
He didn't need to see it.	tsy nila nahita izany izy
Sometimes we go crazy.	lasa adala isika indraindray
It’s a little safe.	tena azo antoka kely izy io
We are glad you are here, and we are with you.	faly izahay fa eto ianao ary miaraka aminao izahay
But there are other options.	misy safidy hafa anefa
Either way.	na inona na inona fomba natao
It’s not true that he could see.	tsy marina fa afaka nahita izy
I had nothing.	tsy nanana na inona na inona aho
It was as if he were dead.	toy ny hoe maty izy
In reality, however, this did not make sense.	tsy nisy dikany anefa izany raha ny marina
I had a good life.	nanana fiainana tsara aho
It’s not a distant thing in the future.	tsy zavatra lavitra izany aminny ho avy
It’s because of you.	noho ianao izany
Only for us.	ho antsika ihany
But many years ago.	saingy taona maro lasa izay
But that has been a long time coming.	efa ela be anefa izany
I walk alone, which is good.	mandeha irery aho izay tsara
Both are great.	samy lehibe
It will be better.	ho tsara kokoa izany
She looks fun.	toa mahafinaritra izy
He was certainly not alone.	azo antoka fa tsy irery tao izy
And the news is good.	ary tsara ny vaovao
I don't think that's true.	heveriko fa tsy marina izany
I know that way.	fantatro io lalana io
The closest.	izay akaiky indrindra
He is not walking.	tsy mandeha izy
And you are no different.	ary tsy misy hafa ianao
In fact, it’s not even close.	raha ny marina dia tsy akaiky akory izany
There is no such problem in the current way.	tsy misy olana toy izany aminny fomba ankehitriny
Yes, it has to be.	eny tsy maintsy ho izany
It goes without saying.	izy io dia mandeha ho azy
There is nothing more real than this moment.	tsy misy zavatra tena misy kokoa noho ity fotoana ity
It does the work you love.	manao ny asa tianao izy io
But they may have had it.	mety ho nanana izany anefa izy ireo
Either way, that's enough.	na izany na tsy izany dia ampy izay
He is the best.	izy no tsara indrindra
Many of them are not good.	maro aminizy ireo no tsy tsara
There is talk of a problem.	misy resaka momba ny olana
He is below.	eo ambany izy
Had no no.	tsy nanana no
I just went.	nandeha fotsiny aho
Either way, the results will be bad.	na izany na tsy izany dia ho ratsy ny vokatra
That would be good.	ho tsara izany
I could see well without them.	afaka nahita tsara aho raha tsy nisy azy ireo
But now.	fa izao dia izao
Whatever is done.	na inona na inona atao
It’s so simple.	tena tsotra toy izany
They are not.	tsy izy ireo
I am only one person.	olona iray ihany aho
No, this place has more meaning than that.	tsia manana dikany bebe kokoa noho izany io toerana io
I don't need that information.	tsy mila izany vaovao izany aho
There is no food in it.	tsy misy sakafo ao anatiny
You can't see me now.	tsy afaka mahita ahy ianao izao
Then you have no idea.	dia tsy manana hevitra ianao
But anything is possible.	saingy azo atao ny zavatra rehetra
But they will know it.	saingy ho fantany izany
Not even where he is.	tsy ny toerana misy azy akory
That’s kind of important.	karazana zavadehibe izany
Everyone’s choice.	safidy ny tsirairay
And it is absolutely right to do so.	ary marina tanteraka ny manao izany
Another time, another year.	fotoana hafa taona hafa
It’s not really that bad.	tsy tena ratsy izany
We were confused, a day ago.	very hevitra izahay andro iray lasa izay
This was the real problem for me.	io no tena olana tamiko
I want mine to be a good story.	tiako ho tantara tsara ny ahy
Kind of fun.	karazana mahafinaritra
You are never lost.	tsy very mihitsy ianao
And we haven’t seen it in a long time.	ary efa ela izahay no tsy nahita anio
That’s a really good thing.	tena zavatra tsara izany
She is very beautiful, to everyone.	tena tsara tarehy izy aminny olona rehetra
These men are the best.	ireo lehilahy ireo no tsara indrindra
This is unusual in history.	tsy mahazatra izany eo aminny tantara
It seems a bit faster.	toa somary haingana kokoa izany
Something was missing.	nisy zavatra tsy ampy
And it doesn’t make sense.	ary tsy misy dikany izany
I love everything about him.	tiako daholo ny momba azy
There were still no houses to be found.	mbola tsy nisy trano ho hita
They need it fast.	mila haingana izy ireo
If you don’t like it, don’t.	raha tsy tianao dia aza
No, he could not have thought of such a thing.	tsia tsy afaka nieritreritra zavatra toy izany izy
Yes, they are very similar, in general.	eny tena mitovy izy ireo aminny ankapobeny
But there was a bigger question.	nisy fanontaniana lehibe kokoa anefa
Saw what was found.	nahita ny zavatra hita
I'm not wrong.	tsy diso aho
He looks really crazy.	toa adala tokoa izy
It is very safe now.	tena azo antoka izany ankehitriny
He certainly does.	azo antoka fa manao izany izy
In fact, no one does that.	raha ny marina tsy misy olona manao izany
Not enough time.	tsy ampy ny fotoana
If not, this is certainly true.	raha tsy izany dia marina tokoa izany
The problem is, he needed to do a little more.	ny olana dia nila nanao kely kokoa izy
I didn't say anything to him.	tsy nilaza na inona na inona taminy aho
It's a wonderful place.	toerana mahafinaritra io
This is the highest.	ity no ambony indrindra
No problem.	tsy misy olana
At the time it had none.	taminizany fotoana izany dia tsy nanana
That's all .	izay ihany
When he gets closer, he is even smaller.	rehefa akaiky akaiky izy dia mbola kely kokoa
I'm not right at all.	tsy mety mihitsy aho
That's too good.	tsara loatra izany
I will be there soon.	ho any aho tsy ho ela
He is not big, but he will get bigger over time.	tsy lehibe izy fa ho lehibe kokoa rehefa mandeha ny fotoana
They are wonderful people.	olona mahafinaritra izy ireo
But they do not.	tsy manao izany anefa izy ireo
I saw it all.	hitako daholo izany
It is not made for you.	tsy natao ho anao izany
It’s like it’s crazy.	toy ny hoe adala izany
Surely you are not like that.	azo antoka fa tsy toy izany ianao
These are just ideas.	hevitra fotsiny ireo
I disagree with that, actually.	tsy mitovy hevitra aminizany aho raha ny marina
But that seems wrong.	toa diso anefa izany
If you like it, it’s fun.	raha tianao dia mahafinaritra
It also looked kind of decent.	nijery karazana mendrika ihany koa
But here's why.	fa izao no antony
Not where it is.	tsy any aminny toerana misy azy io
It wasn't much, but it was his.	tsy dia be ilay izy fa azy ilay izy
It's been a long time coming.	efa ela no natao
No one is watching us here.	tsy misy mijery anay eto
That may be true.	marina angamba izany
Indeed, there is nothing wrong with this.	eny tokoa tsy misy diso izao
Overall, it went really well.	aminny ankapobeny tena nandeha tsara izany
But the work has already begun.	saingy efa manomboka ny asa
It is a new world.	tontolo vaovao no azy
All of these activities require a lot of money.	mila vola be ireo hetsika rehetra ireo
This kind of work.	ity karazana asa ity
He also looked around.	nijery manodidina koa izy
See it below.	jereo eto ambany izy
And it can never be that way again.	ary tsy mety ho toy izany intsony
The night was wonderful.	nahafinaritra ny alina
There is no way it can look good.	tsy misy fomba afaka mijery tsara
It works for everyone, at all times.	miasa ho anny rehetra izy io aminny fotoana rehetra
You can see everything.	afaka mijery ny zavadrehetra ianao
This is not new again.	tsy vaovao indray izany
Sometimes we need something else.	indraindray dia mila zavatra hafa isika
He can't walk far.	tsy afaka mandeha lavitra izy
He started the game.	izy no nanomboka ny lalao
It's the same now.	toy izany ihany ankehitriny
That's enough, too much.	ampy izay be loatra
Either way, it’s not very fun to watch them.	na izany na tsy izany tsy dia mahafinaritra loatra ny mijery azy ireo
How far? 	hatrany lavitra
Both cars stopped.	nijanona ny fiara roa
This is not the worst.	tsy izany no ratsy indrindra
I never walk.	tsy mandeha mihitsy aho
I never do that.	tsy manao izany mihitsy aho
There may be no other reason for this.	mety tsy hisy antony hafa aminizany
But we can't.	tsy afaka anefa izahay
You never know what you will get.	tsy fantatrao mihitsy izay ho azonao
I can't do that from here.	tsy afaka manao izany aho avy eto
This is not new.	tsy vaovao io
I became confused.	lasa very hevitra aho
If both get around.	raha samy mahazo eo ho eo
It’s really fun for people to have it.	tena mahafinaritra ny olona manana izany
But that is not what it is.	tsy inona anefa izany
He also knows the truth.	fantany ny marina koa
Someone else.	misy olona hafa
I'm not used to it.	tsy mahazatra aho
He is happy about it.	faly izy noho izany
Very good indeed.	tena tsara tokoa
This is not a problem.	tsy olana izao
Completely different.	hafa tanteraka
He couldn't think of anything.	tsy afaka nieritreritra na inona na inona izy
I always know my surroundings.	fantatro foana ny manodidina ahy
The person may have done the wrong thing.	diso asa angamba ilay olona
This is not very common.	tsy dia mahazatra loatra izany
This is where you should be.	eto no tokony hisy anao
See if you still like it.	jereo raha mbola tianao
First of all, the result is very simple.	voalohany indrindra ny vokatra dia tena tsotra
It’s a fun game.	lalao mahafinaritra izany
It’s really hard.	tena sarotra tokoa izany
It was as if he were someone else.	toy ny hoe olona hafa izy
So, the facts are not the real thing.	noho izany ny zavamisy dia tsy ny tena izy
We agree.	mitovy hevitra isika
But it’s worth the money.	saingy mendrika ny vola
Just great stuff.	zavatra lehibe fotsiny
We may come to that again.	mety ho tonga aminizany indray izahay
That was the most fun thing for him.	izany no zavatra nahafinaritra indrindra ho azy
But that became impossible.	lasa tsy azo atao anefa izany
It may be too little for some.	mety ho kely loatra ho anny sasany
You should already know that.	tokony efa fantatrao izany
I need to do that.	mila manao izany aho
It's very simple.	tena tsotra izany
It seems small.	toa kely izany
Works as intended.	miasa araka ny natao
We now have a car.	manana fiara izahay izao
It will never get rid of the problem.	tsy ho afaka aminny olana mihitsy izany
There is something wrong here.	misy zavatra tsy mety eto
He is very small.	kely tokoa izy
But he did nothing wrong.	tsy nanao ratsy anefa izy
He will be with you through difficult times.	ho eo aminao izy na aminny sarotra na aminny sarotra
No one is safe.	tsy misy olona azo antoka
I think it will be a good game.	heveriko fa ho lalao tsara izany
There was another way.	nisy lalana hafa koa
I had one on one.	nanana iray taminny iray aho
I know he is nowhere near me.	fantatro fa tsy misy akaiky ahy izy
So if he really died, it was their fault and not mine.	ka raha maty tokoa izy dia izy ireo no diso fa tsy ahy
None of this is real.	tsy misy aminireo no tena zavamisy
It was meant to be.	natao ho izy io
I was just thinking, you know.	nieritreritra fotsiny aho fantatrao
It has to be seen.	tsy maintsy ho hita izany
He is mine, not yours.	ahy izy fa tsy anao
Neither was a good choice.	samy tsy nisy safidy tsara
So we did.	dia nanao izany izahay
Not the biggest.	tsy ny lehibe indrindra
The latter seems to be a better way.	ny farany dia toa fomba tsara kokoa
They are old enough.	efa ampy taona izy ireo
It’s either us.	izy io na isika
There are a lot of things that can go wrong.	betsaka ny zavatra mety tsy mety
If we lose him, he is lost.	raha very azy isika dia very izy
He went and got the picture.	nandeha izy ary nahazo ny sary
Too much food.	be loatra ny sakafo
And then and one.	ary avy eo ary iray
Not too fast, though.	tsy haingana loatra anefa
Not much, anymore.	tsy dia betsaka intsony
We always have a great time.	manana fotoana mahafinaritra foana izahay
But in the end, it didn't make sense.	tsy nisy dikany anefa izany taminny farany
I love him too much.	tiako izy fa be loatra
There was nothing special about it.	tsy nisy zavatra manokana momba izany
She must be beautiful.	tsy maintsy tsara tarehy izy
That is true, of course.	marina tokoa izany mazava ho azy
I have been wrong before.	efa diso aho taloha
So, you can have a good time too.	noho izany afaka manana fotoana mahafinaritra koa ianao
First, real time.	voalohany fotoana tena izy
I don’t want to be with him.	tsy tiako ny miaraka aminy
He wanted her to be happy.	tiany ho faly izy
That's enough talk now.	ampy izay ny resaka izao
It’s really hard.	tena mafy tokoa
Make sure they know it !.	ataovy azo antoka fa fantany izany
I really know this person.	fantatro tokoa io olona io
And you’ve probably taken the hardest step.	ary angamba efa nanao ny dingana sarotra indrindra ianao
The harder, the better.	ny mafy kokoa ny tsara kokoa
But he could do it.	afaka nanao izany anefa izy
In fact, we have three of them.	raha ny marina dia manana telo aminizy ireo izahay
It's really not good.	tena tsy tsara izany
None of these things.	tsy misy aminireo zavatra ireo
But we can get started.	afaka manomboka anefa isika
And he is right.	ary marina izy
With or without.	misy na tsia
Both are probably true.	samy marina angamba
So, what exactly is new ?.	noho izany inona marina no vaovao
That is a sure word.	teny azo antoka izany
He also had many questions.	nanana fanontaniana be dia be koa izy
But there is something missing in it, even the fun.	saingy misy zavatra tsy ampy ao aminy eny fa na dia ny mahafinaritra aza
And it doesn’t get much better.	ary tsy tsara kokoa izany
It’s all a story.	tantara daholo izany rehetra izany
We will come soon.	ho avy tsy ho ela isika
Everything is clearer to you than anyone else.	mazava kokoa aminao ny zavadrehetra noho ny hafa
The weather is not good.	tsy tsara ny andro
All of these things are true.	marina ireo zavatra rehetra ireo
I went fast.	nandeha haingana aho
This is his favorite place.	io no toerana tiany indrindra
He gets good food.	mahazo sakafo tsara izy
Now that could be a problem.	ankehitriny dia mety ho olana izany
I need to be with him more.	mila miaraka aminy bebe kokoa aho
This is the usual way.	izany no fomba mahazatra
It’s always a process.	dingana foana izany
There is no more time.	tsy misy fotoana intsony
But what it is, it is not.	fa inona izany tsy izany
I see.	hitako
He is right, of course.	marina ny azy mazava ho azy
But that’s not all.	saingy tsy izao rehetra izao
It is from above.	avy any ambony izy io
Stupid stuff.	zavatra adala
Even if it’s bad, even if it’s really bad.	na dia ratsy aza izany na dia tena ratsy aza
I started from the very beginning.	nanomboka taminny voalohany indrindra aho
Maybe you’ll understand it better.	angamba ho azonao tsara kokoa izany
People are not like that.	tsy mba toy izany ny olona
It's easier.	mora kokoa izany
We made time for it.	nanao fotoana izahay momba izany
The same is true today.	toy izany koa ny olana ankehitriny
He loves me here.	tiany eto aho
So for sure if it works.	noho izany dia azo antoka fa raha miasa
There was something else.	nisy zavatra hafa hafa
But here is a better picture.	fa ity misy sary tsara kokoa
But that is not the case.	tsy izany anefa no tena marina
Yes, he saw them.	eny nahita azy ireo izy
Mine is different.	hafa ny ahy
It’s not that he is.	tsy hoe izy no izy
He didn't want to do that.	tsy te hanao izany izy
Sometimes it’s hard to find a word.	sarotra indraindray ny mahita teny iray
It seems clear to him.	toa mazava aminy izany
The problem is, he really loves her.	ny olana dia tena tia azy izy
None of me.	tsy misy ahy
Of course he knew.	mazava ho azy fa fantany
And here you are.	ary eto ianao izao
And here too.	ary eto koa
They may be close.	mety ho akaiky izy ireo
The first two are better options.	ny roa voalohany dia safidy tsara kokoa
Everything is very complicated.	sarotra be ny zavadrehetra
This is very important.	tena zavadehibe izany
He is very small.	tena kely izy
I really like it here.	tena tiako ny eto
You have to come.	tsy maintsy tonga ianao
Life is a bit hard.	somary sarotra ny fiainana
Mine came first.	ny ahy no tonga voalohany
He stayed like this with me.	nijanona toy izao tamiko izy
And found one.	ary nahita iray
Or maybe worse.	na mety ho ratsy kokoa
And so will you.	ary ho toy izany koa ianao
I have big ones and they need quick results.	manana lehibe aho ary mila vokatra haingana izy ireo
It doesn’t go the other way.	tsy mandeha aminny lalana hafa izany
That’s the first thing.	izany no zavatra voalohany
They are things.	zavatra izy ireo
He has a problem.	manana olana izy
But only one.	iray ihany anefa
It’s an easy life.	fiainana mora izany
Not so much right now but it’s already working.	tsy dia be loatra aminizao fotoana izao fa efa miasa
Or it might be simpler than that.	na mety ho tsotra kokoa noho izany aza
No, that's not a good picture.	tsia tsy sary tsara izany
It’s a good job if you can.	asa tsara izany raha azonao atao
But more than that, there must be.	saingy mihoatra noho izany tsy maintsy misy
I know you do.	fantatro fa manao izany ianao
This task is very difficult.	tena sarotra io asa io
But this is not much different.	tsy hafa be anefa ny eto
Then he looked at the others.	dia nijery ny hafa izy
You don't see me.	tsy mahita ahy ianao
I love men.	tiako ny lehilahy
Now, that seems very simple, and it’s not.	ankehitriny toa tsotra be izany ary tsy izany
Exactly as seen in the picture.	tena araka ny hita eo aminny sary
That’s everyone.	izany no olona rehetra
Well, fine.	eny ary tsara
It wasn’t always fun.	tsy nahafinaritra foana ilay izy
Not great, but better.	tsy lehibe fa tsara kokoa
Much, much less.	be kely kokoa
There was no woman without him.	tsy nisy vehivavy tsy teo aminy
There is no work either.	tsy misy asa koa
We needed to do something special.	nila nanao zavatra manokana izahay
I don't like him there.	tsy tiako any izy
A lot of people start things all the time.	betsaka ny olona manomboka zavatra aminny fotoana rehetra
One or two did.	iray na roa no nanao izany
I also found new foods.	nahita sakafo vaovao koa aho
No one saw him.	tsy nisy nahita azy
He was certainly not wrong.	azo antoka fa tsy diso izy
They also have to do two things more clearly.	tsy maintsy manao zavatra roa mazava kokoa koa izy ireo
He saw nothing.	tsy nahita na inona na inona izy
I never saw them.	tsy nahita azy ireo mihitsy aho
I think it’s that simple.	heveriko fa tsotra izany
He did well there.	nanao tsara izy teo
They are always together.	miaraka foana izy ireo
Good, but it needs to be bigger.	tsara fa mila lehibe kokoa
I am very easy to find.	tena mora hita aho
It may be selfish, but that’s the best you can do.	mety ho tia tena fa izany no tsara indrindra azonao atao
I will be there.	efa ho eo aho
I really like them.	tena tiako izy ireo
It will be a war.	ho ady izany
In fact, it should be easy to do.	raha ny marina dia tokony ho mora ny manao izany
A better place for us.	toerana tsara kokoa ho antsika
That could mean a lot.	mety hisy dikany lehibe izany
Thanks to some.	misaotra ny sasany
But for now, that is not possible.	saingy aminizao fotoana izao dia tsy azo atao izany
I really don’t see why.	tena tsy hitako izay antony
Because it’s different.	satria hafa izany
And there isn’t.	ary tsy misy izany
I will definitely do that.	azo antoka fa hanao izany aho
It should, but it may not.	tokony fa mety tsy
I want you to know.	tiako ho fantatrao
And the world said.	dia hoy izao tontolo izao
It was so quick to think about the future here.	haingana tokoa ny nieritreritra ny ho avy eto
They may also be different over time.	mety ho hafa koa izy ireo aminny fotoana
It is clear now.	mazava izao
So that idea just stopped.	ka io hevitra io dia nijanona fotsiny
He loves these people.	tiany ireo olona ireo
Maybe not so long ago.	angamba tsy ela akory izay
There is also enough time, you say.	ampy ihany koa ny fotoana hoy ianao
Make sure you follow them.	ataovy azo antoka fa manaraka azy ireo ianao
I seem to have gone too far.	toa lasa lavitra aho
And for now that is enough.	ary aminizao fotoana izao dia ampy izay
What to do when something goes wrong.	inona no atao rehefa misy zavatra tsy mety
Now he is no more.	ankehitriny dia tsy hita intsony izy
Not sure, but maybe.	tsy azo antoka fa angamba
You see a face, someone.	mahita tarehy ianao olona iray
He was wrong.	diso hevitra izy taminizany
That’s where he needs to hurry.	eo izy no mila haingana
Or as safe as ever.	na azo antoka toy ny taloha
She’s just beautiful.	tsara tarehy fotsiny izy
The future is now.	ny ho avy dia izao
He’s better than that, better than that.	tsara kokoa noho izany izy tsara kokoa noho izany
Two days, two nights.	roa andro roa alina
There was only one thing in the end.	zavatra iray ihany no nisy farany
No more than him.	tsy mihoatra noho izy
This is the former.	ity no teo aloha
But it’s worse for us.	saingy ratsy kokoa ho antsika izany
I am a big man.	lehilahy lehibe aho
It doesn’t make sense to me now.	tsy misy dikany amiko izany ankehitriny
Which can only come from him.	izay mety ho avy aminy ihany
It’s not like an event at all.	tsy toy ny hetsika mihitsy izany
He deserves to be better.	mendrika ho tsara kokoa izy
This is not a good choice.	tsy safidy tsara izany
This is still a long way off.	mbola lavitra ity
The same goes for everyone when it comes.	toy izany koa ny tsirairay rehefa tonga
It can’t be otherwise.	tsy mety ho raha tsy izany
You have told me that many times.	efa nilaza izany tamiko matetika ianao
He fought well at first.	nanao ady tsara izy taminny voalohany
He was very right, as if he were wrong.	tena marina izy toy ny tsy mety
They were there quickly.	haingana teo izy ireo
I couldn't look at him.	tsy afaka nijery azy aho
I would love to see that.	tiako ny mahita izany
Everyone came.	tonga ny rehetra
Yes, that is the best.	eny izany no tsara indrindra
Faster.	haingana kokoa
You just left.	vao lasa ianao
The problem is not him.	ny olana dia tsy izy
It will not be enough for everyone.	tsy ho ampy ho anny rehetra
It was there, but now it has gone even further.	teo izy io fa lasa lavitra kokoa izao
I was really there.	tena tao aho
It’s not all a matter of whether or not.	tsy olana rehetra izany na tsia
He is also dead.	efa maty koa izy
He's gone, he's gone.	lasa izy lasa izy
These are big steps.	dingana lehibe ireo
They are all there and true.	misy sy marina daholo
It’s possible, it’s easy.	azo atao izany mora
However, almost everyone got it right.	na izany aza saika nahazo tsara daholo ny rehetra
Of course he can't.	mazava ho azy fa tsy afaka izy
I thank them all.	misaotra azy rehetra aho
What a real story.	inona no tena tantara
It doesn’t make much sense.	tsy dia misy dikany loatra izany
There is enough money.	ampy ny vola any
I think that’s a good thing.	heveriko fa zavatra tsara izany
It’s all with them or not.	miaraka aminizy ireo izany rehetra izany na tsia
Of course it will be different.	mazava ho azy fa ho hafa izany
In fact, he knew he was right.	raha ny marina fantany fa marina ny azy
Yes, we must love people.	eny tsy maintsy tia olona isika
I've been thinking about that too.	efa nieritreritra izany koa aho
But then again, it’s okay.	fa avy eo indray mety ihany
It’s well worth the money.	tena mendrika ny vola izany
But they are different.	samy hafa anefa ireo
That is, if they do anything.	izany hoe raha manao na inona na inona izy ireo
Of course he didn’t like it.	mazava ho azy fa tsy tiany izany
No one likes the process.	tsy misy olona tia ny dingana
All good news.	vaovao tsara rehetra
Best man.	lehilahy tsara indrindra
You were then.	ianao taminizany
The idea was fun.	nahafinaritra ilay hevitra
You know some parts.	fantatrao ny ampahany sasany
But that’s something.	saingy zavatra izany
Yes, it has been around for a long time.	eny efa ela no nisy azy io
When it is found not to be found.	rehefa hita fa tsy hita
This person is very unusual and full of life.	tena tsy mahazatra sy feno fiainana io olona io
The first day was the hardest.	ny andro voalohany no sarotra indrindra
I have never seen a picture like this.	mbola tsy nahita sary toy izao aho
He thought so.	nieritreritra izany izy
I went downstairs.	nandeha tany ambany aho
This is very true.	tena marina tokoa izany
We can do better than that.	afaka manao tsara kokoa noho izany isika
They are on time.	anny fotoana izy ireo
You know what is to come.	fantatrao izay ho avy
But you don't love me.	fa tsy tia ahy ianao
It can't be like this.	tsy mety ho toy izao
Then they left again.	dia lasa indray izy ireo
He must be confused.	tsy maintsy ho very hevitra izy
There is no information about it.	tsy misy vaovao momba izany
Not him at all.	tsy izy mihitsy
Now, we are the same.	ankehitriny mitovy isika
But that is only part of it.	ampahany ihany anefa izany
If he likes it, he likes it.	raha tiany izany dia tiany
I have nothing more than that.	tsy manana na inona na inona aho mihoatra izany
This is good for everyone.	tsara ho anny rehetra izany
Women too.	vehivavy koa
It's so big, that's what it is.	tena lehibe ilay izy ka izay no izy
He could have told her.	afaka nilaza taminy izy
And all good.	ary izay rehetra tsara
We did that.	nanao izany izahay
What you can do from here.	izay azonao atao avy eto
The bad news is.	ny vaovao ratsy dia
But not this man.	fa tsy io lehilahy io
The house already has an existing part.	efa manana ampahany efa misy ilay trano
Not so long ago.	tsy ela izay
You don't have to thank me.	tsy mila misaotra ahy ianao
And after that, very easily.	ary afaka izany tena mora
Lots of other things, for sure, but not this one.	betsaka ny zavatra hafa azo antoka fa tsy ity iray ity
There are no two worlds.	tsy misy tontolo roa
There is no place around me to do that though.	tsy misy toerana eo aminny manodidina ahy hanao izany na izany aza
Not then.	tsy taminizany
They are not together.	tsy miaraka izy ireo
And looked at it.	ary nijery izany
She is a man woman.	izy no vehivavy lehilahy
It's a really nice place.	tena toerana mahafinaritra io
Not good for women her age.	tsy tsara ho anny vehivavy mitovy taona aminy
I don’t see the age anymore.	tsy hitako intsony ny taona
But in fact, you are not.	saingy raha ny marina tsy izany ianao
You are free again now.	afaka indray ianao izao
I think that's good.	heveriko fa tsara izany
But something was still missing.	mbola nisy zavatra tsy ampy anefa
And sometimes not.	ary indraindray tsy
But we had so much fun without you.	fa nahafinaritra be izahay tsy nisy anao
I have no choice.	tsy manana safidy aho
Then the man knew.	dia fantany ilay lehilahy
I didn’t look too much.	tsy dia nijery loatra aho
There was something else about him.	nisy zavatra hafa taminy
Either way, it’s the same.	na izany na tsy izany dia toy izany ihany
No one came to watch.	tsy nisy tonga nijery
We will be close.	ho eo akaiky eo isika
They are not the same in reality.	tsy mitovy ny zavamisy izy ireo
I’m not too happy that they were able to do that.	tsy dia faly loatra aho fa afaka nanao izany izy ireo
First, we don’t have enough money.	voalohany tsy ampy vola izahay
But if you do, you will know in the first place.	fa raha manao izany ianao dia ho fantatrao aminny voalohany
Now there are no people from these places.	ankehitriny dia tsy misy olona avy aminireo toerana ireo
In fact, we do the same.	raha ny marina dia manao izany koa izahay
He only wanted the house.	ny trano ihany no tiany
Not for any particular reason.	tsy noho ny antony manokana
He never looked around.	tsy nijery manodidina mihitsy izy
Maybe he made them.	angamba izy no nanao azy ireo
Not because we won the game.	tsy hoe satria nahazo ny lalao izahay
It could be easy.	mety ho mora izany
Although we don’t need it now.	na dia tsy mila izany aza isika ankehitriny
No, it really isn't.	tsia tena tsy izany
Often it didn’t make sense.	matetika dia tsy nisy dikany izany
Maybe I’m doing something wrong.	angamba manao zavatra tsy mety aho
He makes a lot more money than we do.	mahazo vola be lavitra noho isika izy
This method is therefore difficult.	sarotra araka izany araka izany ity fomba ity
Nothing really.	tsy misy marina
I think we are like that.	heveriko fa toy izany isika
Then something goes wrong.	dia misy tsy mety
These wonderful times will come.	ho avy ireo fotoana mahafinaritra ireo
I am very happy about that.	tena faly aho noho izany
But here again, the reality is not simple.	saingy eto indray dia tsy tsotra ny zavamisy
Some of them are mine.	ny sasany aminizy ireo dia ahy
It could be one of them.	mety ho iray aminizy ireo izany
I was there.	tao aho
It’s hard.	sarotra izany
I want to see this man.	tiako ho hita io lehilahy io
Bad choice.	safidy ratsy
Next time will be tough.	ho sarotra ny fotoana manaraka
In general, this was not the case.	aminny ankapobeny dia tsy nisy izany
And not just for himself.	ary tsy ho anny tenany ihany
It’s also very difficult.	sarotra be ihany koa
It’s nothing, but it’s not something either.	tsy inona izany fa tsy zavatra koa
The last time was the worst.	ny fotoana farany no ratsy indrindra
I think we can do better.	heveriko fa afaka manao zavatra tsara kokoa isika
Far faster.	haingana lavitra
You will be free.	ho afaka ianao
The time is always now.	ny fotoana dia izao foana
Thanks for that.	misaotra noho izany
In fact, it didn’t exist.	raha ny marina dia tsy nisy izany
I should have known.	tokony ho fantatro
But the idea is this.	fa ny hevitra dia izao
I really like him, in fact.	tena tiako izy raha ny marina
That should be three.	tokony ho telo izany
But it still works.	saingy mbola miasa ihany
Not really.	tsy tena
I can follow him.	afaka manaraka azy aho
Someone did it.	nisy olona nanao izany
It should be simple enough.	tokony ho tsotra ampy
Sooner or later, money will be an issue.	na ho ela na ho haingana dia ho olana ny vola
You can’t be more than you already are.	tsy afaka ny ho mihoatra noho ny efa misy ianao
Women do it, and men do it.	ny vehivavy no manao izany ary ny lehilahy manao izany
You are a fast person, or not.	olona haingana ianao na tsia
This is not an easy task.	tsy asa mora izany
He always loved it.	tiany foana izany
No new stories.	tsy misy tantara vaovao
Not too much this year.	tsy dia betsaka loatra ity taona ity
Lots of ideas.	hevitra be dia be
I came up with two possible ideas.	nahita hevitra roa azo atao aho
It’s even worse.	mbola ratsy kokoa izany
Whatever, he has something about you.	na inona na inona misy zavatra iray momba anao izy
They still do.	mbola manao izany izy ireo
Not for men.	tsy ho anny lehilahy
So we work.	ka miasa izahay
All the time.	ny fotoana rehetra
That could be great.	mety ho lehibe izany
Sometimes even more.	indraindray aza mihoatra
It should take a day or two to do the work.	iray na roa andro no tokony hanao ny asa
We have that too.	manana izany koa izahay
I've seen it before.	efa hitako aloha
We are real people.	tena olona isika
And even now.	ary na dia izao aza
Now, not too much.	ankehitriny tsy dia be loatra
This is the lowest.	ity dia ambany indrindra
And he stood there.	dia nijanona teo izy
I love them and I love having them.	tiako izy ireo ary tiako ny manana azy ireo
Almost nothing started.	saika tsy nisy na inona na inona no nanomboka
I love it, man.	tiako ilay izy lehilahy
We are important.	zavadehibe isika
It is very easy to do.	tena mora ny manao izany
I just need something.	mila zavatra fotsiny aho
The idea, however, may be less than it seems.	ny hevitra na izany aza dia mety ho kely kokoa noho ny hita
Or it will be found to be inadequate.	na ho hita ho tsy ampy
He doesn’t like it, he doesn’t need it.	tsy tiany izany tsy ilaina azy izany
Very easy for me.	tena mora amiko
I know you didn't do anything wrong.	fantatro fa tsy nanao ratsy ianao
It really makes sense to me now.	tena misy dikany amiko izany ankehitriny
Good looking people too.	olona tsara mijery koa
You will be easy.	ho mora ianao
I find it not bad.	hitako fa tsy ratsy
And there, his, and they.	ary eo ny azy ary izy ireo
Maybe too good.	tsara loatra angamba
If he doesn’t come, we watch.	raha tsy tonga izy dia mijery izahay
It's too true.	marina loatra ilay izy
It wasn’t too fun.	tsy dia nahafinaritra loatra
It was fun to do.	nahafinaritra ny nanao izany
They look closely.	mijery akaiky izy ireo
He just doesn’t need me without words.	izy ihany no tsy mila ahy raha tsy misy ny teny
But more importantly it should be bigger than life.	fa ny tena zavadehibe dia tokony ho lehibe kokoa noho ny fiainana
He knows what we are.	fantany hoe inona isika
This is really bad.	tena ratsy tokoa izany
But many do.	betsaka anefa no manao izany
All of us.	isika rehetra
Or you already know the truth.	na efa fantatrao ny marina
That was only two years ago.	vao roa taona lasa izay izany
I think that's enough.	heveriko fa ampy izay
The former did not.	ny teo aloha dia tsy nanao izany
It used to be beautiful.	tena tsara tarehy izany taloha
He should be right now.	tokony ho aminizao fotoana izao izy
This can be done very easily.	azo atao mora be izany
I need food.	mila sakafo aho
It's not up to me to do anything.	tsy ahy ny manao zavatra
It’s all part of it.	ampahany daholo izany
I was happy about that.	faly aho taminizany
On a lot of land.	eo aminny tany be
He enjoyed things like that.	nahafinaritra azy ny zavatra toy izany
I still love a lot about it.	mbola tia zavatra maro momba izany
He’s really gone.	tena lasa izy
Either way, it was fun.	na izany na tsy izany dia nahafinaritra izany
It works well, but it’s really bad.	miasa tsara izy io saingy tena ratsy
He told me he loved me.	nilaza tamiko izy fa tia ahy
Thanks for watching me.	misaotra nijery ahy
Now, a whole new person is coming.	ankehitriny misy olona vaovao tanteraka tonga
This is more common in women.	matetika kokoa aminny vehivavy izany
This is where we are.	izany no toerana misy antsika
She is so beautiful.	tena tsara tarehy tokoa izy
It's not that he's real.	tsy hoe izy no tena izy
I don’t know what it is.	tsy fantatro hoe inona izany
He is with everyone.	miaraka aminny olona rehetra izy
Great story.	tantara mahafinaritra
It’s all up front.	eo aloha daholo izany
And finally, it came to the unseen.	ary farany tonga tao aminny zavatra tsy hita
Check this out.	jereo ity
They didn’t have it.	tsy nanana izany izy ireo
That alone is enough.	izany mihitsy dia ampy
He looked around.	nijery manodidina azy izy
And that he loves me.	ary hoe tia ahy izy
And for good reason, too.	ary noho ny antony tsara ihany koa
I want to be a better person.	te ho olona tsara kokoa aho
We almost died.	saika maty izahay
But it's a bad job.	asa ratsy anefa
In a good way.	aminny fomba tsara
Don’t do too much.	aza manao be loatra
It’s a difficult place.	toerana sarotra izany
Of course he is.	mazava ho azy fa izy
Either way in the end, you’ll know.	na izany na tsy izany aminny farany ho fantatrao
Otherwise, they can do whatever they want on their own.	raha tsy izany dia afaka manao izay tiany atao manokana izy ireo
I didn't need him.	tsy nila azy aho
The conversation is different.	hafa ny resaka
And for you.	ary ho anao
You already get it.	efa azonao izany
It went very fast.	nandeha haingana be izany
For him, life is hard work.	ho azy dia asa mafy ny fiainana
Ho ho, he knew exactly what was to come.	ho ho fantany tsara izay ho avy
There is nothing about it, not right now.	tsy misy na inona na inona momba izany tsy aminizao fotoana izao
I know now that it was once and not if.	fantatro izao fa indray mandeha izany fa tsy raha
Or in the same place.	na any aminny toerana mitovy
New to the game as well.	vaovao aminny lalao koa
However, the man died.	maty ihany anefa ilay lehilahy
I think one thing is clear.	heveriko fa misy zavatra iray mazava tsara
He was always there for her.	teo foana ho azy izy
But not close.	tsy akaiky anefa
For him, however, age is a problem.	ho azy anefa dia olana ny taona
No, much worse than that.	tsia ratsy lavitra noho izany
They got me through everything.	nahazo ahy taminny zavadrehetra izy ireo
That could not be true.	tsy mety ho marina izany
I went on a short trip.	nandeha dia kely aho
Need to start again, start anew.	mila manomboka indray manomboka vaovao
And it almost works.	ary saika miasa izany
The next day was a big day.	ny andro manaraka dia andro lehibe
Otherwise, however, he has no idea.	raha tsy izany anefa dia tsy manana hevitra izy
It’s just not that simple.	tsy tsotra fotsiny izany
It goes well.	mandeha tsara izy io
Sounds like a good idea.	toa hevitra tsara
He did not know the car.	tsy fantany ilay fiara
Time and place.	ny fotoana sy ny toerana
And that is life itself.	ary izany no fiainana mihitsy
Not enough ideas.	tsy ampy ny hevitra
But sometimes you need it.	saingy indraindray mila izany ianao
Surely you will not be like that.	azo antoka fa tsy ho toy izany ianao
But that's all.	fa izay ihany
It will not be lost.	tsy ho very izy io
Clear picture.	sary mazava
Nothing was done.	tsy nisy na inona na inona natao
Although it is difficult.	na dia sarotra aza izany
The previous game was a close option.	ny lalao teo aloha dia safidy akaiky
He never existed and was not a real person.	tsy nisy mihitsy izy ary tsy tena olona
But the latter is for sure.	saingy ity farany ity dia azo antoka
But this is not the only story.	tsy io ihany anefa no tantara
But he goes.	saingy mandeha izy
The action, however, was completely meaningless.	ny hetsika anefa dia tsy nisy dikany mihitsy

But in fact, it’s crazy.	fa raha ny tena marina dia adala izany

And they don’t even know it.	ary tsy fantany akory izany
Sure it can.	azo antoka fa afaka izany

We need to make sure they are.	mila mahazo antoka isika fa izy ireo
I’m happy with everything here.	faly aho aminny zavadrehetra eto
But today, that is certainly true.	saingy aminizao andro izao dia azo antoka fa marina izany

It became something else.	lasa zavatra hafa ilay izy
You can't do that to me.	tsy afaka manao izany amiko ianao
We didn’t make a good choice.	tsy nanao safidy tsara izahay
He knew there was a problem.	fantany fa nisy olana
He couldn't think like that.	tsy afaka nieritreritra toy izany izy
They want to do what is right.	te hanao ny tsara izy ireo
So he needed more cars.	noho izany dia nila fiara bebe kokoa izy
I have a place sometimes but not always.	manana toerana aho indraindray fa tsy foana
Past, present, future.	taloha ankehitriny ho avy
We have a choice.	manana safidy izahay
I couldn’t be happier.	tsy afaka ny ho faly kokoa aho
We must be very clear on that.	tsy maintsy mazava tsara isika aminizany
To say yes, yes, and yes again.	ny hoe eny eny ary eny indray
Very nice to see you.	tena faly mahita anao
They saw nothing.	tsy nahita na inona na inona izy ireo
Not really, actually.	tsy tena raha ny marina
It was fun too.	nahafinaritra koa izany
But she is the most beautiful to you.	fa izy no tsara tarehy indrindra aminao
Either way, there is no time.	na izany na tsy izany dia tsy misy fotoana
It is not ours.	tsy antsika izany
But the story goes much further than that.	saingy mihoatra lavitra noho izany ny tantara
You don’t have to look at me like that.	tsy mila mijery ahy toy izany ianao
Doing something for.	manao zavatra ho
It’s a matter of face for him.	resaka tarehy ho azy izany
At best, it’s not clear.	raha ny tsara indrindra dia tsy mazava ilay izy
If he hadn't already done so.	raha mbola tsy nanao izany izy
Not in the end.	tsy aminny farany
It has become commonplace.	lasa mahazatra izany
I could have done so much more.	afaka nanao zavatra betsaka kokoa aho
He wants to make it safer for everyone.	te hanao izany ho azo antoka kokoa ho anny rehetra izy
This is not where I am.	tsy ity ny toerana misy ahy
And that’s a big, big problem.	ary olana lehibe sy lehibe izany
But he is not here yet.	mbola tsy eto anefa izy
It was no longer with me.	tsy nisy ahy intsony izany
It will always be something.	ho lasa zavatra foana izy
If they can, fine.	raha afaka izy ireo dia tsara
That is what really matters.	izany tokoa no tena zavadehibe
Everything works again.	miasa indray ny zavadrehetra
But it’s not about you.	fa tsy momba anao
I enjoyed that part.	nahafinaritra ahy io ampahany io
But about that.	saingy ny momba izany
So these are a bit small.	ka ireo dia somary kely
Then we left.	dia lasa izahay
Some things are not right in it.	ny zavatra sasany dia tsy mety ao anatiny
Still, it looks good.	na izany aza dia toa tsara izany
Only one thing.	zavatra iray ihany
He has never had a woman do that.	mbola tsy nisy vehivavy nanao izany mihitsy izy
But it is only a choice.	safidy ihany anefa izany
It all seemed real.	toa tena nisy izany rehetra izany
We haven’t seen that game yet.	mbola tsy nahita anio lalao io izahay
For many things.	ho anny zavatra maro
The specific action was meaningless.	tsy nisy dikany ny hetsika manokana
You have to go see people.	tsy maintsy mandeha mijery olona ianao
But these stories are not entirely wrong.	tsy diso tanteraka anefa ireo tantara ireo
This is really crazy.	tena adala tokoa izany
He is mine.	izy no ahy
Sometimes it is even true.	marina mihitsy aza indraindray
It was really fun to watch.	tena nahafinaritra ny nijery azy
I do this and that, sometimes.	manao izao sy izao aho indraindray
He is his, and his alone.	azy izy ary azy irery
It was not meant for them.	tsy natao ho azy ireo izany
There was nothing there.	tsy nisy na inona na inona tany
As everyone knows, this is true.	araka ny fantany rehetra dia marina izany
But it can be many things.	mety ho zavatra maro anefa
We didn’t think of that for you.	tsy nieritreritra izany ho anao izahay
For life in general.	ho aminny fiainana aminny ankapobeny
Just be with me then.	miaraka amiko fotsiny ary
The or the, the or the.	ny na ny ny na ny
Both are already grown up.	efa lehibe ireo roa ireo
He has to do something.	tokony hanao zavatra izy
She’s really fun.	tena mahafinaritra izy
It needed to be done.	nila nanao izany
This is no small thing.	tsy zavatra kely izany
This guy is tough.	mafy ity lehilahy ity
He did not look at them.	tsy nijery azy ireo izy
All this is necessary for the final result.	izany rehetra izany dia ilaina ho anny vokatra farany
You will know that.	ho fantatrao izany
But it’s just beginning.	saingy vao manomboka izany
Works well here.	miasa tsara eto
I think he’s good for it.	heveriko fa tsara ho azy izy
Yes we are.	eny ary isika
So this could be a good time.	koa mety ho fotoana tsara izany
Not good enough.	tsy ampy tsara
I can't see him very well.	tsy hitako tsara izy
Ka said.	hoy i ka
They have become completely insane.	lasa adala tanteraka izy ireo
A little faster.	haingana kely
We are two.	roa izahay
He is really dead.	tena maty izy
Of course, this is not very simple.	mazava ho azy fa tsy tena tsotra izany
It’s too much, too fast.	be loatra izany haingana loatra
But you are gone now.	fa lasa ianao izao
A little bit more, more on this earth.	somary kely dia kely kokoa bebe kokoa aminity tany ity
I could do it now.	afaka nanao izany aho izao
It is very personal and real.	tena manokana sy tena izy io
He had to do something special.	tsy maintsy nanao zavatra manokana izy
He is, however, very small.	izy anefa dia tena kely
They do a good job.	manao asa tsara izy ireo
But that is what gets lost.	fa izay no lasa very
He saw a game again.	nahita lalao indray izy
Everything is gone.	lasa ny zavadrehetra
The big one is a completely different story.	ny lehibe dia tantara hafa tanteraka
You can do whatever you want with your own.	afaka manao izay tianao aminny anao ianao
We have to be sure.	tsy maintsy mahazo antoka isika
But he didn’t say, not yet.	saingy tsy nilaza izy tsy mbola
You can't.	tsy azonao atao
I was really crazy about everything.	tena adala aho taminny zavadrehetra
The place suits me.	mety amiko ilay toerana
It’s like he’s making time.	toy ny hoe manao fotoana izy
He is walking now.	mandeha izy izao
They do not know.	tsy fantany ireo
Whether male or female.	na lehilahy na vehivavy
Even his.	na ny azy aza
It could be a problem.	mety ho olana
He no longer looked at them.	tsy nijery azy ireo intsony izy
It all really started.	tena nanomboka izany rehetra izany
Someone else stopped to watch.	nisy olona hafa nijanona nijery
Of course he did.	mazava ho azy fa izy tokoa
In many ways, that makes sense.	aminny fomba maro dia misy dikany izany
Of course, better than the last.	mazava ho azy fa tsara kokoa noho ny farany
He was in another world.	tany aminny tontolo hafa izy
But that will never happen again.	tsy ho toy izany intsony anefa
Others have had it.	ny hafa efa nanana izany
Thank you women like you.	misaotra ny vehivavy toa anao
He is already a man.	efa lehilahy izy
I don’t want it to be bad.	tsy tiako ho ratsy izany
The fact is that this is where we are.	ny zavamisy dia izao no misy antsika
There are many other places that need it as well.	misy toerana maro hafa mila izany koa
I needed a little time.	nila fotoana kely aho
This woman is nothing but a problem.	tsy inona io vehivavy io fa olana
This is the real home for us.	izany no tena trano ho antsika
Which doesn’t make sense to me.	izay tsy misy dikany amiko
Apparently none.	toa tsy misy
And the next, and the next.	ary ny manaraka ary ny manaraka
You make everyone.	ianao no manao ny olona rehetra
He didn't seem to see anything.	toa tsy nahita na inona na inona izy
All of these are good.	tsara daholo ireo rehetra ireo
They want to come here too.	te ho tonga eto koa izy ireo
It just made sense.	nisy dikany ihany izany
It’s not the same at all.	tsy mitovy mihitsy izany
Upstairs, everything goes.	any ambony mandeha ny zavatra rehetra
He hadn’t thought too far.	tsy mbola nieritreritra lavitra be izy
But all is well.	fa tsara daholo
The conversation itself is meaningless.	ny resaka mihitsy dia tsy misy dikany
I really know about him.	tena fantatro ny momba azy
I don't know any of these people.	tsy fantatro na iray aza aminireo olona ireo
Yes you are.	eny ianao dia izany
It will be great.	ho lehibe tokoa izany
It’s hard to say.	sarotra ny nilaza izany
But this is another story.	tantara hafa anefa ity
He is not following you.	tsy manaraka anao izy
She has become too big to be beautiful.	lasa lehibe loatra izy ka tsy tokony ho tsara tarehy
It is not clear that it is enough.	tsy mazava ilay izy fa ampy
He had to do it, he always did.	tsy maintsy nanao izany izy nanao izany foana
I know he did.	fantatro fa nanao izany izy
It doesn’t make sense to him.	tsy misy dikany aminy izany
This is generally wrong.	diso izany aminny ankapobeny
I want you to know him.	tiako ho fantatrao izy
Died of his own accord.	maty ho azy
Two years for such a product.	roa taona ho anny vokatra toy izany
You will be happy to make the trip.	ho faly ianao nanao ilay dia
The result is there.	ny vokatra dia ao
To be sure, they are all bad.	mba azo antoka fa ratsy daholo izy ireo
I don’t really know what, but more.	tsy tena fantatro hoe inona fa bebe kokoa
I think that’s why.	heveriko fa izany no antony
A time when everything went wrong.	fotoana izay tsy mety ny zavadrehetra
No, no, that’s important.	tsia tsia zavadehibe izany
That is not the story.	tsy izany no tantara
You are different.	hafa ianao
We need a decent life.	mila fiainana mendrika isika
We don’t have a special war.	tsy manana ady manokana isika
I am very selfish.	tena tia tena aho
This part is a good fit.	mety tsara io ampahany io
If you don’t see it alone, it’s too bad.	raha tsy mahita azy irery ianao dia ratsy loatra
This is the safest thing to do.	io no zavatra azo antoka indrindra atao
No one walks alone.	tsy misy mandeha irery
It’s like you’re the only one.	toy ny hoe ianao ihany
It has to.	tsy maintsy izany
We’ve had it before, and lost it.	efa nanana izany izahay taloha ary very
It's not as it should be.	tsy araka ny tokony ho izy izany
But there is something better than nothing.	saingy misy zavatra tsara kokoa noho ny tsy misy
But this is not a normal day for me.	tsy andro mahazatra ahy anefa izany
He did it to me.	izy no nanao izany tamiko
It never seemed to happen.	toy ny tsy nisy mihitsy izany
There is also an advance.	misy aloha koa
Still no face.	mbola tsy misy tarehy anefa
There should be no more war.	tsy tokony hisy ady intsony
But it’s worth doing, for sure !.	fa mendrika ny manao izany azo antoka
He just knew he needed one.	fantany fotsiny fa mila iray izy
There are too many of us.	betsaka loatra ny anay
But he came.	fa izy no tonga
There, of course.	eo mazava ho azy
He never did.	tsy nanao izany mihitsy izy
Then, for the last time, he stopped.	avy eo taminny fotoana farany dia nijanona izy
No, that's fun.	tsia mahafinaritra izany
It became bigger.	lasa lehibe kokoa
These are facts.	zavamisy ireo
Women did not do so.	tsy nanao toy izany ny vehivavy
They also want to be in history.	te ho eo aminny tantara koa izy ireo
He loves them all.	tiany daholo izy ireo
This thing is fun.	mahafinaritra ity zavatra ity
He came right away.	tonga avy hatrany izy
You didn't see anything.	tsy nahita na inona na inona ianao
But I didn’t think anything about it at the time.	saingy tsy nieritreritra na inona na inona momba izany aho taminizany fotoana izany
It's really hard, man.	tena sarotra ilay izy lehilahy
It’s a game about the future.	lalao momba ny ho avy io
Both are still here.	samy mbola eto
But this option is also a problem.	olana ihany koa anefa io safidy io
We were happy to get it.	faly izahay nahazo izany
Words like that.	teny toy izany
The smaller the product, the better.	ny kely kokoa ny vokatra ny tsara kokoa
He really knows now.	tena fantany izao
But he has not come yet.	tsy mbola tonga anefa izy
He really existed more than you.	tena nisy kokoa noho ianao izy
But it turns out that it’s also not fair to be fun.	saingy hita fa tsy mety koa ny hoe mahafinaritra
But he did not stop.	tsy nijanona anefa izy
So, just do yours.	noho izany ataovy fotsiny ny anao
Now he could see something, but nothing.	ankehitriny dia afaka nahita zavatra izy fa tsy inona
I often thought of him.	nieritreritra azy matetika aho
I am new to these things.	vaovao aminireo zavatra ireo aho
It doesn’t seem to make much sense.	toa tsy misy dikany loatra izany
We will do it if at least one dies.	hanao izany isika raha kely indrindra no maty
Become a man.	lasa lehilahy
Which, he knew they were now.	izay fantany fa izy ireo izao
He never had a car.	tsy nanana fiara mihitsy izy
There are too many of us now.	be loatra isika izao
Yes, hope so too.	eny manantena koa
Enough time.	ampy izay ny fotoana
He is good to you.	tsara aminao izy
Easy and hard.	mora sy sarotra
Some are.	ny sasany dia
I came inside.	tonga tao anatiny aho
But he is not very good.	tsy dia tsara loatra anefa izy
Here is another reason as well.	ity misy antony hafa koa
He looked at me.	nijery ahy izy
It should be a fight.	tokony ho ady izany
And yes it’s fun.	ary eny mahafinaritra
Life is whatever you want.	ny fiainana dia na inona na inona tianao
It's not too bad.	tsy dia ratsy loatra ilay izy
He has always been like that.	efa toy izany foana izy
Same but not the same.	mitovy fa tsy mitovy
This, too, is meaningless.	izany koa dia tsy misy dikany
That’s the next important thing.	izany no zavadehibe manaraka
It doesn’t deserve to be one of them.	tsy mendrika ny ho iray aminizy ireo izany
I hope you understand.	manantena aho fa azonao
In the next game, there is still no action.	aminny lalao manaraka mbola tsy misy hetsika
He loves you.	tia anao izy
The latter is probably the worst, for him.	ny farany angamba no ratsy indrindra ho azy
At first it acted as if everything was the same.	taminny voalohany dia nanao toy ny hoe mitovy daholo ny zavadrehetra
But in small parts.	fa aminny ampahany kely
Some will be lost.	ho very ny sasany
He didn’t want to make that talk.	tsy te hanao io resaka io izy
This is very hard at times.	tena mafy izany indraindray
They had everything.	nanana ny zavadrehetra izy ireo
I have no end.	tsy misy farany aho
It is also a place of trouble.	toerana misy olana koa izy io
Now, enough of the questions.	ankehitriny ampy ny fanontaniana
It can always happen.	mety hisy foana izany
Not my favorite.	tsy ny tiako indrindra
So, some of them have to be done, in fact.	noho izany ny sasany aminizy ireo dia tsy maintsy atao raha ny marina
I think that’s better.	heveriko fa tsara kokoa izany
That can be a really fun thing at times.	mety ho zavatra tena mahafinaritra izany indraindray
He only got a bit of one.	somary iray ihany no nahazo azy
He’s good but not so good.	tsara izy fa tsy dia tsara loatra
Thanks to him for coming to do that.	misaotra azy tonga nanao izany
I know the other man.	fantatro ilay lehilahy hafa
Anyway, right now.	na izany na tsy izany aminizao fotoana izao
He did not come to her.	tsy tonga tany aminy izy
The world was dead to him.	efa maty taminy izao tontolo izao
Nothing in the universe can exist by itself.	tsy misy na inona na inona eto aminizao rehetra izao afaka hisy ho azy irery
Glad the work is going well.	faly fa mandeha tsara ny asa
Very good, check it out.	tsara be jereo izany
And so it is.	ary toy izany koa izy
I think the big problem is housing.	heveriko fa ny olana lehibe dia ny trano
The man did not look that way.	tsy nijery anio lalana io ilay lehilahy
The situation is very different, he said.	hafa mihitsy ny zavamisy hoy izy
The timing is perfect for me.	tena mety amiko ny fotoana
We could be.	mety ho isika
There is nothing in it either.	tsy misy na inona na inona ao anatiny koa
Yes I had.	eny nanana
Yes, it is work.	eny asa izany
But that is not the point.	tsy izany anefa no zavadehibe
This woman is crazy.	adala ity vehivavy ity
They have a private life.	manana fiainana manokana izy ireo
I find it a lot of fun.	hitako fa mahafinaritra be izany
But that is where we are again.	fa izay indray no misy antsika
But, overall, it was a tough day.	saingy aminny ankapobeny dia andro sarotra izany
Completely and utterly wrong.	diso tanteraka sy tanteraka
It might be fun for him.	mety ho mahafinaritra azy izany
I don't even know the woman.	tsy fantatro akory ilay vehivavy
The house was full of them.	feno azy ireo ny trano
I want to be him.	te ho lasa azy aho
This will have to be seen once.	izany dia tsy maintsy ho hita indray mandeha
Now, this may be the first picture.	ankehitriny ity dia mety ho sary voalohany
He may have been confused.	very hevitra angamba izy
A very important part.	ampahany tena lehibe
This world is not mine and certainly not yours.	tsy ahy io tontolo io ary azo antoka fa tsy anao
Looks like the latter.	toa ity farany ity
He is great.	lehibe izy
But maybe.	fa mety
I think that’s a good conversation.	heveriko fa resaka tsara izany
There was nothing, it seemed to die.	tsy nisy na inona na inona toa maty
Little time.	kely ny fotoana
True, and that is the first problem.	marina ary izany no olana voalohany
That won't be a problem.	tsy hisy olana izany
It certainly made sense.	azo antoka fa nisy dikany izany
In this house.	aminity trano ity
But that’s not the worst.	saingy tsy izany no ratsy indrindra
Not very good.	tsy dia tsara
Really love him.	tena tia azy
But this is only partially true.	saingy aminny ampahany ihany no marina izany
We really almost got it.	tena saika nahazo izany izahay
We are so ugly.	tena ratsy tarehy tokoa izahay
In fact, it is not.	raha ny marina dia tsy izany no izy
I don’t have and never will.	tsy manana ary tsy hanao izany mihitsy
The road is no more.	tsy misy intsony ny lalana
Which doesn’t make sense either.	izay tsy misy dikany koa
When you get it, you get it.	rehefa azonao dia azonao
I actually had one.	tena nanana iray aho
It seems to exist.	toa hita fa misy izany
I am not at all happy with this event.	tsy faly mihitsy aho aminity hetsika ity
But it wasn't much fun.	tsy dia nahafinaritra anefa izany
I can start anew.	afaka manomboka vaovao aho
I'm better.	tsara kokoa aho
Doing and not doing can be different.	mety ho samy hafa ny manao sy ny tsy manao
They were very happy about it.	tena faly taminizany izy ireo
What a thing.	inona no zavatra
It’s a little better now, they said.	somary tsara kokoa izao hoy izy ireo
It is also difficult.	sarotra ihany koa izany
I like easy things.	tiako ny zavatra mora
I was just there for him and that was it.	teo fotsiny ho azy aho ary izay ihany
Not two people together.	tsy olona roa no miaraka
They haven’t gone far, or for a long time.	tsy lasa lavitra izy ireo na efa ela
To me, it didn’t really happen.	amiko dia tsy tena nisy izany
This past year has been very difficult for me.	tena mafy tamiko ity taona lasa ity
He doesn't like her.	tsy tiany izy
Action is needed.	ilaina ny hetsika
But he needed more.	nila bebe kokoa anefa izy
I think it will be for us.	heveriko fa ho antsika izany
Two days, three days, it’s hard to say.	roa andro telo andro sarotra ny nilaza izany
It was almost a word, but not real.	saika teny ihany ilay izy fa tsy tena
A little something.	zavatra kely
The real problem is not that person.	ny tena olana dia tsy io olona io
Not that they had much.	tsy hoe nanana be izy ireo
They are gone.	efa lasa izy ireo
Some good ideas.	hevitra tsara sasany
Time is everything, however.	ny fotoana dia ny zavadrehetra na izany aza
It's not very accurate.	tsy dia marina loatra ilay izy
No one was too fond.	tsy nisy olona tia loatra
That sounds crazy.	toa adala izany
Life is not like that.	tsy toy izany ny fiainana
Of course not.	mazava ho azy fa tsy izany mihitsy
I am with this beautiful woman.	miaraka aminity vehivavy tsara tarehy ity aho
It was not meant to be.	tsy natao ho izany
It’s good that it’s easier but not harder.	tsara raha mora kokoa izany fa tsy sarotra
It was not fun.	tsy nahafinaritra izany
No one wanted to do anything at all.	tsy nisy te hanao na inona na inona mihitsy
Money is time.	ny vola no fotoana
What else is he alone again.	inona koa no izy irery indray
It’s great, we really want to do it.	lehibe izy io tena te hanao izany izahay
It’s not that there’s anything unfamiliar to you.	tsy hoe misy zavatra tsy mahazatra anao
I didn't see any.	tsy nahita aho na iray aza
There was nothing special anymore.	tsy nisy zavatra manokana intsony
Do this action.	ataovy ity hetsika ity
I went too far.	lasa lavitra aho
We all have to start here and now.	tsy maintsy manomboka eto sy izao isika rehetra
It looks so much fun.	toa mahafinaritra be ilay izy
He looked up.	nijery izy
Or the.	na koa ny
He is dead.	efa maty izy
As long as he doesn't follow us.	raha mbola tsy manaraka antsika izy
The past is gone and the future is yet to come.	lasa ny lasa ary mbola ho avy ny ho avy
It is not easy for him.	tsy mora aminy izany
No, you already have it.	tsia efa manana izany ianao
I think it’s good to look at yourself first.	heveriko fa tsara ny mijery ny tena aloha
This is not the first time either.	tsy vao voalohany koa
Maybe you just got bad news or something.	angamba ianao vao nahazo vaovao ratsy na zavatra hafa
It was in everything, upstairs.	teo aminny zavadrehetra izany tany ambony
I need something simple that just works.	mila zavatra tsotra izay miasa fotsiny aho
There is a real problem here.	tena misy olana eto
They are probably the big three.	izy ireo angamba no telo lehibe
He still is.	mbola izy koa
But not all the time.	saingy tsy aminny fotoana rehetra
Too often, it’s not.	matetika loatra tsy izany
That is everything in the universe.	izany no zavadrehetra eo aminizao rehetra izao
Sure, there are many more.	azo antoka fa misy maro hafa
Maybe he should have.	angamba izy no tokony ho nanana
It’s a great choice.	safidy lehibe izany
We are all one, one for all.	iray isika rehetra iray ho anny rehetra
Even if it doesn’t make sense now.	na dia tsy nisy dikany aza izany ankehitriny
Many in fact.	maro raha ny marina
Real story.	tena tantara
Maybe they are doing it wrong.	angamba diso izy ireo manao izany
You have a problem.	ianao no manana olana
Not the same job, but exactly the same.	tsy asa mitovy fa mitovy tanteraka
She loved him once.	tia azy indray mandeha izy
But not then.	fa tsy avy eo
Then he looked at the woman.	dia nijery ilay vehivavy izy
They are just full of evil.	feno ratsy fotsiny izy ireo
He didn’t know he knew it.	tsy fantany fa fantany izany
I have a house.	manana trano aho
What is closest.	inona no akaiky indrindra
It is important and has.	zavadehibe ary manana
The house was lovely.	nahafinaritra ny trano
He could have said anything to her, but it wasn’t.	afaka nilaza na inona na inona taminy izy saingy tsy izany
Yes, they are women.	eny vehivavy izy ireo
The work seems to be right.	toa marina ilay asa
You never love him.	tsy tia azy mihitsy ianao
No, it is not possible.	tsia tsy azo atao
Everything didn’t make much sense.	tsy dia nisy dikany loatra ny zavadrehetra
They are both wrong or right.	samy tsy mety na marina izy ireo
But he is not as usual.	tsy toy ny mahazatra mihitsy anefa izy
And then there was always the bad part.	ary avy eo dia nisy foana ny ampahany ratsy
Of course, this is true.	mazava ho azy fa tanteraka izany
But we will be better.	fa ho tsara kokoa isika
In fact, you have.	na ny marina dia manana ianao
But this may not be true, in general.	mety tsy marina anefa izany aminny ankapobeny
Sometimes something else.	indraindray zavatra hafa koa
Even here, there may be something unusual.	na dia eto aza dia mety misy zavatra tsy mahazatra
The fact is this.	ny zavamisy dia izao
People get.	olona mahazo
It also works as intended.	izany koa dia miasa araka ny natao
Samy.	samy
It doesn’t seem like it to me.	toa tsy mitovy amiko izany
At night.	aminny alina
He was confused and did not think.	very hevitra izy ka tsy nieritreritra
One said they could do nothing about it.	nilaza ny iray fa tsy afaka manao na inona na inona momba izany izy ireo
He certainly won't be here.	azo antoka fa tsy ho eto izy
You want to do well.	te hanao tsara ianao
The end is just gone.	ny farany vao lasa
They should do it right.	tokony hanao izany tsara izy ireo

Worth the good stuff.	mendrika ny zavatra tsara
If so, they would not be here.	raha izany no izy dia tsy ho eto izy ireo
It's just a story.	tantara fotsiny ilay izy
But we are never alone, not really.	saingy tsy irery mihitsy isika tsy tena
Bad news, bad.	vaovao ratsy ratsy
This must be done only once.	tsy maintsy atao indray mandeha ihany izany
Going to work.	mandeha miasa
The world.	izao tontolo izao

That's you.	izay ianao
I liked them.	nahafinaritra ahy izy ireo
It's here now.	tonga izao izany
The same is true of men.	toy izany koa ny lehilahy
Of course, that idea goes too far.	mazava ho azy fa lasa lavitra loatra io hevitra io
For many, food is the last resort.	ho anny maro ny sakafo no farany
We work here.	miasa eto izahay
It’s not just an option.	tsy safidy fotsiny izany
Yes, that's it.	eny izany ihany
You start to see it.	manomboka mahita izany ianao
But you will be wrong.	fa ho diso hevitra ianao
He was never wrong.	tsy diso mihitsy izy
He has something.	misy zavatra izy
He is completely crazy.	adala tanteraka izy
We started walking.	nanomboka nandeha izahay
We hope this is the end.	manantena izahay fa ity no farany
Like the same thing.	toy ny zavatra iray ihany
It’s so big and hard.	tena lehibe sy sarotra izany
Lots of good food.	be dia be ny sakafo tsara
Maybe it didn’t make sense.	tsy nisy dikany angamba izany
Of course there was.	mazava ho azy fa nisy izany
They often have a story.	matetika izy ireo dia manana tantara
It became his thing.	lasa zavatra azy izany
They are the same.	mitovy izy ireo
It could be the same here.	mety ho toy izany koa ny eto
Enough for the game.	ampy ho anny lalao
It’s hard to do that.	sarotra ny manao izany
You need it in the game.	mila izany ianao aminny lalao
It has the best location, very close to everything.	manana ny toerana tsara indrindra izy io tena akaiky ny zavadrehetra
It almost makes no sense.	saika tsy misy dikany izany
Because we are wonderful people.	satria olona mahafinaritra izahay
No, that's not right, he told himself.	tsia tsy mety izany hoy izy taminny tenany
Some questions may be difficult.	mety ho sarotra ny fanontaniana sasany
I love this car.	tiako io fiara io
It also seems possible.	toa azo atao koa izany
The more the merrier.	ny betsaka no tsara kokoa
So it wasn't his.	ka tsy azy ilay izy
Sometimes you can be the same way.	indraindray dia mety ho toy izany koa ianao
But it doesn’t make sense.	fa tsy misy dikany anefa
I didn’t know he was coming here.	tsy fantatro fa ho avy eto izy
He stopped.	nijanona izy
And he didn’t seem to.	ary toa tsy nanao izany izy
In fact, you do too.	raha ny marina ianao koa
But we can, and we really should do more.	saingy afaka ary tena tokony hanao bebe kokoa isika
And the people began to walk there.	dia nanomboka nandeha tany ny olona
Otherwise, it won’t happen.	raha tsy izany dia tsy hisy izany
They are men like us, no more.	lehilahy toa antsika izy ireo tsy misy intsony

If they didn’t, they went away.	raha tsy nanao izany izy ireo dia lasa nandeha
Times will be tough.	ho sarotra ny fotoana
No more than one.	tsy mety mihoatra ny iray
They are just part of the journey of life.	ampahany fotsiny aminny dia eo aminny fiainana izy ireo
But there had to be something about it as well.	saingy tsy maintsy nisy ihany koa ny momba izany
They are very selfish.	tena tia tena izy ireo
Apparently he did.	toa nanao izany izy
And here's why.	ary izao no antony
You are just the way.	ny fomba fotsiny ianao
Maybe today.	angamba anio ary
Of course, they are not the same.	mazava ho azy fa tsy mitovy izy ireo
I thank the easy people.	misaotra ny olona mora aho
It’s a small thing.	zavatra kely io
However, you are not far from the truth.	na izany aza tsy lavitra ny zavamisy ianao
It’s exactly the same.	tena mitovy tanteraka
One after the other.	iray manaraka ny iray
It was very small.	tena kely ilay izy
Don't do it again.	aza manao izany indray
They don’t do the work for you.	tsy manao ny asa ho anao izy ireo
Or maybe you can’t.	na angamba tsy afaka
For these reasons.	noho ireo antony ireo
We are with them on that.	miaraka aminizy ireo izahay aminizany
I think we can be really good.	heveriko fa afaka ny ho tsara tokoa isika
I don't see why.	tsy hitako izay antony
And it’s worth it.	ary mendrika izany
So, that may not be the real reason.	noho izany mety tsy ho antony marina izany
So, for sure it would be a better option.	noho izany ho azo antoka dia ho safidy tsara kokoa
This process is many.	ity dingana ity dia maro
I don't see what to gain.	tsy hitako izay ho azo
Maybe tonight.	mety ho anio alina
On the same day.	aminny andro iray ihany
Don’t work hard.	aza miasa mafy
Whether you like it or not, it doesn’t matter.	na tianao na tsy tianao dia tsy olana izany
But that is only one option.	safidy iray ihany anefa izany
However, and it’s great.	na izany aza ary lehibe izany
He just had something else about him.	nanana zavatra hafa momba azy fotsiny izy
He doesn’t like them.	tsy tiany izy ireo
He used to be really crazy.	tena adala izy taloha
He is crazy about them.	adala aminizy ireo izy
Still no.	mbola tsy nisy ihany
But that may not be a good idea.	saingy mety tsy hevitra tsara izany
Without money, we can go far.	raha tsy misy ny vola dia afaka mandeha lavitra isika
He didn't think so.	tsy nieritreritra izany izy
It will always be so.	ho toy izany foana izany
It will be difficult.	ho sarotra izany
You are not even from here.	tsy avy eto akory ianao
But I think it’s a good fit.	heveriko anefa fa mety tsara izany
He does it and makes good money.	manao izany izy ary mahazo vola tsara
It’s hard to get a part of it.	sarotra ny mahazo ampahany aminizany
That's all.	izany rehetra izany
There is another.	misy iray hafa
We really needed it.	tena nila izany izahay
At first, it seems like more work.	aminny voalohany dia toa asa bebe kokoa izany
The world loves him.	tia azy izao tontolo izao
To me, he’s become less of a person.	amiko dia lasa tsy dia olona loatra izy
It won’t always be that way.	tsy ho toy izany foana
It was nice to see him there.	nahafinaritra ny nahita azy teo
I did it once.	nanao izany aho indray mandeha
The same is true, anyway.	toy izany koa na izany na tsy izany
Same as before.	mitovy aminny teo aloha ihany
And it doesn’t make much sense.	ary tsy dia misy dikany loatra izany
There was no word about me.	tsy nisy teny momba ahy
But you started it.	fa ianao no nanomboka izany
The real problem, however, is the land.	ny tena olana anefa dia ny tany
I’ve always loved the style.	tiako foana ilay fomba
You can even make another one.	afaka manao iray hafa mihitsy aza ianao
Almost three years.	efa ho telo taona
Then it's gone again.	dia lasa izao indray
But I don’t see it.	saingy tsy hitako izany
He may be right.	mety ho marina izy
I know you don't love me.	fantatro fa tsy tia ahy ianao
It is generally safer as well.	aminny ankapobeny dia azo antoka kokoa koa
That way they all get one man, not even one.	aminizany fomba izany izy rehetra dia mahazo lehilahy iray tsy misy na dia iray aza
I think we do that last thing.	heveriko fa manao izany zavatra farany izany isika
We all have them.	isika rehetra dia manana azy ireo
But it is completely different.	hafa tanteraka anefa izany
I really like the idea.	tena tiako ilay hevitra
He had everything.	nanana ny zavadrehetra izy
He then went further.	lasa lavitra kokoa izy avy eo
I really do.	tena manao izany aho
It seems right to me.	toa mety amiko
Everyone needs a home.	mila trano daholo ny olona
I had to stop and think about it.	tsy maintsy nijanona aho ary nieritreritra izany
But this year is different this year.	saingy aminity taona ity dia hafa ny aminity taona ity
Also, it should be the right kind.	ary koa tokony ho ny karazana mety
Everyone needs their own time.	mila fotoana manokana ny tsirairay
There are women there.	misy vehivavy any
But something was wrong.	nisy zavatra anefa tao
I was so wrong.	tena diso aho
And we already have.	ary efa manana isika
That’s all he is.	izany rehetra izany izy
The question did not come.	tsy tonga ny fanontaniana
He thought a little.	nieritreritra kely izy
Not everything is right for him.	tsy mety aminy ny zavadrehetra
It was fun to see it.	nahafinaritra ny nahita azy io
It will be worse.	ho ratsy kokoa
You, if necessary.	ianao raha ilaina
But, it can be difficult.	saingy mety ho sarotra izany
That's exactly what it should be.	izany indrindra no tokony ho izy
I only have two questions, really.	manana fanontaniana roa fotsiny aho tena
They stayed for a day or two.	nijanona iray na roa andro izy ireo
He has never been there.	mbola tsy tonga tany mihitsy izy
We start a conversation.	manomboka resaka izahay
But it is gone.	tsy eo intsony anefa izy io
Difficult as before.	sarotra toy ny taloha
One is enough.	ampy ny iray
Yes, these are questions for another day.	eny fanontaniana ho anny andro hafa ireo
I should have had a question.	tokony nanana fanontaniana aho
And they are already working on it.	ary efa manomboka miasa aminizany izy ireo
Both of them are full of work.	ny roa aminizy ireo dia feno asa
He is gone now.	lasa izy izao
But it can work in other ways as well.	saingy mety miasa aminny fomba hafa koa izany
The food is good.	tsara ny sakafo
I think it’s more than that, though.	heveriko fa mihoatra noho izany anefa izany
Not that there is a problem with that.	tsy hoe misy olana aminizany
I always want to be sure.	tiako foana ny mahazo antoka
Look at.	jereo ao aminny
I might be wrong about that.	mety ho diso hevitra aho aminizany
It will be easier next time.	ho mora kokoa izany aminny manaraka
But people are not simple.	tsy tsotra anefa ny olona
In his place.	eo aminny toerana misy azy
It doesn’t go like this.	tsy mandeha toy izao izany
Maybe you too.	angamba ianao koa
The results now appear to be good.	hita fa tsara ny vokatra ankehitriny
You really like it.	tena tianao izany
One is gone.	lasa ny iray
And they did the same.	ary nanao toy izany koa izy ireo
He knows that too.	fantany izany koa
At first.	aminny voalohany
When they came to me, they stopped.	rehefa tonga tamiko izy ireo dia nijanona
When you need it, you need it.	rehefa mila izany ianao dia mila izany
That is not the case today.	tsy izany no zavamisy ankehitriny
It’s not always about getting the first and best of everything.	tsy foana ny mahazo ny voalohany sy ny tsara indrindra aminny zavadrehetra
There is no money.	tsy misy vola
Apparently we all have a lot of time.	hita fa manana fotoana betsaka isika rehetra
The place is really big.	lehibe tokoa ilay toerana
He won't even come to war.	tsy ho tonga aminny ady akory izy
Everyone loves money.	tia vola ny olona rehetra
Of course, it goes the other way as well.	mazava ho azy fa mandeha aminny fomba hafa koa izany
He doesn't have a car.	tsy manana fiara izy
It's easy.	mora izany
Very true, too.	tena marina koa
He now had it.	nanana azy izy izao
I don’t know these people.	tsy fantatro ireo olona ireo
The former is not completely stupid.	tsy adala tanteraka ny taloha
I could have done the same.	mety ho nanao toy izany koa aho
And the time has not yet come.	ary mbola tsy tonga ny fotoana
The car went faster and stopped better.	nandeha mafy ny fiara ary nijanona tsara kokoa
Something really bad.	zavatra tena ratsy
But you are very good.	fa tena tsara ianao
However, it may only take time.	na izany aza angamba fotoana fotsiny no ilaina
There is a story.	misy tantara
However, this is still unclear.	mbola tsy mazava tsara anefa izany
Which of course doesn’t work.	izay mazava ho azy fa tsy mandeha
They were not all there.	tsy teo izy rehetra
This is not a big problem, but a problem.	tsy olana lehibe izany fa olana
Then, they seem to see themselves as better people.	avy eo toa mijery ny tenany ho olona tsara kokoa izy ireo
I have a question about that.	manana fanontaniana momba izany aho
But everything else is completely different.	fa ny zavatra hafa rehetra dia hafa tanteraka
The same is true of everyone else.	toy izany koa aminny hafa rehetra
The results are very close.	tena akaiky ny vokatra
Lots to go.	betsaka ny mandeha
They’re great, you know.	lehibe izy ireo fantatrao
There were no games.	tsy nisy lalao
Do it fast.	ataovy haingana
Apparently this is a good idea.	hita fa hevitra tsara izany
I am very fast.	tena haingana aho
This is also not the first time.	tsy izany koa no voalohany
It was more fun than usual for me.	nahafinaritra kokoa noho ny mahazatra izany tamiko
It's good for him.	tsara ho azy izany
It had to be real.	tsy maintsy tena nisy izany
But not so now.	tsy mba toy izany anefa izy izao
Here is a picture you can make your own.	ity ny sary azonao atao ny anao manokana
The fact is, it’s not easy.	ny zavamisy dia tsy mora izany
He couldn't think straight.	tsy afaka nieritreritra tsara izy
It is very true.	tena marina ilay izy
It can really come from anywhere.	mety ho avy aminny toerana rehetra tokoa izany
you are alone now.	irery ianao izao
So don’t just do it.	ka tsy atao ihany
He's dead, man.	maty izy lehilahy
There were real facts.	nisy ny zavamisy marina
One can be wrong, yes, one is often wrong.	mety ho diso ny iray eny diso ny iray matetika
These things are no longer true to me.	tsy marina amiko intsony ireo zavatra ireo
He loves me.	tia ahy izy
When you work, you earn very little.	rehefa miasa ianao dia kely dia kely ny azonao
I saw mine.	hitako ny ahy
I have never had a man like that.	mbola tsy nisy lehilahy toy izany tamiko
They could be.	mety ho izany izy ireo
Yes, less than this one.	eny kely kokoa noho ity iray ity
It has to, whether they like it or not.	tsy maintsy izany na tiany na tsia
It’s always different.	hafa foana izany
I am still right.	mbola marina ihany aho
These people, however, are certainly part of it.	ireo olona ireo anefa dia azo antoka fa ampahany aminizany
Just like the person he is today.	toy ny olona nisy azy ankehitriny
That's far.	lavitra izany
It’s only going to be fast from here on out.	haingana ihany izany manomboka eto
Although it’s a lot.	na dia betsaka aza izany
There was a reason.	nisy antony
Thank you so much.	misaotra anao indrindra
He did a lot of work.	nanao asa be dia be izy
He was in the world around him.	tao aminny tontolo manodidina azy izy
It still exists.	mbola misy izany
And the last days have come.	ary tonga ny andro farany
There are two facts.	misy zavamisy roa
A stranger.	olona tsy fantany
They needed to take a closer look.	nila nijery akaiky kokoa izy ireo
The results are the same.	mitovy ny vokatra
First of all, it may not be that bad.	voalohany indrindra mety tsy ho ratsy izany
The same is true for products.	toy izany koa ho anny vokatra
Now they’re looking at the part as well.	ankehitriny dia mijery ny ampahany koa izy ireo
There could have been nothing better.	tsy nisy zavatra tsara kokoa angamba
He will not be lost.	tsy ho very izy
They are all gone.	lasa izy rehetra
It just came to me.	tonga tamiko fotsiny izany
I have a man.	manana lehilahy iray aho
But it’s so beautiful.	fa tena tsara tarehy
But everything is meaningless.	tsy misy dikany anefa ny zavadrehetra
Too much and too often in fact.	be loatra ary matetika loatra raha ny marina
It wasn’t going to be easy.	tsy nisy ho mora izany
I still have it too.	mbola manana azy koa aho
You can’t get it any better than that.	tsy afaka mahazo izany tsara kokoa noho izany ianao
Maybe we don’t.	angamba tsy manao izany isika
I'm not very fast.	tsy dia haingana aho
And yes, it really is.	ary eny izany tokoa
Sometimes it’s better to look bad.	indraindray dia tsara kokoa ny mijery ratsy
It doesn’t go very well with me.	tsy dia mandeha loatra amiko
And he seems to be the real thing.	ary toa izy no tena izy
It really does everything right.	tena manao ny zavadrehetra tsara izy io
And there was almost always money.	ary saika nisy vola foana
There could be a lot to follow.	mety ho be dia be ny manaraka
They are almost there.	saika eo ihany izy ireo
Eventually he did.	ela ny ela dia nanao izany izy
He couldn’t have done it otherwise.	tsy afaka nanao izany izy raha tsy izany
The story is always the same.	mitovy foana ny tantara
I have never seen anything like it.	tsy mbola nahita zavatra toy izany
It is important to do.	zavadehibe ny atao
But maybe it is.	fa angamba izany
That is true.	izany no marina
So it’s easier here.	ka mora kokoa ny eto
He is also there.	misy koa izy
Everyone is free.	afaka ny rehetra
Often, though, they do not.	matetika anefa izy ireo no tsy manao izany
It could all be good.	mety ho tsara daholo izany
Such nonsensical food.	sakafo tsy misy dikany toy izany
I can't work.	tsy afaka miasa aho
Yeah, it doesn’t seem to matter to me, well.	eny toa tsy misy dikany amiko ilay izy tsara
They just aren’t enough.	tsy ampy azy ireo fotsiny
People started looking at me.	nanomboka nijery ahy ny olona
But it should be easy.	tokony ho mora ihany anefa izany
He was not there himself.	tsy teo ny tenany
There is nothing better than that.	tsy misy tsara kokoa noho izany
Not so before.	tsy toy izany taloha
Maybe it was something completely different.	angamba zavatra hafa tanteraka ilay izy
He told me he did.	nilaza tamiko izy fa nanao izany
This was the greatest moment for me !.	izany no fotoana lehibe indrindra ho ahy
Yes, there was.	eny nisy izany
I couldn't think straight.	tsy afaka nieritreritra tsara aho
We are in another place.	eo aminny toerana hafa isika
Certainly it is possible.	azo antoka fa azo atao izany
The question went.	nandeha ny fanontaniana
They are gone now.	efa lasa izy ireo izao
But the story is really beautiful.	fa ny tantara dia tena tsara tarehy
Newcomers are sure to come here again.	azo antoka fa ho avy eto indray ireo vao tonga
This is my favorite dish.	ity no sakafo tiako indrindra
I'm going around.	ho any aminny manodidina aho
But something is missing.	fa misy tsy hita
But that doesn't suit me.	tsy mety amiko anefa izany
I don’t have a big problem with that.	tsy manao olana lehibe aminizany aho
The kind where there’s no question about it.	ny karazana izay tsy misy fanontaniana momba izany
True, he knew.	marina fa fantany
You have gone too far.	lasa lavitra ianao
We will be lost.	ho very isika
There was a woman.	nisy vehivavy iray
Probably not completely dead.	angamba tsy maty tanteraka
That is the problem here.	izay no olana eto
That little bit didn’t make sense.	tsy nisy dikany izany kely izany
It’s not fun anymore.	tsy mahafinaritra intsony
You don’t want to make up stories about yourself.	tsy te hanao ny tantara momba anao ianao
He looked inside.	nijery tao anatiny izy
No story, you don’t need one.	tsy misy tantara tsy mila iray ianao
But so are we.	fa isika koa
But he is very close.	tena akaiky anefa izy
Or you already have it.	na efa nanana izany ianao
They don’t.	tsy manao izany izy ireo
Then he looked at me first.	dia nijery ahy voalohany izy
Thank you for doing something for me, actually.	misaotra anao nanao zavatra ho ahy raha ny marina
This is far from the usual picture.	lavitra ny tena sary matetika izany
The land is better.	tsara kokoa ny tany
Great job, as always !.	asa lehibe toy ny mahazatra
No one is around tonight.	tsy misy olona manodidina anio alina
Something fun.	zavatra iray mahafinaritra
Nothing complicated.	tsy misy sarotra
Yes, we have the choice now.	eny manana ny safidy isika izao
Like men for women.	toy ny lehilahy ho anny vehivavy
These are better days, of course.	andro tsara kokoa ireo mazava ho azy
He doesn't know why.	tsy fantany ny antony
It could just be one of those things.	mety ho iray aminireo zavatra ireo fotsiny izany
My surroundings do the same.	manao toy izany koa ny manodidina ahy
I'm lost right now.	very aho aminizao fotoana izao
It could be now.	mety ho izy izao
Almost, though.	na saika na izany aza
I know now that none of this is true.	fantatro izao fa tsy misy marina izany
It’s also fun because it’s different.	mahafinaritra koa satria hafa
That place didn’t really exist.	tsy tena nisy io toerana io
At all times, in fact.	aminny fotoana rehetra raha ny marina
It’s like they’re going to be tough.	toy ny hoe ho sarotra izy ireo
Here people are happy.	eto dia faly ny olona
I was very happy with the result.	tena faly aho taminny vokatra
Not worth the idea.	tsy mendrika ny hevitra
No one saw it, but he saw it.	tsy nisy olona nahita izany fa izy no nahita
There are two problems with this.	misy olana roa aminizany
Along with .	miaraka aminny
Many people do the same at home.	olona maro no manao toy izany koa aminny trano
For a beginner like me, this is the hardest part.	ho anny vao manomboka toa ahy dia sarotra indrindra izany
There really is.	misy marina izany
And he already knows.	ary efa fantany
This reason may even be true.	mety ho marina mihitsy aza izany antony izany
The first step begins with words.	ny dingana voalohany dia manomboka aminny teny
There was a large part missing.	nisy ampahany lehibe tsy hita
Love the place.	tia ny toerana
Everyone said so.	samy nilaza izany ny rehetra
So, not too bad.	noho izany tsy dia ratsy loatra
Money means too much to me.	misy dikany loatra amiko ny vola
It can be very personal.	mety ho anny tena manokana ilay izy
He just went for it.	nandeha taminizany fotsiny izy
He has never loved anyone like that.	mbola tsy tia olona toy izany mihitsy izy
There is nothing wrong with that.	tsy misy ratsy ao
This is a bit unusual.	somary tsy mahazatra izany
You can be completely free and completely crazy.	afaka ny ho afaka tanteraka sy adala tanteraka ianao
But it doesn’t work.	saingy tsy mandeha izany
Of course not anymore.	mazava ho azy fa tsy izany intsony
Some are good, some are not.	ny sasany dia tsara ny sasany tsy
That is, you don’t.	izany hoe tsy manao izany ianao
She loved him so much.	tiany loatra izy
It’s starting to die for me.	manomboka izao ny maty ho ahy
There are so many around you.	manodidina anao ny be dia be
They need it.	mila izany izy ireo
In the past, he said.	taloha hoy izy
The best game ever.	ny lalao tsara indrindra foana
She really loves him.	tena tiany izy
It's been a long time.	efa ela izay
These people did good things.	nanao zavatra tsara ireo olona ireo
There was no choice.	tsy nisy safidy
This is very wrong.	tena diso tokoa izany
It seems so.	toa izany
In general.	aminny ankapobeny
He expects me to be there.	manantena ahy ho any izy
We have needed it for a long time.	efa ela izahay no nila izany
It seems impossible.	toa tsy azo atao izany
Even now, in the last days.	na dia izao aza aminizao fotoana farany izao
Of course, they just did.	mazava ho azy fa nanao izany fotsiny izy ireo
I don’t need part of the meaning.	tsy mila ampahany aminny dikany aho
Then look at it.	dia jereo izany
The results are not good.	tsy tsara ny vokatra azo
It made a difficult world simple.	nanao tontolo sarotra ho tsotra izany
Here is the result.	ity ny vokatra
You have a choice.	manana safidy ianao
It can be misleading.	mety ho diso hevitra izy io
It’s not hard at all.	tsy sarotra mihitsy
He is different now.	hafa izy izao
Lots of good things to come.	betsaka ny zavatra tsara ho avy
Eventually the truth will be found.	aminny farany dia ho hita ilay marina
We have to go far, fast.	tsy maintsy mandeha lavitra isika haingana
Immediately, in fact.	eo no ho eo raha ny marina
We have many such things.	manana zavatra maro toy izany isika
There was no choice about it.	tsy nisy safidy momba izany
That’s a lot, that’s really me.	be dia be izany izany no tena ahy
I already have two issues.	efa manana olana roa aho
I shouldn't have come.	tsy tokony ho tonga aho
It is a war for them.	ady ho azy ireo izany
Yes, better than nothing.	eny tsara noho ny tsy misy
And so it is with the earth.	ary toy izany koa ny tany
Often with the same people.	matetika aminny olona mitovy
This comes in the following way.	izany dia tonga aminny fomba manaraka
Some of these people need to get real.	ny sasany aminireo olona ireo dia mila mahazo ny tena izy
This, too, is certainly wrong.	izany koa dia azo antoka fa diso
He does it for himself.	izy no manao izany ho anny tenany
What is uncertain is uncertain.	ny tsy azo antoka dia tsy azo antoka
He must have had a reason.	tsy maintsy nanana antony izy
I thought you might as well.	nieritreritra aho fa mety ho ianao koa aza
But it is also different.	hafa ihany koa anefa izany
Here’s the real news or something.	izao ny tena vaovao na zavatra hafa
It doesn’t seem difficult to do so.	toa tsy sarotra ny manao izany
There is something now.	misy zavatra izao
I am a grown woman.	vehivavy lehibe aho
It’s hard for you to see that.	sarotra aminao ny mahita izany
He had seen her once.	efa nahita azy indray mandeha izy
That and that only.	izany ary izany ihany
But this man is not like that.	tsy toy izany anefa ity lehilahy ity
I hope he doesn’t.	manantena aho fa tsy manao izany izy
It was not fun to see.	tsy nahafinaritra ny nahita
He knew he was dead.	fantany fa maty izy
They have a lot.	manana be dia be izy ireo
Not sure if anything went wrong.	tsy azo antoka raha nisy zavatra ratsy
He didn't look at me anymore.	tsy nijery ahy intsony izy
This is about.	izany dia momba ny
And one was confused by it.	ary ny iray very hevitra taminizany
But for me.	fa ho ahy
It all seems so familiar.	toa mahazatra loatra izany rehetra izany
Now it comes.	ankehitriny dia tonga izany
So it doesn’t work well for me.	ka tsy mandeha tsara amiko izany
Here, right now.	eto aminizao fotoana izao
We didn’t get him and he didn’t get us.	tsy nahazo azy izahay ary tsy nahazo anay izy
That's the problem for me.	eo no olana amiko
Anyway, he had a lot of money.	na izany na tsy izany nanana vola be izy
It’s almost too hard.	saika sarotra be izany
She is not pretty either.	tsy tsara tarehy koa izy
You may have an idea.	mety manana hevitra ianao
It doesn't work.	tsy mandeha io
It also meant something to him.	nisy dikany ho azy koa
This is a fun event for everyone !.	ity dia hetsika mahafinaritra ho anny rehetra
He could have stopped.	afaka nijanona izy
He did it to me.	nanao izany tamiko izy
Too much action.	be loatra ny hetsika
The other one is gone.	lasa ny iray hafa
Nothing was done.	tsy nisy natao
But that was not the case.	tsy nisy anefa izany
Then do the same with the other words.	dia ataovy toy izany koa ny teny hafa
There is no food, they said.	tsy misy sakafo hoy izy ireo
I’m glad he did.	faly aho fa nanao izany izy
We are all happy.	faly izahay rehetra
We can do it though.	afaka manao izany isika na izany aza
They are both good men.	samy lehilahy tsara izy ireo
Make a face.	manao tarehy
A lot of people do that.	betsaka ny olona manao izany
And there he went.	ary teo izy no nandeha
But one is very happy.	fa tena faly ny iray
You deserve more than that.	mendrika mihoatra noho izany ianao
Not that they probably will.	tsy hoe hanao izany angamba izy ireo
There is nothing special about the story.	tsy misy zavatra manokana momba ny tantara
It was good for him.	tsara taminy izany
You don’t know anything.	tsy fantatrao na inona na inona
See more about it here.	jereo bebe kokoa momba izany eto
I think that’s what’s important.	heveriko fa izay no zavadehibe
It’s not too much either.	tsy dia be loatra koa izy io
You have to be different, different and better.	tokony ho hafa ianao hafa ary tsara kokoa
But we don’t have to get into that problem.	tsy mila tonga aminizany olana izany anefa isika
Not right now, he said.	tsy aminizao fotoana izao hoy izy
Which works well.	izay miasa tsara
And it’s hard work.	ary asa sarotra izany
It was as if the world was full again.	toy ny hoe feno indray izao tontolo izao
Now it appears they do.	ankehitriny dia hita fa manao izany izy ireo
I think he was happy.	heveriko fa faly izy
That's enough talking first.	ampy izay ny resaka aloha
He can't do it again.	tsy afaka manao izany indray izy
Yes, he did.	eny nanao izany izy
I never thought you would do that.	tsy nieritreritra mihitsy aho hoe hanao izany ianao
They don’t anymore.	tsy manao intsony izy ireo
Even the past is no longer the same.	na ny lasa aza tsy mitovy intsony
It really makes sense.	tena misy dikany izany
I know that’s not enough.	fantatro fa tsy ampy izany
He didn’t know it.	tsy fantany izany
And no one does that at all.	ary tsy misy olona manao izany mihitsy
I also love doing things.	tiako koa ny manao zavatra
The day will be clear.	ho andro mazava ny andro
Work is the most important thing.	ny asa no zavadehibe indrindra
That's his.	izay ny azy
They weren’t there for me.	tsy nisy ho ahy izy ireo
He also works there.	miasa any koa izy
I enjoyed it.	nahafinaritra ahy izany
But that day is not yet clear.	tsy mbola mazava anefa izany andro izany
I don't think that's possible.	heveriko fa tsy azo atao izany
We got news.	nahazo vaovao izahay
If so, he will come to the wrong place.	raha izany no izy dia ho tonga aminny toerana tsy mety izy
The only problem is he’s not here yet.	ny olana fotsiny dia tsy mbola eto izy
He was about to do it.	saika hanao izany izy
But here’s the special part.	fa eto ny ampahany manokana
That is the reality.	izany no zavamisy
It’s just one of those things.	iray aminireo zavatra ireo ihany izany
You can’t have both !.	tsy afaka manana azy roa ianao
Such a place.	toerana toy izany
And he got the woman.	ary nahazo ny vehivavy izy
No one said anything either.	tsy nisy nilaza na inona na inona koa izy ireo
This is for the following reason.	izany dia noho ity antony manaraka ity
It could be.	mety ho izy
Needless, in fact, no words.	tsy ilaina raha ny marina tsy misy teny
But that is the way.	fa izany no lalana
Worse is yet to come.	mbola ho avy ny ratsy kokoa
There is only one way.	iray ihany ny lalana
It didn’t make much sense to me.	tsy dia nisy dikany tamiko izany
But it is also wrong.	tsy mety koa anefa izany
When he finally got there, it wasn’t good.	rehefa tonga tany ihany izy dia tsy tsara
It’s not so good with anything else.	tsy dia tsara loatra aminny zavatra hafa izany
The truth is the ground is hard.	ny marina dia mafy ny tany
Land means.	tany no dikany
It does a good job.	manao asa tsara izany
We are very good, but not enough.	tena tsara izahay saingy tsy ampy
We can do it once.	afaka manao izany indray mandeha isika
They were the only ones who did it.	izy ireo irery no nanao izany
It’s more than he deserves.	mihoatra noho izay mendrika azy izany
Only he could have made me good to you.	izy ihany no afaka nanao ahy ho tsara aminao
He doesn't seem happy.	toa tsy faly izy
I will find the best way.	ho hitako ny fomba tsara indrindra
You look too, you get it too.	mijery ihany koa ianao dia azonao ihany koa
Because you get it now.	satria azonao izao
I have something about that.	manana zavatra momba izany aho
It seemed so close.	toa akaiky tokoa ilay izy
Even if only for the day.	na dia ho anny andro fotsiny aza
But there should be no more than that.	saingy tsy tokony hisy mihoatra izany
Maybe so, but not fast enough for me.	angamba izany fa tsy ampy haingana ho ahy
He really liked the question.	tena tiany ilay fanontaniana
But he was there when he needed them.	teo anefa izy rehefa nila azy ireo
But he had seen it.	saingy efa nahita izany izy
He was just a man.	lehilahy fotsiny izy
So we have an idea.	ka manana hevitra isika
It all seems normal.	toa mahazatra izany rehetra izany
The food just became unpleasant.	lasa tsy nahafinaritra fotsiny ny sakafo
It means very little to me.	tena kely ny dikany amiko
It’s a real story.	tantara tena izy io
Not yet and probably not yet.	tsy mbola ary mety tsy mbola
You are.	ianao dia
Here we had a problem.	eto izahay dia nisy olana
No one likes ideas anymore.	tsy misy tia hevitra intsony
Way, harder.	fomba mafy kokoa
This is one of the last times.	ity dia iray aminireo fotoana farany
But he hasn’t done anything about it yet.	tsy mbola nanao na inona na inona momba izany anefa izy
It may not even exist.	mety tsy hisy akory izany
The picture is still there.	mbola eo ny sary
That's what they are.	izany no izy ireo
But they are very wrong.	tena diso anefa izy ireo
And the reason is not very clear.	ary tsy dia mazava loatra ny antony
This is a bad idea for many reasons.	hevitra ratsy izany noho ny antony maro
Not a little either.	tsy kely koa
He looked around, unsure.	nijery manodidina izy tsy azo antoka
Especially not for him.	indrindra fa tsy ho azy
There are three possible ways.	fomba telo no azo atao
Not just now.	tsy vao izao ihany
It’s nice to see what’s right.	mahafinaritra ny mahita ny mety
Or about many other things.	na momba ny zavatra maro hafa
I have a lot of stories.	manana tantara maro aho
Soon someone will do it.	tsy ho ela dia hisy olona hanao izany
He had no words for her.	tsy nanana teny ho azy izy
This is part of me.	ity dia ampahany amiko
I really need to do that.	tena mila manao izany aho
Still no idea.	mbola tsy misy hevitra
It can be difficult to do.	mety ho sarotra ny manao izany
Yes, it is possible.	eny mety izany
He saw each of us.	nahita anay tsirairay izy
But not tonight.	fa tsy anio alina
Because it doesn’t exist now.	satria tsy misy izany ankehitriny
Whether they watch it or not.	na mijery izany izy ireo na tsia
We can't have it now.	tsy afaka manana izany isika ankehitriny
Not a woman.	tsy vehivavy
From both.	avy aminizy roa
Because it didn’t stop.	satria tsy nijanona izany
Now he could do nothing.	ankehitriny dia tsy afaka nanao na inona na inona izy
It was meant to be.	natao ho azy izany
But the final game was really tough.	saingy tena sarotra ny lalao farany
None of us died.	tsy nisy maty izahay
The reality may be that.	ny zavamisy dia mety ho izany
This is the first place.	ity no toerana voalohany
They are three major ones.	telo lehibe izy ireo
He died that we might not be.	maty izy mba tsy hisy antsika
His and hers.	ny azy sy ny azy
That’s enough to be worth it.	ampy ho mendrika izany
Now maybe not.	ankehitriny angamba tsy izany
A place like no other.	toerana tsy nisy toa azy io
Do what is right.	ataovy izay mety
I work with them.	miasa aminizy ireo aho
Some of them will be easy.	ny sasany aminizy ireo dia ho mora
But the truth is, they are good.	saingy ny marina dia tsara izy ireo
If you want to do something good.	raha te hanao zavatra tsara ianao
I have been doing this for a long time.	efa ela aho no nanao izany
You have to work with them.	tsy maintsy miasa aminizy ireo ianao
We all have ours.	samy manana ny azy isika
That is, it is not a pleasant story.	izany hoe tsy tantara mahafinaritra izany
He already had a great life.	efa nanana fiainana be dia be izy
It’s fun to take pictures of the day !.	mahafinaritra ny manao sary ny andro
He just died.	vao maty izy
This war is a great war.	ady lehibe ity ady ity
He looked around carefully.	nijery tsara ny manodidina izy
We did that often.	nanao izany matetika izahay
It is not a job.	tsy asa izany
It will never happen.	tsy hisy mihitsy izany
No one will do that.	tsy misy olona hanao izany
There seems to be no end to each day.	toa tsy misy farany ny andro tsirairay
It needs to be done properly.	mila manao izany araka ny tokony ho izy
In this work we follow a completely different approach.	aminity asa ity dia manaraka fomba hafa tanteraka isika
It takes two approaches.	mila fomba roa izany
Everyone was there.	teo daholo ny rehetra
We have to go.	tsy maintsy mandeha isika
But it is not crowded.	saingy tsy feno olona
But he will do it.	fa izy no hanao izany
Yes, no, no.	eny tsia tsia
This is a first step.	dingana voalohany izany
It goes fast.	mandeha haingana izany
this is a bad night.	alina ratsy ity
She is very beautiful.	tena tsara tarehy izy
It’s a tough game.	lalao sarotra izany
I knew he was just a man.	fantatro fa olona fotsiny izy
But you.	fa ianao
He never said that.	tsy nilaza izany mihitsy
I know it’s personal to you.	fantatro fa manokana anao izany
Or he used to be.	na izy taloha
It’s not much.	tsy dia betsaka izany
Or maybe not.	na angamba tsy izy
But there is something better here.	saingy misy zavatra tsara kokoa eto
But he told me this one was different.	nilaza tamiko anefa izy fa hafa ity iray ity
Nothing is clearer.	tsy misy zavatra mazava kokoa
But he didn’t know it.	saingy tsy fantany izany
It’s more complicated, and may not be necessary.	sarotra kokoa izany ary mety tsy ilaina
That’s the worst thing.	izany no zavatra ratsy indrindra
But we have.	fa manana izahay
I think that’s a great idea.	heveriko fa hevitra lehibe izany
They are dead.	maty izy ireo
You have to get very close.	tsy maintsy lasa akaiky be ianao
That’s the most fun.	izany no mahafinaritra indrindra
He must have been very confused.	tsy maintsy very hevitra be izy
Almost the same.	saika mitovy aminy
But it’s also good.	tsara ihany koa anefa izany
But they are beautiful and suitable for me.	tsara tarehy anefa izy ireo ary mety amiko
They work as follows.	izy ireo dia miasa toy izao manaraka izao
In fact, it is impossible to do so.	raha ny marina dia tsy azo atao ny manao izany
It really made a lot of sense.	tena nisy dikany loatra izany
Some work better for some people than others.	ny sasany dia miasa tsara kokoa ho anny olona sasany noho ny hafa
This one makes no sense.	tsy misy dikany ity iray ity
Often, though, this is not the case.	matetika anefa no tsy izany
It is difficult to understand.	sarotra azo ilay izy
Often the little fun things seem trivial.	matetika dia toa tsy misy dikany ny zavatra mahafinaritra kely
It’s all about them.	momba azy ireo daholo izany
I'm watching now.	mijery aho izao
I thank them again.	misaotra azy ireo indray aho
Now that would be something.	ankehitriny dia ho zavatra izany
Not here, or there.	tsy eto na any
Anyway, a woman did it.	na izany na tsy izany vehivavy iray no nanao izany
Maybe he didn’t.	angamba tsy nanao izany izy
I did it again.	nanao izany indray aho
They will do it perfectly.	hanao izany tanteraka izy ireo
You don’t have to do anything to be able to work.	tsy mila manao na inona na inona ianao vao afaka miasa
This is not the best option.	tsy izany no safidy tsara indrindra
This is very important to him.	tena zavadehibe aminy izany
He is the one.	izy no iray
It’s a clear choice.	safidy mazava izany
This is different again.	hafa indray ity
The same is true today.	toy izany koa ankehitriny
Someone doesn't need you here.	misy tsy mila anao eto
Yes, maybe we are.	eny angamba isika
It’s all new.	vaovao daholo izany
We are not too stupid here.	tsy adala loatra izahay eto
As for me, yours is no better.	raha ny momba ahy dia tsy tsara kokoa ny anao
It was easy for me.	mora tamiko izany
We are busy.	be atao izahay
Admittedly, this may be an easier task for people.	marina fa mety ho asa mora kokoa ho anny olona izany
He just looked at me.	nijery ahy fotsiny izy
I think it’s obvious.	heveriko fa hita izany
However, they seem to be different.	na izany aza toa samy hafa izy ireo
And it was made for me.	dia natao ho ahy izany
I can't go far.	tsy afaka mandeha lavitra aho
Not as it should be.	tsy araka ny tokony ho izy
It's a man.	lehilahy iray io
They are absolutely necessary.	tena ilaina tanteraka izy ireo
do, do.	manao manao
The man is his.	azy ilay lehilahy
He really loves them because of it.	tena tia azy ireo tokoa izy noho izany
Farther.	lavitra kokoa
I will never be wrong again.	tsy ho diso aho intsony
We disagree if this is not right.	tsy mitovy hevitra izahay raha tsy mety izany
And other pictures as well.	ary ny sary hafa koa
And it didn’t make sense to me.	ary tsy nisy dikany tamiko izany
He was very happy with her.	tena faly taminy izy
The battle will be more difficult.	ho sarotra kokoa ny ady
That’s as it should be, of course.	izany dia araka ny tokony ho izy mazava ho azy
It can be too difficult.	mety ho sarotra loatra izany
You have them.	manana azy ireo ianao
I made a good choice.	nanao safidy tsara aho
Some people like them, some don’t.	misy olona tia azy ireo ny sasany tsy tia
He was not happy about that.	tsy faly taminizany izy
There is nothing really bad or good.	tsy misy tena ratsy na tsara
Then he thought again.	dia nieritreritra indray izy
i have you	manana anao aho
And it’s not entirely safe.	ary tsy azo antoka tanteraka
But only for you.	fa ho anao ihany
Both had them.	samy nanana azy ireo
He’s still fast but different.	mbola haingana izy fa hafa
They may need it.	mety mila izany izy ireo
But it is also very difficult to do.	tena sarotra ihany koa anefa ny manao izany
Both are not good.	samy tsy tsara izy roa
He could see.	afaka nahita izy
There was nothing worse.	tsy nisy zavatra ratsy kokoa
None of this really happened.	toa tsy tena nisy izany rehetra izany
She can't help but be beautiful.	tsy afaka ny tsy ho tsara tarehy izy
Yes, he thought.	eny hoy izy nieritreritra
All the men were there.	teo aloha daholo ny lehilahy
But not in this one.	fa tsy aminity
That's a lot of money.	vola be io
But he is not the last.	tsy izy anefa no farany
There is too much life inside.	be loatra ny fiainana ao anatiny
He became dislike of everything.	lasa tsy tia ny zavadrehetra izy
This is very low.	ity dia ambany dia ambany
Not because it won’t happen anymore.	tsy hoe satria tsy hisy intsony izany
Housing is not a question.	tsy fanontaniana ny trano
Not at night.	tsy taminny alina
Others do it more.	ny hafa dia manao izany bebe kokoa
You don’t need that.	tsy mila izany ianao
Just working is okay.	miasa fotsiny dia mety
I just started it.	vao nanomboka izany aho
It seemed like part of it.	toy ny ampahany taminizany izany
At first, they weren’t very numerous.	taminny voalohany dia tsy dia maro loatra izy ireo
About the two of us, actually.	momba antsika roa raha ny marina
It all went that way in the end.	nandeha taminizany daholo izany taminny farany
We have a lot of it.	be dia be aminizany isika
This is just a fun time.	ity fotoana mahafinaritra ity ihany
However, this is also a problem.	na izany aza olana ihany koa izany
That's bad.	izany no ratsy
I don’t want to do it alone.	tsy te hanao izany irery aho
Many of them do not work.	maro aminizy ireo no tsy miasa
It’s too much for them.	be loatra ho azy ireo izany
Two products work.	vokatra roa no miasa
But this is.	fa ity dia
Fast and simple.	haingana sy tsotra
You have the idea.	manana ny hevitra ianao
You can go for it.	afaka mandeha aminizany ianao
I know that very well.	fantatro tsara izany
He himself said it.	izy mihitsy no nilaza izany
I said maybe.	hoy aho angamba
It’s best to keep them simple.	tsara raha atao tsotra fotsiny izy ireo
No words really said that.	tsy nisy teny tena nilaza izany
In this place.	aminity toerana ity
He could have done it all.	afaka nanao izany rehetra izany izy
This one is worse than the first.	ratsy noho ny voalohany ity iray ity
No big games.	tsy misy lalao lehibe
He can't see you today.	tsy afaka mahita anao izy anio
You can do this if you want.	azonao atao izany raha tianao
They did not stop.	tsy nijanona izy ireo
He is doing better and better.	manao tsara kokoa sy tsara kokoa izy
I will be there.	ho eo aho
I don't even know why.	tsy fantatro akory ny antony
Here is the story.	toy izao ny tantara
This is the worst idea.	io no hevitra ratsy indrindra
The game is the same.	ny lalao dia mitovy
Your type never does that.	tsy manao izany mihitsy ny karazana anao
Yes, it works well.	eny miasa tsara izy io
There is nothing for you right now.	tsy misy na inona na inona ho anao aminizao fotoana izao
I think that’s really good for us.	heveriko fa tena tsara ho antsika izany
Such a simple thing is of course more than that.	ny zavatra tsotra toy izany dia mazava ho azy fa mihoatra ny azy
He didn't want to do that anymore.	tsy te hanao izany intsony izy
Now, they love him.	ankehitriny tia azy izy ireo
If possible, of course.	raha mety mazava ho azy
There is too much around him.	be loatra ny manodidina azy
At first he couldn't even find a word.	taminny fotoana voalohany dia tsy nahita teny akory izy
We have two options.	manana safidy roa izahay
Sure it should.	azo antoka fa tokony
But he is going well.	saingy mandeha tsara izy
They really look at it.	tena mijery izany izy ireo
He needed another option.	nila safidy hafa izy
He loved her the most.	tiany indrindra izy
Only one night.	indray alina ihany
They are such wonderful people.	tena olona mahafinaritra tokoa izy ireo
However, general results are also possible.	na izany aza azo atao ihany koa ny vokatra ankapobeny
It seems normal.	toa mahazatra
I hope it will happen.	manantena aho fa ho tanteraka izany
We need to do it fast.	mila manao izany haingana isika
This idea is very wrong.	tena diso io hevitra io
But it takes time.	mila fotoana anefa izany
You’re pretty normal.	tsara tarehy mahazatra ianao
And therefore, it is not possible.	ary noho izany dia tsy azo atao izany
If we have a problem, this is it.	raha manana olana isika dia ity
This is where the problem begins.	eto no manomboka ny olana
That’s probably not the right way to go.	tsy izany angamba no fomba mety
Not mine.	tsy ny ahy
It’s a bit hard to work with.	somary sarotra ny miasa
The world has become simple, easy, not difficult.	lasa tsotra mora tsy sarotra izao tontolo izao
This one works and works well.	ity dia miasa ary miasa tsara
It was very difficult for me.	tena sarotra tamiko izany
Everything in the world is fast.	haingana ny zavadrehetra eto aminizao tontolo izao
I really am.	tena izany aho
I think that's what it is.	heveriko fa izany no izy
I still saw him.	mbola nahita azy aho
With other men.	miaraka aminny lehilahy hafa
Not enough space, of course.	tsy ampy ny toerana mazava ho azy
In the end, however, it is often simple.	aminny farany anefa matetika dia tsotra
Now, that won’t happen.	ankehitriny tsy hisy izany
There were only two things that mattered to me then.	zavatra roa ihany no zavadehibe tamiko taminizany
This is for all of us.	ho antsika rehetra ity
Both are good.	samy tsara ireo
A busy busy man.	lehilahy be atao be atao
There is nothing like it.	tsy misy toa azy
And you can do the same.	ary afaka manao izany koa ianao
Nor did they die immediately.	tsy maty eo no ho eo koa izy ireo
Then I saw something else.	nahita zavatra hafa indray aho avy eo
Something will come of it.	hisy zavatra ho avy aminizany
That man.	io lehilahy io
Just like people.	toy ny olona ihany
But, no matter what, they only had one.	saingy na inona na inona dia nanana iray ihany izy ireo
It could be simpler.	mety ho tsotra kokoa izany
Do it if you can.	ataovy izany raha azonao atao
They often do.	matetika izy ireo no manao izany
They have good food.	manana sakafo tsara izy ireo
It was hard for me to do it at first.	sarotra amiko ny manao azy aminny voalohany
He can do so much better than that.	afaka manao zavatra tsara lavitra noho izany izy
He’s really great.	tena lehibe izy
It’s not enough for just enough people.	tsy ampy ho anny olona ampy fotsiny izany
Of course, this is not true.	mazava ho azy fa tsy marina izany
It works like this.	miasa toy izao izy io
It’s so easy to find him now.	mora tokoa ny nahita azy ankehitriny
At any time, you can start all over again.	aminny fotoana rehetra dia afaka manomboka indray ianao
The story is very true.	tena marina ilay tantara
It’s fun to be together.	mahafinaritra ny miaraka
It's a good game.	lalao tsara io
It will simply be a new world for everyone.	ho tontolo vaovao ho anny rehetra fotsiny izy io
There were a lot of people too.	be dia be koa ny olona
Now there was always something.	ankehitriny dia nisy zavatra foana
They are with me.	miaraka amiko izy ireo
You may need to start working.	mila manomboka miasa angamba ianao
This is not a problem for me.	tsy olana amiko izany
Then they came here.	dia tonga eto izy ireo
No two days are the same.	tsy misy roa andro mitovy
But he loves you.	tia anao anefa izy
There is no time for things like this right now.	tsy misy fotoana ho anny zavatra toy ny aminizao fotoana izao
But there was no next part.	tsy nisy anefa ny ampahany manaraka
Something worse.	zavatra ratsy kokoa
It’s probably gone now.	efa lasa angamba izao
So, it is.	noho izany izy io
Such a thing is different.	hafa ihany ny zavatra toy izany
He can't be low.	tsy afaka ny ho ambany izy
I need them all.	mila azy rehetra aho
We all love to do that.	isika rehetra dia tia manao izany
Be as clear as possible.	ataovy mazava araka izay azo atao
He is a small man.	lehilahy kely izy
That's how it should be.	izay no tokony ho izy
It was a completely different world.	tontolo hafa tanteraka ilay izy
And to come.	ary ho avy
It's too big.	lehibe loatra izany
I know the truth.	fantatro ny marina
He is not doing very well.	tsy dia mandeha tsara izy
But it's a house.	fa trano io
And as soon as he came, he went.	ary raha vao tonga izy dia lasa
But not completely.	saingy tsy tanteraka
Other times, he said.	aminny fotoana hafa hoy izy
If he doesn’t do a good job.	raha tsy manao asa tsara izy
He didn't know that.	tsy fantany izay
The man is doing well.	mandeha tsara ilay lehilahy
And happy.	ary faly
I think so.	heveriko fa izany
It wasn't very good for me.	tsy dia tsara loatra tamiko ilay izy
Which is really good.	izay tena tsara
And, he knew he had to do it fast.	ary fantany fa tsy maintsy manao izany haingana izy
But he is very ugly.	tena ratsy tarehy anefa izy
This is the most important thing.	izany no zavadehibe indrindra
That’s the kind of idea.	izany no karazana hevitra
And have them.	ary manana azy ireo
But it’s all a method.	fa izany rehetra izany dia fomba
They had to stay where they were.	tsy maintsy nijanona teo aminny toerana nisy azy izy ireo
I'm good enough.	ampy tsara aho
But, again, it’s different.	saingy indray hafa izany
Time, the truth.	ny fotoana ny marina
That’s great.	izay no lehibe
It sounds silly, but it’s not.	toa adala izany saingy tsy izany

He is also lonely, which is very unusual.	irery ihany koa izy izay tena tsy mahazatra tokoa
But not too much.	tsy be loatra anefa
So we will do it.	noho izany dia hanao izany isika
That might just be a good thing.	mety ho zavatra tsara ihany izany
He would have done it, if he wanted to.	efa nanao izany izy raha tiany
And he doesn’t know why.	ary tsy fantany ny antony
If we really have.	raha manana tokoa isika
He said he was not like them.	nilaza izy fa tsy mitovy aminizy ireo izy
At one time.	aminny fotoana iray
And all is lost.	ary very daholo
Everyone.	ny olona tsirairay
Because this woman is alone.	satria irery io vehivavy io
It works really well.	tena miasa tsara
I got lost and went for it.	very aho ary nandeha ho azy
I almost did.	saika nanao izany aho
But that is only the first step.	izay ihany anefa no dingana voalohany
He is very real right now.	izy dia tena misy aminizao fotoana izao
He was a normal man.	lehilahy mahazatra izy
But women, he likes.	fa ny vehivavy tiany
Difficult years.	taona sarotra
It is not difficult.	tsy sarotra izany
Nothing looks good.	tsy misy toa tsara izany

Here, there was nothing.	eto tsy nisy na inona na inona
The problem comes here.	tonga eto ny olana
We are alone now.	irery izahay izao
Everything belongs to everyone.	anny rehetra ny rehetra
If you don’t get one, you lose the guarantee.	raha toa ka tsy afaka ny iray ianao dia very ny antoka
And she will never be alone again.	ary tsy ho irery intsony izy
It will be beautiful one night.	ho tsara tarehy indray mandeha alina
Probably true too.	marina koa angamba
They are not very big.	tsy dia lehibe loatra izy ireo
And that is the problem.	ary io no olana
There was no reason.	tsy nisy antony
But to be there.	fa ho any
No one goes there.	tsy misy olona mandeha any
There are pros and cons.	misy ny mety sy ny tsy mety
We take action from them.	manao hetsika avy aminizy ireo izahay
That’s a good idea.	hevitra tsara izany
I think he likes her too.	heveriko fa tiany koa izy
They had what they needed.	nanana izay ilaina izy ireo
But not a lot of money.	fa tsy vola be
All of this is very important.	tena zavadehibe tokoa izany rehetra izany
This is similar to the next question.	izany dia mitovy aminny fanontaniana manaraka
Not from him.	tsy avy aminy
Of course, the reality is more complicated.	mazava ho azy fa sarotra kokoa ny zavamisy
That’s part of it.	izany no ampahany aminizany
That’s really all.	tena rehetra izany
Very convenient.	tena mety
Not even for you.	tsy ho anao akory
But it was fun.	nahafinaritra anefa izany
This is good news and bad.	vaovao tsara sy ratsy izany

These are just questions.	fanontaniana ihany ireo

Sometimes you are wrong.	diso hevitra ianao indraindray
Of course, there are better people.	mazava ho azy fa misy olona tsara kokoa
That is, it may not be for everyone.	izany hoe mety tsy ho anny rehetra izany
Everyone looked at him.	nijery azy ny rehetra
Which is absolutely true.	izay marina tanteraka
Not a small thing.	tsy zavatra kely
It’s endless fun to watch.	mahafinaritra tsy misy farany ny mijery azy
If you lose one, you may lose a lot.	raha very iray ianao dia mety ho very be
He looks inside.	mijery ao anatiny izy
It must be the same man.	tsy maintsy io lehilahy io ihany
But it is a special job.	asa manokana anefa izany
Not when it comes to money, though.	tsy rehefa resaka vola na izany aza
It’s really, really good.	tena tsara dia tsara izany
No one works hard.	tsy misy miasa mafy
All missing.	rehetra tsy hita
And I said yes !.	dia hoy aho hoe eny
The game is the same.	toy izany koa ny lalao
There is no real food.	tsy misy tena sakafo
The war began.	nanomboka ny ady
They had been gone for two days.	efa roa andro izy ireo no tsy tao
Maybe he’s good.	tsara angamba izy
That's the way life is in general.	izany no fiainana aminny ankapobeny

Two at most.	roa raha be indrindra
We can always do more.	afaka manao bebe kokoa hatrany isika

He did it quickly.	nanao izany haingana izy
There is nothing special about them.	tsy misy na inona na inona manokana aminizy ireo
I always get a lot of questions about it.	mahazo fanontaniana be dia be momba izany foana aho

It didn’t matter.	tsy nisy zavadehibe izany
Yes, you get the idea.	eny azonao ny hevitra

He saw her right away.	nahita azy avy hatrany izy

Very long.	tena ela be
But that seems to be the only way.	toa izany ihany anefa no lalana
Time is of the essence.	tena zavadehibe aminizany ny fotoana
I'm confused by that.	very hevitra aho aminizany
He recently thought of doing it himself.	vao haingana izy no nieritreritra ny hanao ny tenany
With so many other things you can do.	miaraka aminny zavatra maro hafa azonao atao
You look very beautiful.	hita fa tena tsara tarehy ianao
And it still does.	ary mbola manao izany
Somewhat lost.	somary very
We are women.	vehivavy izahay
There is nothing wrong there.	tsy misy diso any

Then it came to me.	dia tonga tamiko izany
Then the story went.	dia nandeha izany tantara izany
But there was no time now.	tsy nisy fotoana anefa izao
They really did exist.	tena nisy tokoa izy ireo
He loves the good life.	tiany ny fiainana tsara
He was that age.	taminizany taona izany izy
It didn’t mean anything.	tsy nisy dikany na inona na inona izany
The word soon came.	tsy ela dia tonga ny teny

It's just wrong.	diso fotsiny izany
he is ours too.	antsika koa izy

Yes, he will not.	eny tsy hanao izany izy
He is needed now, more than ever.	tena ilaina izy ankehitriny mihoatra noho ny taloha
Both said yes.	hoy ny roa hoe eny
That would be a fun thing for me.	mety ho zavatra mahafinaritra ho ahy izany
And there were other problems.	ary nisy olana hafa
Not much here.	tsy dia betsaka eto
There are many possibilities that are not understood.	betsaka ny mety tsy azo
You don't understand anything.	tsy azonao na inona na inona
We always come to him.	tonga hatrany ho azy izahay
There was a good reason.	nisy antony tsara
From then on, the word didn’t seem to come.	nanomboka teo dia toa tsy tonga ny teny
Although such a life was not easy, he did it.	na dia tsy mora aza ny fiainana toy izany dia nanao izany izy
Or better than usual.	na tsara kokoa noho ny mahazatra
Here is the story.	ity ny tantara
A lot of work needs to be done.	mila atao be dia be ny asa
Some of it started to make sense.	nanomboka nisy dikany ny sasany taminizany
First, and of course, this is not generally true.	voalohany ary mazava ho azy tsy marina aminny ankapobeny izany
They will never know.	tsy ho fantany mihitsy
And, in fact, that is exactly the reality.	ary raha ny marina izany indrindra no zavamisy
Must have a car.	tsy maintsy manana fiara
Not too far away.	tsy dia lavitra loatra
He already knew this woman.	efa fantany io vehivavy io
They can do it.	afaka manao izany izy ireo
It’s not that he’s missing.	tsy hoe tsy hita izy
It was definitely the same man, he told himself.	azo antoka fa io lehilahy io ihany hoy izy taminny tenany
It will be a beautiful thing.	ho zavatra tsara tarehy izany
They cannot be real.	tsy mety ho tena izy ireo

People like that.	olona toa azy io
You need to have the final word on everything.	mila manana ny teny farany aminny zavadrehetra
It was real.	tena nisy tokoa ilay izy
The question is whether it is true or not.	ny fanontaniana dia hoe marina na tsia
The next day will do.	ny andro manaraka dia hanao
But some are hard to find.	sarotra hita anefa ny sasany
He had no idea.	tsy nanana hevitra izy
But it will be very difficult.	ho sarotra be anefa izany
But it’s a bit of a stretch.	somary kely anefa izany
He will do it again.	mbola hanao izany indray izy
Hard as you like.	mafy araka izay tianao
And very happy too.	ary tena faly koa
Really delicious food.	sakafo mahafinaritra tokoa
This is good and bad.	izany no tsara sy ratsy
But it is not found.	tsy hita anefa izany
I think he deserves it.	heveriko fa mendrika izany izy
He works hard for us.	miasa mafy ho antsika izy
Then he is still a problem.	dia mbola olana ihany izy
In him they were supreme.	tao aminy izy ireo no ambony indrindra
I had to have it.	tsy maintsy nanana izany aho
It was too good.	tsara loatra ilay izy
However, maybe he had an idea.	na izany aza angamba nanana hevitra izy
But we don't need him.	tsy mila azy anefa isika
It will be like this.	ho toy izao izany
And very little.	ary kely dia kely
I know that very well.	fantatro be izany
You are very beautiful.	tena tsara tarehy ianao
I see that.	hitako izany
And he did.	ary nanao izany izy
But that is all.	izay ihany anefa
In fact, it is real.	raha ny marina dia tena misy izy io
With a man.	miaraka aminny lehilahy iray
Of course, he had a choice to become one.	mazava ho azy fa nanana safidy ho lasa iray izy
Of course, things did not always go well.	mazava ho azy fa tsy nandeha tsara foana ny zavadrehetra
You are very important.	tena ilaina ianao
But, he’s not that fast.	saingy tsy dia haingana izy
It’s still a good road.	mbola lalana tsara izy io
And they do.	ary manao izany izy ireo
He is very close.	tena akaiky izy
I hope there won’t be any more.	manantena aho fa tsy hisy intsony
He doesn’t like the real thing.	tsy tiany ny tena izy
So other tasks may not work as well.	noho izany dia mety tsy mandeha koa ny asa hafa
The place was very crowded.	feno be ilay toerana
Not you, not them.	tsy ianao tsy izy ireo
They may not know it.	mety tsy ho fantany izany
And soon he would be gone, he knew.	ary tsy ho ela dia ho lasa izy fantany
But he doesn't have to work.	tsy mila miasa anefa izy
There was something else as well.	nisy zavatra hafa ihany koa
They are kind of new.	karazana vaovao izy ireo
Do it well and everything seems to be going well.	ataovy tsara ary toa mandeha ny zavadrehetra
He is not the real thing.	tsy izy no tena izy
And of course, that is not the case.	ary mazava ho azy fa tsy izany no izy
He had never come so hard and fast before.	mbola tsy tonga mafy sy haingana toy izany izy taloha
I don't know why.	tsy fantatro ny antony
The same was true last year.	toy izany koa ny taona lasa
But it’s also good.	saingy tsara ihany koa
Like this and that.	toy izao sy izao
It’s really fun to see it.	tena mahafinaritra tokoa ny mahita azy
Now the next one goes.	ankehitriny dia mandeha ny manaraka
It is not clear.	tsy mazava izany
See what works for you.	jereo izay mety aminao
But you look good.	fa ianao no tsara mijery
He is the other option.	izy no safidy hafa
And you need more.	ary mila bebe kokoa koa ianao
I know they will.	fantatro fa hanao izany izy ireo
I go with things.	mandeha aminny zavatra aho
If you can find it.	raha toa ka afaka mahita azy ianao
He is better than us.	tsara kokoa noho isika izy
It shouldn’t be hard to be with him.	tsy tokony ho sarotra ny miaraka aminy
A must have.	tsy maintsy manana izany
Or you can go.	na afaka mandeha ianao
But that is not entirely clear.	saingy tsy mazava tanteraka izany
So this thing is another year.	ka taona hafa izany zavatra izany
You may never understand.	mety tsy ho azonao mihitsy
There seemed to be a little bit of everything.	toa nisy kely ny zavadrehetra
An idea you may not know.	hevitra tsy fantatrao angamba
Lots of surroundings.	betsaka ny manodidina
You just can’t walk.	tsy afaka mandeha fotsiny ianao
A lot, a lot.	be dia be be dia be
I don’t see him as he used to be.	tsy hitako ho toy ny taloha izy
They are not good.	tsy tsara izy ireo
But it was a long time ago.	efa ela anefa no lasa
It works well, especially.	miasa tsara izy io indrindra
I fell in love with him.	lasa tia azy aho
This is the latest news.	izany no vaovao farany indrindra
We can't do anything.	tsy afaka manao na inona na inona izahay
In fact, it is not.	raha ny marina dia tsy izany
He has great things.	manana zavatra lehibe izy
It never happened.	tsy nisy mihitsy izany
No one will do it for you.	tsy misy olona hanao izany ho anao
I hope to be free next year.	manantena aho fa ho afaka aminny taona ho avy
It didn’t go to them.	tsy lasa azy ireo izany
It was there.	teo tokoa
That's where he wants to be right now.	teo no tiany hisy aminizao fotoana izao
Time is wasted.	very ny fotoana
He too had died in the past.	efa maty taminny lasa koa izy
He loves this thing.	tiany io zavatra io
I didn’t see much of it where I was.	tsy dia hitako loatra taminny toerana misy ahy izany
But that is not enough.	tsy ampy mihitsy anefa izany
I don't know him.	tsy fantatro izy
Impossible choice, sometimes.	safidy tsy azo atao indraindray
Maybe you don’t.	angamba tsy manao izany ianao
If you do, look at the options.	raha manao izany ianao dia jereo ny safidy
I was glad I did.	faly aho nanao izany
It stopped very quickly.	nijanona haingana be izany
They will all be beautiful.	ho tsara tarehy izy rehetra
It’s just crazy.	adala fotsiny izany
So that’s the story.	dia izay no tantara
He loves other people.	olona hafa no tiany
I find that to be completely untrue.	hitako fa tsy mety mihitsy izany
They could not see him.	tsy afaka nahita azy izy ireo
I think that’s important.	heveriko fa zavadehibe izany
I do it now.	manao izany aho izao
But in general it is not.	saingy aminny ankapobeny dia tsy izany
This is fast.	ity dia haingana
In fact, it’s very fast.	raha ny marina tena haingana be izany
We can’t start anywhere else.	tsy afaka manomboka aminny toerana hafa isika
It's okay for me to be with him too.	mety amiko koa ny miaraka aminy
It has to be a woman.	tsy maintsy vehivavy izany
I love having people.	tiako ny manana olona
This is the real thing.	ity no tena izy
He used to be less visible.	tsy dia hita loatra izy taloha
He was real and not very real, sometimes.	tena nisy izy ary tsy dia nisy loatra indraindray
Some are more stupid than others.	ny sasany adala kokoa noho ny hafa
It will be the same.	izany dia ho toy izany koa
It was not designed specifically.	tsy natao manokana izany
I like these.	tiako ireo
We all come, we all go.	tonga daholo isika mandeha daholo
Well, of course.	tsara mazava ho azy
It is indeed so.	dia izany tokoa
I'm happy with that.	faly aho aminizany

It always does one or the other.	manao iray na hafa foana izany
The problem should be on your end.	ny olana dia tokony ho eo aminny farany anao

It does something.	manao zavatra izany
But in fact, not the least bit of evil.	fa raha ny marina tsy ny kely indrindra aminny ratsy
The work is very accessible to everyone.	ny asa dia tena mora azo ho anny rehetra
Not in a special place.	tsy aminny toerana manokana
This is wrong.	diso izao
But you are not yet.	saingy tsy mbola izany ianao
If any follow.	raha misy manaraka
There is news for you.	misy vaovao ho anao
They were still there.	mbola nisy izy ireo
But there is much more to it than that.	saingy misy zavatra betsaka kokoa noho izany
I have nothing on me.	tsy manana na inona na inona amiko aho
We stayed there for two main reasons.	nijanona tany izahay noho ny antony roa lehibe
I have never done a night out.	tsy mbola nanao alina mihitsy
And to be happy.	ary mba ho faly
We have no other choice.	tsy manana safidy hafa izahay

Just come here.	tonga eto fotsiny
It went.	nandeha izany
It was fun to watch these things.	nahafinaritra ny nijery ireo zavatra ireo
But it was absolutely necessary.	nila tanteraka anefa izany
He looked around himself.	nijery manodidina ny tenany izy
I have it all here.	manana azy rehetra eto aho
But generally he doesn’t.	saingy aminny ankapobeny dia tsy manao izany izy
He has come a long way now.	efa tonga lavitra izao izy
That is life.	izany no fiainana
It works really well.	tena miasa tsara izy io
Too many choices.	be loatra ny safidy
I want to do good.	te hanao ny tsara aho
If this sounds like you, you are in the right place.	raha toa ianao ka toa anao izany dia eo aminny toerana mety ianao
He has an idea.	manana hevitra izy
This game is definitely for you.	azo antoka fa ho anao ity lalao ity
He looks around.	mijery manodidina izy
It was a fun and very exciting time.	fotoana nahafinaritra sy tena nahafinaritra izany
Maybe he got everything wrong.	nahazo ny zavadrehetra tsy araka ny tokony ho izy angamba izy
Whether to do or not to do.	na manao na tsy manao
But he could not say that.	tsy afaka nilaza izany anefa izy
This is a game that is just a game.	ity dia lalao izay lalao fotsiny
He really loves us all.	tena tia anay rehetra izy
This is a great game for us.	lalao lehibe ho antsika io
They still work for them, for the most part.	mbola miasa ho azy ireo izy ireo aminny ankapobeny
In fact, this may be completely wrong for some.	raha ny marina dia mety ho diso tanteraka ho anny sasany izany
And of course it is.	ary mazava ho azy izany
In those days.	taminizany andro izany
We need that fight.	mila izany ady izany isika
Kind of crazy, but that's what it was.	karazana adala tokoa fa izay no nisy
I don't know if this is it.	tsy fantatro raha ity no izy
He has already said that.	efa nilaza izany izy
I didn’t find her pretty.	tsy nahita azy ho tsara tarehy aho
But it seems so.	saingy toa izany
Not very well done.	tsy dia tsara atao
Don't go too far.	aza mandeha lavitra
But the end result is the same.	mitovy ihany anefa ny vokatra farany
I know, he thought.	fantatro hoy izy nieritreritra
But we have one.	saingy manana iray isika
Still you.	mbola ianao ihany
I was not there for long.	tsy teo ela aho
He had to watch it for himself.	tsy maintsy nijery azy manokana izy
You may get lost in the end.	mety ho very ianao aminny farany
There are old problems.	misy ny olana taloha
People die like that.	maty toy izany ny olona
This is not the first time.	tsy vao voalohany izao
But that can be difficult.	mety ho sarotra anefa izany
This thing doesn’t have that problem.	ity zavatra ity dia tsy manana izany olana izany
But you didn’t.	saingy tsy nanao izany ianao
But he is not like that.	tsy toy izany anefa izy
This is a real event.	tena hetsika tokoa ity

Really and thank you so much for these wonderful words.	tena ary misaotra indrindra aminireo teny mahafinaritra ireo
The former does not.	tsy manao izany ny teo aloha
You just don’t get it.	tsy azonao tsotra izao

So don't do it.	koa aza manao izany

My favorite is the photos and the car.	ny sary sy ny fiara no tena tiako
It’s also a fun job.	asa mahafinaritra ihany koa izy io
Which is indeed true.	izay marina tokoa
This is a big problem for him.	olana lehibe ho azy izany
It became less fun.	lasa tsy dia nahafinaritra intsony
It's just a fact of life.	zavamisy eo aminny fiainana fotsiny izany
There seemed to be no time.	toa tsy nisy fotoana
I was so happy to see both of them.	faly be aho nahita azy roa
Just in general, everything else.	ny ankapobeny ihany ny hafa rehetra
Whatever may be in it.	na inona na inona mety ho ao anatiny
Some work better than others.	ny sasany miasa tsara kokoa noho ny hafa
A little easier.	somary mora kokoa
Because, because, because.	satria satria satria
He never had another job.	tsy nanana asa hafa mihitsy izy
Like everyone else.	toy ny hafa rehetra
He is easy to find.	mora hita izy
There is no certainty of the next.	tsy misy azo antoka ny manaraka
For many people too.	ho anny olona maro koa
It just works really well.	tena miasa tsara fotsiny izy io
They were not the only ones there.	tsy izy ireo ihany no teo
But he was very important in those days.	tena zavadehibe anefa izy taminizany andro izany
It is best to be in a place with no roads.	ny tsara indrindra dia any aminny toerana tsy misy lalana
I like a lot of things.	betsaka ny zavatra tiako
I can't watch it now.	tsy afaka mijery izany aho izao
Not everyone is like that.	tsy ny rehetra no toy izany
I needed to think differently.	nila nieritreritra hafa aho
But he knew very little.	kely anefa ny zavatra fantany
When you have to work, you have to work.	rehefa tsy maintsy miasa dia tsy maintsy miasa
I didn't see anything else.	tsy nahita zavatra hafa aho
Bad and real.	ratsy sy tena izy
Maybe he knows everything about you.	angamba fantany daholo ny momba anao
Not too big.	tsy dia lehibe loatra
They did nothing wrong.	tsy nanao ratsy izy ireo
So here they are.	ka eto izy ireo
The one who will make the right choice.	ilay hanao safidy tsara
It doesn’t matter.	tsy zavadehibe izany
In real life, no.	aminny tena fiainana tsia
Just done.	vao avy nanao
The truth is you have already started doing it.	ny marina dia efa nanomboka nanao izany ianao
So is he.	toy izany koa izy
He is also fast.	haingana koa izy
Really crazy up there.	tena adala any ambony any
But it is also too far away.	lavitra loatra koa anefa izany
If only it had.	raha mba nisy izany
If only he had told her he loved her.	raha mba nilaza taminy izy fa tia azy
I’m a decent woman, you know.	vehivavy mendrika aho fantatrao
I hope he loses his job.	manantena aho fa very asa izy
That should not be possible.	tsy tokony ho azo atao izany
It may mean something to you.	mety hisy dikany aminao izany
But he knew he was right.	fantany anefa fa marina izy
We are not there yet.	mbola tsy tonga aminizany isika
He was often away and needed one.	matetika izy no tsy teo ka mila iray
They are simple.	tsotra izy ireo
Or just something fun.	na zavatra mahafinaritra fotsiny
That's enough.	ampy izay
He began to think that they could not do wrong.	nanomboka nieritreritra izy fa tsy afaka manao ratsy izy ireo
They had never done that before.	mbola tsy nanao toy izany mihitsy izy ireo taloha
And that’s important.	ary zavadehibe izany
I could have done it now, you know.	afaka nanao izany aho izao fantatrao
That could be a lot.	mety ho maro izany
It was hard for him to think.	sarotra taminy ny nieritreritra
But it is not yet complete.	mbola tsy feno anefa izany
I think that’s a real thing.	heveriko fa tena zavatra izany
And that seems to be the first time.	ary toa ny voalohany izany
When you did.	rehefa nanao izany ianao
It has to be all of them or not.	tsy maintsy ho izy rehetra na tsia
There are pictures.	misy sary
The world was his.	izao tontolo izao no nisy azy
Sure, what it is.	azo antoka inona izany
There was nothing certain about it.	tsy nisy zavatra azo antoka momba izany
I work.	miasa aho
These things are very important.	tena zavadehibe ireo zavatra ireo
We needed to make sure someone was free.	nila nahazo antoka izahay fa misy olona afaka
He didn't have one.	tsy nanana na dia iray aza izy
It is much more than that.	mihoatra lavitra noho izany izany
I have a house there.	manana trano aho any
Good to start.	tsara ny manomboka
It’s not hard to find them but everywhere.	tsy sarotra ny nahita azy ireo fa teny rehetra teny
Otherwise, there is no real problem with the facts.	raha tsy izany dia tsy misy olana marina momba ny zavamisy
They are here.	eto izy ireo
It’s not about everything, but it’s definitely about him.	tsy momba ny zavadrehetra fa azo antoka fa momba azy
And it seems to have stopped for now.	ary toa nijanona izany aminizao fotoana izao
It was good, and it was really fun.	tsara izany ary tena nahafinaritra
There is no evil, there is no evil.	tsy misy ratsy tsy misy ratsy
You seem to be able to do anything.	toa afaka manao na inona na inona ianao
It has already begun.	efa nanomboka izany
This is where many of us are.	eto no misy antsika maro be
He still had no idea.	mbola tsy nanana hevitra izy
It all came to fruition.	tonga tanteraka izany rehetra izany
He was lost.	very izy
Mine is bigger.	ny ahy dia lehibe kokoa
Now, and don’t.	ankehitriny ary aza manao
It will be much harder than that.	ho sarotra lavitra noho izany
But not his.	fa tsy ny azy
I think they are both.	heveriko fa izy roa
On another day.	aminny andro hafa
It seems wrong to me.	toa diso amiko
Because it went wrong.	satria nandeha ratsy
There were a lot of them.	be dia be teo izy ireo
And he said to another.	dia hoy izy taminny iray hafa
They are all very good.	tena tsara daholo izy ireo
But this time is different.	hafa anefa ity fotoana ity
It won’t matter.	tsy ho zavadehibe izany
If it is not done now, it will be done.	raha tsy tanteraka izao dia ho tanteraka izany
This is life, a time like this.	izany no fiainana fotoana toy izao
And that’s right, they are.	ary marina izany izy ireo
This is not easy to do.	tsy mora ny manao izany
He is coming.	ho avy izy
They are found in other foods as well.	izy ireo dia hita ao aminny sakafo hafa koa
This is good money.	izao no vola tsara
Everything seems different.	toa hafa ny zavadrehetra
He himself saw everything.	izy mihitsy no nahita ny zavadrehetra
I hope we can do it again once.	manantena aho fa afaka manao izany indray isika indray mandeha
But that will not be enough.	tsy ho ampy anefa izany
Maybe we are.	angamba isika
But they had me.	saingy nanana ahy izy ireo
It is real.	tena izy io
But make no mistake.	aza diso anefa
That’s the last thing.	izany no zavatra farany
I think he told me that.	heveriko fa izy no nilaza izany tamiko
You can do this many ways.	afaka manao izany fomba maro ianao
The process is simple.	tsotra ny dingana
Then the man left.	dia lasa ilay lehilahy
Maybe you just need time and space for a specific reason.	angamba mila fotoana sy toerana fotsiny ianao noho ny antony manokana
He was happier.	faly kokoa izy
The land was beautiful.	nahafinaritra be ny tany
It’s so beautiful inside.	tena tsara tarehy anatiny izany
And not at all.	ary tsy izany mihitsy
You really exist.	tena misy ianao
We have no information about these things.	tsy manana vaovao momba ireo zavatra ireo izahay
When it comes to that.	raha tonga aminizany
Good money if you can.	vola tsara raha azonao atao
I'll see it.	ho hitako izany
Same person as before.	olona mitovy aminny teo aloha ihany
It’s like it’s just a matter of time.	toy ny hoe resaka fotoana fotsiny
But that is not the case.	tsy izany anefa no zavamisy
But we had no idea.	tsy nanana hevitra anefa izahay
We need more of that.	mila bebe kokoa aminizany isika
Of course, this is not possible.	mazava ho azy fa tsy azo atao izany
He is not here.	tsy eto izy
Maybe they are all dead.	angamba efa maty daholo izy ireo
Just because they could have, at all times, and didn’t.	satria fotsiny izy ireo dia afaka nanana aminny fotoana rehetra ary tsy nanao
He doesn't look at me.	tsy mijery ahy izy
Not only that.	tsy hoe fotsiny
I should deserve it.	tokony mendrika izany aho
He didn't look too much.	tsy dia nijery loatra izy
Maybe, something else.	angamba zavatra hafa
However, you have no choice.	na izany aza tsy manana safidy ianao
He is not all bad.	tsy ratsy daholo izy
But that’s a problem.	saingy olana izany
It’s instantaneous.	eo no ho eo izany
I have never seen one that way.	mbola tsy nahita na iray aza taminizany fomba izany aho
We are the first.	isika no voalohany
The car was fun.	nahafinaritra ilay fiara
We didn’t stop there.	tsy nijanona teo izahay
The food, in fact, is very good.	ny sakafo raha ny marina dia tena tsara
They were looking at things.	nijery zavatra izy ireo
And not only that.	ary tsy izay ihany
It’s really easy when you get it.	tena mora izany rehefa azonao
They came.	tonga izy ireo
They did not have much housing.	tsy dia nanana trano izy ireo
But life is good.	fa tsara ny fiainana
You have to find a new place.	tsy maintsy mahita toerana vaovao
Anyway, they said, we had two on one.	na izany na tsy izany hoy izy ireo dia nanana roa taminny iray izahay
And so, we thought we couldn’t do it.	ary noho izany nieritreritra izahay fa tsy afaka manao izany izahay
I've never been like that before.	mbola tsy toy izany mihitsy aho
No one saw it.	tsy nisy nahita izany
Now, the closer you are.	ankehitriny ny akaiky anao
Because you can’t do it alone.	satria tsy afaka manao izany irery
It’s always far away.	lavitra foana izany
They are the problem.	izy ireo no olana
But look at us.	fa jereo izahay
He will be very happy.	ho faly tokoa izy
I would be lost without him.	very aho raha tsy nisy azy
I have it.	manana izany aho
There are everywhere.	misy eny rehetra eny
They are close.	akaiky izy ireo
But now he is.	fa izy indray izao no izy
However, there is still a lot of work to be done.	na izany aza mbola betsaka ny asa
I hope not.	manantena aho fa tsy izany
It has never been like this.	tsy mbola nisy toy izao
It was so full.	feno be ilay izy
It's a little early now.	kely ihany aloha izao
Nothing is safer.	tsy misy azo antoka kokoa
And it’s all from you.	ary avy aminao daholo izany
This work was fun.	nahafinaritra ity asa ity
He sees nothing.	tsy mahita na inona na inona izy
The past was meaningless.	tsy nisy dikany ny lasa
There are other reasons.	misy antony hafa
Or to be found.	na ho hita
I love the unusual.	tiako ny tsy mahazatra
And it really did exist.	ary tena nisy tokoa izany
We both have them.	samy manana azy ireo isika
Gone, just like that.	lasa toy izany ihany
You can start now.	afaka manomboka izao ianao
Now he needs to work.	aminizao fotoana izao dia mila miasa izy
But this is wrong for obvious reasons.	tsy mety anefa izany noho ny antony mazava
I just love this game.	tiako fotsiny ity lalao ity
There are still questions, of course.	mbola misy fanontaniana mazava ho azy
But that is not the problem here.	tsy izany anefa no olana eto
Because it’s all important, he said.	satria zavadehibe izany rehetra izany hoy izy
You will lose a lot of things.	ho very zavatra maro ianao
To look at it.	ny mijery azy
That is far from good.	lavitra ny tsara izany
They desperately needed good news, and it was.	tena nila vaovao tsara izy ireo ary izy ilay izy
We have to get the facts right.	tsy maintsy mahazo ny zavamisy marina isika
Things, not much.	zavatra tsy dia betsaka
The first is more difficult.	ny voalohany no sarotra kokoa
It was really hard.	tena mafy ilay izy
The story is not so bad.	tsy tena ratsy ny tantara
As fast as possible.	haingana araka izay azo atao
But it is small.	kely anefa izany
The results are very good.	tena tsara ny vokatra
So, you know they are beautiful homes.	noho izany fantatrao fa trano tsara tarehy izy ireo
They are watching us.	mijery antsika izy ireo
It’s just a dead mistake.	diso maty fotsiny izany
Basically we can see the future.	aminny ankapobeny dia afaka mahita ny ho avy isika
They have traveled a long way.	nandeha lavitra be izy ireo
It has to be good.	tsy maintsy tsara izany
She loved watching him.	tiany ny nijery azy
And we were the only two who did it.	ary izahay roa ihany no nanao izany
People are.	ny olona dia
Of course I didn’t.	mazava ho azy fa tsy nanao izany aho
Either way or whatever.	na izany na izany na izany na izany na
You never saw me.	tsy nahita ahy mihitsy ianao
He looks so crazy.	toa adala be izy
I still have other questions.	mbola manana fanontaniana hafa aho
This is a very difficult world.	tontolo sarotra be ity

We have ours.	manana ny anay izahay
It pays off.	mahazo vokatra izany
Good but not bad.	tsara fa tsy ratsy
It was harder to stay with that.	sarotra kokoa ny nijanona taminizany
You may have your own.	mety manana ny anao manokana ianao
Three types of activity were observed.	karazana hetsika telo no hita
Maybe he needs a little time too.	angamba mila fotoana kely ihany koa izy
What else.	inona indray
The house looks good.	toa tsara ilay trano
If only it could be true in real life.	raha mba ho tanteraka tokoa izany aminny tena fiainana
There were other problems as well.	nisy olana hafa koa
But, of course, that’s not what it is.	saingy mazava ho azy tsy inona izany

Now for the next thing.	ankehitriny ho anny zavatra manaraka
There are some problems there.	misy olana sasany any
Good, simple, easy to understand.	tsara tsotra mora azo
They come from all over.	avy aminny toerana rehetra izy ireo

This may seem very silly at first.	mety ho toa adala be izany aminny voalohany
Then, finally, it stopped.	avy eo farany nijanona
He looked good.	nijery tsara izy
They are happy with nothing.	faly tsy misy na inona na inona izy ireo
They did not go.	tsy nandeha izy ireo
With you on that too.	miaraka aminao aminizany koa
One day, they will come in large numbers.	indray andro any ho tonga maro be izy ireo
And it couldn’t be more accurate here.	ary tsy mety ho marina kokoa izany eto
This is another story.	tantara hafa indray ity
For us it was just beginning.	ho anny antsika dia vao nanomboka
Yes, they will go to a distant land.	eny ho any aminny tany lavitra izy
You now know about me.	fantatrao izao ny momba ahy
The money is not just there.	tsy ao fotsiny ny vola
All good things.	ny zavatra tsara rehetra
I think people can be the same way.	heveriko fa mety ho toy izany koa ny olona

Keep it simple, simple, simple.	ataovy tsotra tsotra tsotra
The best for you and yours.	ny tsara indrindra ho anao sy ny anao

I didn’t see it right away.	tsy hitako avy hatrany
Works all the time.	miasa aminny fotoana rehetra
And they are not wrong.	ary tsy diso izy ireo
That’s good, you know.	tsara izany fantatrao
I have always said that.	efa nilaza izany foana aho
Then he saw me.	dia nahita ahy izy
Yes, it is important.	eny zavadehibe izany
Apparently so.	toa izany tokoa no izy
You cannot do this work alone.	tsy afaka manao io asa io irery ianao
That seems to be true.	toa marina izany

Often, there is no time.	matetika tsy misy fotoana
Sometimes a big part.	indraindray ampahany lehibe
And maybe.	ary angamba
We’ve done all this before.	efa nanao izany rehetra izany izahay taloha

Maybe so too.	angamba izany koa
No one has seen anything like it.	tsy nisy nahita na inona na inona toy izany
Only one thing is certain.	zavatra iray ihany no azo antoka
It’s better if they don’t.	tsara kokoa raha tsy manao izany izy ireo
The past is all gone.	lasa daholo ny lasa
This one, however, seems to be designed to do more than that.	ity iray ity anefa dia toa natao hanao mihoatra noho izany
We really aren’t.	tena tsy izahay
But this is not difficult in itself.	tsy hoe sarotra aminny tenany anefa izany
You will know the type.	ho fantatrao ny karazana
But that is enough.	ampy ihany anefa izany

He knew her well.	fantany tsara izy
Two died.	roa no maty

Go see new people.	mandeha mijery olona vaovao

The next two, not the same.	ny roa manaraka tsy mitovy
And it’s hard.	ary sarotra izany
Then he saw them.	dia nahita azy ireo izy

That wasn’t really true, but we had no choice.	tsy tena marina izany saingy tsy nanana safidy izahay
You know you don’t even have to do that.	fantatrao fa tsy mila manao izany akory ianao
They had a lot of problems.	nanana olana maro izy ireo

I hope you did.	manantena aho fa nanao izany ianao
Sometimes for sure.	indraindray azo antoka

It’s just great.	izy io ihany no lehibe
But all of this is not easy.	tsy mora anefa izany rehetra izany

However, sometimes it happened.	na izany aza indraindray dia nisy izany
He thought about everything.	nieritreritra ny zavadrehetra izy
It's not bad.	tsy ratsy ilay izy
But even then, it doesn’t matter.	saingy na izany aza dia tsy zavadehibe

Make it fun.	ataovy mahafinaritra
Timing is the most important thing.	ny fotoana no tena zavadehibe
Perhaps in the past this was true.	angamba taminny lasa lavitra dia marina izany
I know you are right.	fantatro fa marina ny anao
But they work.	saingy miasa izy ireo
He really needed time for himself.	tena nila fotoana ho anny tenany izy
This is only one option.	safidy iray ihany ity
Some of them are great.	ny sasany aminizy ireo dia lehibe
Overall, a good day.	aminny ankapobeny andro tsara
It will come in time.	ho tonga aminny fotoana izany
Probably not easy.	tsy mora angamba
I can be what you want me to be.	afaka ny ho izay tianao ho ahy aho
It’s not about you.	tsy momba anao izany
I did the same.	nanao izany koa aho
There is a place for them.	misy toerana ho azy ireo
We will do it.	hanao izany isika
I never had that.	tsy nanana izany mihitsy aho
The problem seems too big.	toa lehibe loatra ny olana
It will not be difficult.	tsy ho sarotra izany
This is far bigger.	lehibe lavitra ity
They really needed me.	tena nila ahy izy ireo
A great one.	iray lehibe
And it makes sense.	ary misy dikany izany
No one did either.	tsy nisy nanao izany koa
She didn't even like the man.	tsy tiany akory ilay lehilahy
Yes, there is a war and it is ours.	eny misy ny ady ary antsika izany
Many of them.	betsaka aminizy ireo
He has always been dead.	efa maty foana izy
He seems really crazy when he does that.	toa adala tokoa rehefa manao izany izy
That’s the process and it works.	izany no dingana ary miasa
They can be whatever you want.	mety ho izay tianao izy ireo
Everything is instantaneous.	eo no ho eo ny zavadrehetra
Old new things may become familiar.	ny zavatra vaovao taloha dia mety ho lasa mahazatra
It’s a really fun place to be.	tena toerana mahafinaritra ho azy io
The good news is, they do.	ny vaovao tsara dia manao izany izy ireo
Maybe this is the right path.	angamba io no lalana marina
It can’t be too bad.	tsy mety ho ratsy be
But there was a big problem.	nisy olana lehibe anefa
But, it is not such a process.	saingy tsy dingana toy izany izany
They had a history.	nanana tantara izy ireo
I was finally free.	afaka ihany aho taminny farany
Men at work.	lehilahy miasa
But there are still problems here.	mbola misy olana ihany anefa eto
Then you couldn’t go far anymore.	dia tsy afaka nandeha lavitra intsony ianao
This work started well.	nanomboka tsara io asa io
I died anyway.	maty aho na izany aza
The choice, however, is simple.	ny safidy anefa dia tsotra
The car stopped nearby.	nijanona tsy lavitra teo ny fiara
Maybe too.	angamba ihany koa
She is just a woman.	vehivavy fotsiny izy
And the timing is right.	ary mety ny fotoana
Because it’s fun.	satria mahafinaritra
I have a big problem.	manana olana lehibe aho
That's it, he thought.	izany no izy hoy izy nieritreritra
You are a free man.	lehilahy afaka ianao
However, they went on a long journey.	na izany aza dia nandeha taminny dia lavitra izy ireo
There is a lot to do.	betsaka ny tsy maintsy atao
And they look at you and they know.	ary mijery anao izy ireo ary fantany
They are very wrong.	tena diso izy ireo
It needs only one problem.	mila olana iray ihany izany
There has never been such a process.	tsy mbola nisy dingana toy izany
And it's not right.	ary tsy mety izany
I wouldn’t be here otherwise.	tsy ho eto aho raha tsy izany
But it is not real.	tsy tena izy anefa
Good for them.	tsara ho azy ireo
I know he knows that too.	fantatro fa fantany izany koa
I need to look around more.	mila mijery manodidina bebe kokoa aho
But that is a mistake.	diso hevitra anefa izany
They are there again.	eo indray izy ireo
No option seems to be the best option.	tsy misy safidy toa ny safidy tsara indrindra
In fact, it has never been like that before.	raha ny marina dia mbola tsy nisy toy izany
Very different.	hafa be
And that's bad.	ary ratsy izany
In those days, it was nothing, you know.	taminizany andro izany dia tsy na inona na inona izany fantatrao
Maybe they are all.	angamba izy ireo rehetra ireo
They shouldn’t do that.	tsy tokony hanao izany izy ireo
They didn't need it from him.	tsy nila izany taminy izy ireo
There was something in it.	nisy zavatra tao anatiny
You can't be selfish in that.	tsy afaka ny ho tia tena aminizany ianao
I am a real woman.	tena vehivavy aho
Each of us.	isika tsirairay avy
I haven't seen him yet.	mbola tsy nahita azy aho
But I need more than that.	saingy mila mihoatra noho izany aho
They are not money.	tsy vola izy ireo
This game is really good.	ity lalao ity dia tena tsara
Do it.	manao izany
Look around you.	jereo ny manodidina anao
And from that comes the action.	ary avy aminizany dia misy ny hetsika
Three are gone.	telo no lasa
So do many people.	toy izany koa ny olona maro
Not just pictures, but everything.	tsy sary fotsiny fa ny rehetra
That's where it should be.	any no tokony hisy azy
They are right, individually.	marina izy ireo tsirairay avy
When we got there, nothing else was found.	rehefa tonga tany izahay dia tsy nisy zavatra hafa hita
I only want the truth about others.	ny marina momba ny hafa ihany no tiako
But that wasn’t the worst of it.	saingy tsy izany no ratsy indrindra taminizany
Of course, they didn’t stay the night.	mazava ho azy fa tsy nijanona ny alina izy ireo
He thought of drawing, but part of him said no.	nieritreritra ny hanao sary izy saingy nilaza ny ampahany taminy hoe tsia
That's the best.	izany no tsara indrindra
He was no more.	tsy teo intsony izy
Maybe there was really something else about the story.	angamba tena nisy zavatra hafa momba ilay tantara
There seems to be something missing.	toa misy zavatra tsy ampy
But he could be better now.	mety ho tsara kokoa anefa izy izao
And it doesn’t work.	ary tsy miasa
He, too.	izy ihany koa
It was really good for me.	tena tsara tamiko izany
When you have it, everything is easy.	rehefa manana izany dia mora daholo
Not good without it.	tsy mety raha tsy misy azy
And he will come soon.	ary ho avy tsy ho ela izy
It was no special event.	tsy nisy hetsika manokana izany
I have no idea about that.	tsy manana hevitra momba izany aho
I like him more now.	tiako kokoa izy izao
But he still had plenty of time.	mbola nanana fotoana be loatra anefa izy
Then he finally knew it.	avy eo dia fantany ihany izany
A conversation.	resaka iray
I don’t know if he could have done that.	tsy fantatro fa afaka nanao izany izy
He has a bigger problem.	manana olana lehibe kokoa izy
I will always be alone.	ho irery foana aho
They did not see him.	tsy nahita azy izy ireo
We can find a lot of time for that.	afaka mahita fotoana betsaka aminizany isika
Yes, it just doesn’t go away.	eny tsy mandeha fotsiny
There are so many fun things to do.	be dia be ny zavatra mahafinaritra atao
I did nothing for myself.	tsy nanao na inona na inona ho ahy aho
I have never been so happy before.	mbola tsy faly toy izany aho taloha
And that’s a lot more.	ary mbola betsaka kokoa izany
Things are possible, of course.	ny zavatra dia azo atao mazava ho azy
He’s too hard, of course.	mafy loatra izy mazava ho azy
Everything did not start well.	tsy nanomboka tsara ny zavadrehetra
So fun.	ka mahafinaritra
But it is good.	tsara anefa izany
You have no idea about it.	tsy manana hevitra momba izany ianao
I have no personal history.	tsy manana tantara manokana aho
The work is difficult.	sarotra ny asa
I’ve done a lot of work for you.	efa nanao asa betsaka ho anao aho
I've had enough.	efa ampy aho
Now it makes no sense to see that this is not possible.	tsy misy dikany izao ny mahita fa tsy azo atao izany
Surely you know about it.	azo antoka fa fantatrao ny momba izany
They are fun games.	lalao mahafinaritra izy ireo
You have to do something about it.	tsy maintsy manao zavatra momba izany ianao
It's not very good.	tsy dia tsara loatra izany
I can't do anything.	tsy afaka manao na inona na inona aho
Then they come faster and harder.	avy eo dia tonga haingana sy mafy kokoa izy ireo
There was work to be done.	nisy asa tsy maintsy natao
It’s not always the case.	tsy foana ilay izy
They said so.	nilaza izany izy ireo
It doesn't even make sense.	tsy misy dikany akory izany
Others, they like it.	ny hafa tiany izany
Very beautiful, as always.	tena tsara tarehy toy ny mahazatra
You should do this more often.	tokony hanao izany matetika kokoa ianao
You can see more and more closely.	afaka mahita akaiky kokoa hatrany ianao
He looked up immediately.	nijery avy hatrany izy
Better for me, of course.	tsara kokoa amiko mazava ho azy
Everyone is difficult.	sarotra ny tsirairay
Each bottom is different.	ny ambany tsirairay dia samy hafa
He will draw more pictures.	hanao sary bebe kokoa izy
This is not an idea.	tsy hevitra izany
The latter is for sure.	ity farany dia azo antoka
And he loves it.	ary tiany
I have that too.	manana izany koa aho
He didn’t like the idea of ​​me.	tsy tiany ilay hevitra momba ahy
Everything is as it should be.	ny zavadrehetra dia araka ny tokony ho izy
It doesn’t seem too far away.	toa tsy dia lavitra loatra izany
A lot now.	be dia be izao
But it doesn’t make sense.	saingy tsy misy dikany
It’s about what he likes.	momba ny zavatra tiany izany
It has to be something.	tsy maintsy zavatra izany
Not that, we are.	tsy hoe izahay
The problem is in the future.	ny olana dia aminny ho avy
You have to start today.	tsy maintsy manomboka anio ianao
We have something for everyone this year.	manana zavatra ho anny rehetra isika aminity taona ity
That is a question.	fanontaniana iray izany
I hope it comes anytime now.	manantena aho fa ho avy izany aminny fotoana rehetra izao
The important thing is not to think about it.	ny zavadehibe dia ny tsy nieritreritra momba izany
But he could have done something about it.	afaka nanao zavatra momba izany anefa izy
There is another problem.	misy olana hafa
However, for close work there was nothing better.	na izany aza ho anny asa akaiky dia tsy nisy tsara kokoa
And he always goes.	ary mandeha foana izy
Bad work.	asa ratsy
Keep working hard.	miasa mafy hatrany
You seem to have a problem.	toa manana olana ianao
For myself.	ho anny tena
There was a busy time at that time.	nisy fotoana be atao taminizany fotoana izany
And it is for all of us.	ary antsika rehetra izany
I know you have.	fantatro fa manana ianao
No one saw him again.	tsy nisy nahita azy intsony
Don’t start.	aza manomboka
I saw this fact in the following way.	hitako taminny fomba manaraka izany zavamisy izany
They are the same as before.	mitovy aminny taloha ihany izy ireo
I couldn’t go because of time.	tsy afaka nandeha aho noho ny fotoana
Although this is not possible.	na dia tsy azo atao aza izany
But it’s almost always time.	saingy efa saika fotoana foana izany
It is also beautiful.	izy io koa dia tsara tarehy
This is still wrong.	mbola diso izany
They are just confused.	very hevitra fotsiny izy ireo
I had it now.	nanana azy aho izao
It was as if he loved me.	toy ny hoe tia ahy izy
I know what.	fantatro hoe inona
It should come tonight.	tokony ho tonga aminny alina izao izany
The idea should be clear.	tokony ho hita mazava ny hevitra
He did well.	nanao tsara izy
Not so now.	tsy izany intsony ankehitriny
I love the place.	tiako ilay toerana
He knows the place.	fantany io toerana io
Sometimes, however, that is not the best.	indraindray anefa tsy izany no tsara indrindra
This is probably one of the best parts.	ity angamba no iray aminireo ampahany tsara indrindra
But it was too close to home.	saingy akaiky loatra ny trano izany
Basically I have time.	aminny ankapobeny dia manana fotoana aho
No, no, no question.	tsia tsia tsy misy fanontaniana
Far away.	eny lavitra eny
However, we still have the same problem.	na izany aza mbola manana olana mitovy ihany isika
I just love it.	tiako fotsiny ilay izy
No, it's not.	tsia tsy izany
There is a reason.	misy antony
There still seems to be something missing.	toa mbola misy zavatra tsy hita
We all thought well.	nieritreritra tsara izahay rehetra
I need to work on that.	mila miasa aminizany aho
No one saw them from below.	tsy nisy nahita azy ireo avy tany ambany
Probably, for many people.	angamba ho anny olona maro izany
We were all there.	teo daholo izahay
This place is for beginners.	ity toerana ity dia ho anny vao manomboka
He can see me up close.	afaka mahita ahy akaiky izy
Only bad things can come out of it.	zavatra ratsy ihany no mety ho avy aminizany
Still, it’s worth it.	na izany aza dia mendrika izany
Or it doesn’t work well.	na tsy miasa tsara
And it was fun.	ary nahafinaritra izany
She looked beautiful.	nijery tsara tarehy izy
This is below you.	ity dia ambany anao
They go well.	mandeha tsara izy ireo
This one is better.	ity iray ity dia tsara kokoa
All these kinds of things.	ireo karazana zavatra rehetra ireo
No, none of that today.	tsia tsy hisy aminireo aminizao andro izao
I would have done it if I hadn’t thought about it.	ho nanao izany aho raha tsy nieritreritra
No one owned the land.	tsy nisy nanana ny tany
But they still have to be found.	mbola tsy maintsy hita ihany anefa izy ireo
It must be something else.	tsy maintsy zavatra hafa izany
But there is much more to it than that.	saingy mihoatra lavitra noho izany
Just one of many.	iray ihany aminny maro
Maybe we can do it for her.	angamba afaka manao izany ho azy isika
One is correct.	marina ny iray
Someone came.	nisy olona tonga
Now he has to be a man for them.	aminizao fotoana izao dia tsy maintsy lehilahy ho azy ireo izy
It didn’t come from around here.	tsy avy teo akaiky teo izany
This is a crazy thing.	zavatra adala izany
We don’t need that here.	tsy mila izany isika eto
Although for sure.	na azo antoka aza
It was good, no one thought of war.	tsara ilay izy tsy nisy nieritreritra ny ady
Thank you so much for doing that.	misaotra betsaka anao nanao izany
It’s fun for him.	mahafinaritra azy izany
You can find them in two places.	afaka mahita azy ireo aminny toerana roa ianao
But the situation is somewhat different.	somary hafa ihany anefa ny zavamisy
Maybe no one will.	angamba tsy hisy hanao izany
He knows me well.	fantany tsara aho
I don't deserve the job.	tsy mendrika ny asa aho
I had time.	nanana fotoana aho
There was not enough in the last game.	nisy tsy ampy taminny lalao farany
You need age.	mila taona ianao
It made sense.	nisy dikany izany
So we went with it.	dia nandeha taminizany izahay
I really enjoy it !.	tena mahafinaritra ahy
But that is not all.	tsy izay ihany anefa
That’s it, in a way.	izay izy aminny fomba iray
A lot of people are unhappy.	betsaka ny olona tsy faly
It was a word he knew.	teny iray fantany izany
He knew no man would do that.	fantany fa tsy hisy lehilahy hanao izany
But there are still such problems.	saingy mbola misy olana toy izany
I find that very important.	hitako fa tena zavadehibe izany
He knew there would be no war tonight.	fantany fa tsy hisy ady anio alina
It’s really fun.	tena mahafinaritra tokoa izany
Yes, he likes it.	eny tiany izany
That's part of the problem.	ampahany aminny olana ihany izany
It’s one thing to do that.	zavatra iray ny manao izany
It’s a pointless job.	asa tsy misy dikany izany
We no longer have a private life.	tsy manana fiainana manokana intsony isika
It's all right .	ao tsara
Probably never will.	angamba tsy hanao izany mihitsy
They work in real time.	miasa aminny fotoana tena izy ireo
If you don’t want to be one.	raha tsy te ho iray ianao
He was meaningless.	tsy nisy dikany izy
And it may actually be lower than it should be.	ary mety ho ambany noho ny tokony ho izy izany raha ny marina
These women are a different matter.	resaka hafa mihitsy ireo vehivavy ireo
Thank you very much.	tena misaotra
But he was confused.	saingy very hevitra izy
Maybe something else.	angamba misy hafa
I thought about everything else.	nieritreritra ny zavatra hafa rehetra aho
But it was fun.	nahafinaritra anefa
Yes, from his stuff.	eny avy aminny zavatra azy
But this is not a bad thing.	tsy zavatra ratsy anefa izany
But you took too long to do that.	fa ela loatra ianao vao nanao izany
Yes, they still need it here.	eny mbola mila azy eto izy ireo
I think they love me.	heveriko fa tia ahy izy ireo
There is no reason for that.	tsy misy antony izany
Well, with food only.	eny ary miaraka aminny sakafo ihany
The age is really bad.	tena ratsy ny taona
It’s all very good.	tena tsara daholo izany
That’s the easy life, he said.	izany no fiainana mora hoy izy
I can’t have it, not yet.	tsy afaka manana izany aho tsy mbola
That might be good for you.	mety tsara aminao izany
They enjoyed doing wrong.	nahafinaritra azy ireo ny nanao ratsy
We should have been there.	tokony ho tany izahay
This is the hardest part.	izany no tena sarotra
Because otherwise we wouldn’t have seen them.	satria raha tsy izany dia tsy ho nahita azy ireo izahay
More than happy.	mihoatra noho ny faly
He was almost fine.	saika tsara izy
And she is very beautiful.	ary tena tsara tarehy izy
Not just mine.	tsy ny ahy fotsiny
It's not even that.	tsy izany akory no izy
The idea is this.	ny hevitra dia izao
Both are good.	samy tsara
You have to do a lot of work.	tokony hanao ny asa be
It must die, he said.	tsy maintsy maty io hoy izy
You know they exist.	fantatrao fa misy izy ireo
I think that’s fun.	heveriko fa mahafinaritra izany
They won’t do anything about it.	tsy hanao na inona na inona momba izany izy ireo
You know them.	fantatrao izy ireo
Work, but easy.	asa fa mora
But now all that is gone.	saingy aminizao fotoana izao dia tsy misy intsony izany rehetra izany
You can't do it anymore.	tsy afaka manao intsony ianao
It was really fun.	tena nahafinaritra tokoa izany
He also died.	maty koa izy
Maybe he was still there.	angamba mbola nisy izy
This is how everything is.	toy izao ny zavadrehetra
But then, not at all, really.	fa avy eo tsy izany mihitsy tena
It's mine.	ny ahy izany
Nice guy.	lehilahy mahafinaritra
Maybe not too far away.	angamba tsy mbola lavitra
The method is simple and safe.	ny fomba dia tsotra sy azo antoka
We and many others got it all.	nahazo izany rehetra izany izahay sy ny maro hafa
But that is the only idea.	izay ihany anefa no hevitra
There are many questions about it here.	misy fanontaniana maro momba izany eto
It should be easy for you.	tokony ho mora aminao izany
Or maybe not at all.	na mety tsy izany mihitsy
That’s a big thing.	zavatra lehibe izany
They will do good for him.	hanao ny tsara ho azy izy ireo
And you know too much.	ary fantatrao loatra koa
There are many such ways.	misy fomba maro toy izany
There is so much that can and must be done.	betsaka ny azo atao ary tsy maintsy atao
But nothing seems to work with them.	saingy toa tsy misy miasa aminizy ireo
He has never been well.	mbola tsy nandeha tsara mihitsy izy
That's three.	izay telo
He’s too good to be right.	tsara loatra izy ka tsy ho marina
The place is great.	mahafinaritra ny toerana
Some will be too small.	ny sasany dia ho kely loatra
This is true no matter how big the object.	marina izany na dia lehibe toy inona aza ilay zavatra
Good house.	trano tsara
He did not either.	tsy nanao izany koa izy
The place always seems to be.	toa foana ilay toerana
Then I am.	avy eo aho
I don’t know about it anymore.	tsy fantatro intsony ny momba izany
I didn’t do it, you know.	tsy nanao izany aho fantatrao
There were others.	nisy hafa koa
You are not even there.	tsy eo akory ianao
It’s all so much fun.	tena mahafinaritra daholo
One of the reasons, perhaps, for the trip.	ny iray aminireo antony angamba ho anny dia
Maybe once.	angamba indray mandeha
But this.	fa ity
You can still see some parts of the picture.	mbola afaka mahita ampahany sasany aminny sary ianao
It’s fast right now.	haingana izany aminizao fotoana izao
He had never done anything like that before.	mbola tsy nanao zavatra toy izany mihitsy izy taloha
But then he left.	saingy lasa izy avy eo
But this is the last time.	fa izao no fotoana farany
Everything he liked about her.	ny zavatra rehetra tiany momba azy
But that doesn't work for me either.	tsy mandeha koa anefa izany raha ny amiko
He is already a good man.	efa lehilahy tsara
But he is not.	tsy izany anefa izy
And you do.	ary manao izany ianao
There is nothing wrong with that.	tsy misy zavatra ratsy momba izany
He was probably a little confused.	somary very hevitra angamba izy
No, he doesn’t need it, he said.	tsia tsy mila izany izy hoy izy
And times are tough.	ary sarotra ny fotoana
They are more, now, than ever before.	mihoatra noho izany izy ireo ankehitriny noho ny teo aloha
When someone loves, someone loves.	rehefa misy tia dia misy tia
This is not the place.	tsy ity ny toerana
She loves him.	tia azy izy
Some are bigger than others.	ny sasany lehibe noho ny hafa
What is it, he said.	inona izany hoy izy
It's not like that.	tsy mba toy izany
And there are a lot of them.	ary be dia be izy ireo
It is now a home for him.	trano ho azy izao
These are different things.	zavatra samy hafa ireo
But it is lost.	saingy efa very izany
Now it is all fulfilled.	ankehitriny dia tanteraka izany rehetra izany
He may have been spotted.	mety efa hita izy
I don't get paid.	tsy mahazo vola aho
Too good for himself.	tsara loatra ho anny tenany
And it hasn't even gotten here yet.	ary mbola tsy tonga eto akory
But there are still problems.	mbola misy olana anefa
But it’s like he doesn’t see me.	fa toy ny hoe tsy mahita ahy izy
You know that.	fantatrao izany
The two are not the same.	tsy mitovy ny roa
This is absolutely wrong.	tena tsy mety mihitsy izany
There will be no other.	tsy hisy iray hafa
We need to make sure things are safe.	mila mahazo antoka isika fa ny zavatra dia azo antoka
There is no debate in it.	tsy misy ady hevitra ao
Yes, good question.	eny fanontaniana tsara
We are very high here.	any ambony be izahay eto
I don’t see much about him.	tsy dia hitako loatra ny momba azy
And so it will be.	ary izany no ho izany
Of course, he didn't.	mazava ho azy fa tsy nanao izany izy
He got one and two.	nahazo iray sy roa izy
I haven't looked yet.	tsy mbola nijery aho
Time passed.	nandeha ny fotoana
The choice to be free.	ny safidy ho afaka
It is real and very immediate.	tena misy izany ary tena eo no ho eo
We are very bad.	tena ratsy be izahay
There were no others.	tsy nisy koa ny hafa
You don't need me here.	tsy mila ahy eto ianao
It’s something else entirely.	zavatra hafa mihitsy izany
Then again, it may not be.	avy eo indray mety tsy izy
Well, now that’s too much, there.	eny ary izao dia be loatra izany teo
It has life.	manana fiainana izy io
But this is simply not true.	tsy marina tsotra izao anefa izany
I need two.	mila roa aho
It’s really not easy to follow the conversation.	tena tsy mora ny manaraka ny resaka
He is not here yet.	mbola tsy eto izy
He died almost immediately.	saika maty teo no ho eo izy
Nothing should, but someone does.	tsy misy tokony fa misy manao
Maybe one day.	indray andro angamba
And what a day it was.	ary andro inona izany
He said he had.	nilaza izy fa nanana
I have a problem with people like that.	manana olana aminny olona toy izany aho
But he was not like that.	tsy nisy toy izany anefa izy
But not at the same time.	tsy aminny fotoana iray ihany anefa
Not fun here.	tsy mahafinaritra eto
Everything at the wrong time.	ny zavadrehetra aminny fotoana tsy mety
You die today.	maty ianao anio
You should never do that.	tsy tokony hanao izany mihitsy ianao
In fact, we always will.	hanao foana isika raha ny marina
I don’t have any of that anymore.	tsy misy amiko intsony izany rehetra izany
Lots of words in it.	teny maro ao
He traveled often.	nandeha matetika izy
Everything went well, it was just a long way off.	nandeha tsara ny zavadrehetra dia lavitra fotsiny
Maybe the war.	angamba ny ady
Sometimes even that person is very insecure.	indraindray aza io olona io dia tena tsy azo antoka
A game of a game is well worth it.	ny lalao iray aminny lalao iray dia mendrika be
He had it.	nanana izany izy
It’s really hard.	tena mafy tokoa izany
It couldn't even be done.	tsy azo natao akory izany
Clearly, they are both.	mazava fa samy izy io
Check out recent events.	jereo ny hetsika vao haingana
Need the full story again.	mila ny tantara feno indray
Everyone can do without.	ny olona rehetra dia afaka manao tsy misy
We drove two cars.	nandeha fiara roa izahay
The word went.	nandeha ny teny
I have this whole earth.	manana izao tany rehetra izao aho
So don’t expect anything else.	koa aza manantena zavatra hafa
About the money, of course.	momba ny vola mazava ho azy
This is a good time.	fotoana tsara izao
On the first day at some point.	aminny andro voalohany aminny fotoana sasany
That is, they either don’t know either.	izany hoe na tsy fantany na
But there may be a faster way.	saingy mety misy fomba haingana kokoa
It really should be.	tokony ho izany tokoa
People just do things.	manao zavatra fotsiny ny olona
The work there was always different.	hafa foana ny asa tany
Maybe they didn’t see any other stories.	angamba izy ireo tsy nahita tantara hafa
Yes, very good.	eny tena tsara
This is not a trivial matter.	tsy zavatra tsy misy dikany izany
The words may be different.	mety ho samy hafa ny teny
You are bad.	ratsy ianao
This is also a fact.	izany koa dia zavamisy
The night went by.	nandeha ny alina
I don't like him.	tsy tiako izy
The problem is the following.	ny olana dia izao manaraka izao
There are people like that.	misy olona toy izany
Yes and that is how it should be.	eny ary izany no tokony ho izy
But you are different.	fa hafa ianao
Don’t talk too much about it.	aza be resaka momba izany
I love that too.	tiako koa izany
Easy to understand, safe.	mora azo azo antoka
Just do it.	ataovy fotsiny izany
Just like this.	toy izao fotsiny
It doesn’t go far.	tsy mandeha lavitra izany
This works in a very different way.	izany dia miasa aminny fomba tena hafa
And you know that.	ary fantatrao izany
This seems normal.	toa mahazatra izany
However, in my case, it is not.	na izany aza raha ny amiko dia tsy izany
But that is a story for another day !.	izany anefa dia tantara ho anny andro hafa
Now, this is a very small place.	ankehitriny ity dia toerana tena kely
I'm not good enough at all.	tsy ampy tsara mihitsy aho
But if he did.	fa raha nanao izany izy
There is no game unless we are together.	tsy misy lalao raha tsy miaraka isika
I love the type.	tiako ilay karazana
It’s not perfect.	tsy tanteraka izany
It may seem like nothing else.	mety ho toy ny hoe tsy misy hafa
There was still a lot of money in the past.	mbola betsaka ny vola teo aloha
I don’t like them either.	tsy tiako koa izy ireo
I love going crazy.	tiako ny lasa adala
He had never seen her like that before.	mbola tsy nahita azy toy izany mihitsy izy
To me, it didn’t make sense.	amiko dia tsy nisy dikany izany
They are now his favorite.	izy ireo izao no tena tiany
The results are almost completely bad.	saika ratsy tanteraka ny vokatra
Always happy to see him.	faly foana nahita azy
I don't need it anymore.	tsy mila intsony aho
Now that doesn’t seem to work anymore.	ankehitriny dia toa tsy mandeha intsony izany
It has to be first.	tsy maintsy ho voalohany
It should be fun, but it’s not.	tokony ho mahafinaritra izany fa tsy izany
You are here again.	efa eto indray ianao
But that doesn’t seem to be the case.	saingy toa tsy izany no izy
You know, one of those.	fantatrao iray aminireo
We all have it.	samy manana izany isika rehetra
It’s hard to get it.	sarotra ny mahazo azy
This is not true of me.	tsy marina izany amiko
Which is a really good thing.	izay zavatra tena tsara
Worth it all.	mendrika izany rehetra izany
That's what it did.	izany no nanao izany
This is the reality because they exist.	toy izao ny zavamisy satria misy izy ireo
It all doesn’t seem right, it doesn’t work for me.	toa tsy mety daholo tsy mety amiko
It will still be seen today.	mbola ho hita izany anio
And then nothing.	ary avy eo tsy misy na inona na inona
However, this method is generally feasible.	na izany aza ity fomba ity dia azo atao aminny ankapobeny
However, this did not happen.	tsy tanteraka anefa izany
That is the general idea.	izany no hevitra ankapobeny
See it for yourself.	jereo ho anao izany
But they can also be very wrong.	mety ho diso hevitra be koa anefa izy ireo
But it’s up there.	fa any ambony io
That seems like a good result.	toa vokatra tsara izany
I'm a bad guy.	lehilahy ratsy aho
From him.	avy eo aminy
This is uncertain.	tsy azo antoka izany
But there never was.	saingy tsy nisy mihitsy
This word is not always true.	tsy marina foana io teny io
It wasn’t very fun.	tsy dia nahafinaritra loatra izany
Three did not come.	telo tsy nisy tonga
Both said no.	samy nilaza hoe tsia
He may be right, as usual.	mety ho marina izy toy ny mahazatra
You are not his.	tsy azy ianao
But not too much.	fa tsy be loatra
The question in them was clear.	mazava ny fanontaniana tao aminizy ireo
But if he can't be superior.	fa raha tsy afaka ny ho ambony izy
Which is fun too.	izay mahafinaritra koa
And maybe he has done it more than once.	ary angamba efa nanao izany mihoatra ny indray mandeha izy
He is currently missing.	tsy hita izy aminizao fotoana izao
Some may be faster.	mety ho haingana kokoa ny sasany
He can't disagree with her.	tsy afaka tsy mitovy hevitra aminy izy
That is enough.	izay dia ampy
The night was harder.	sarotra kokoa ny alina
We need more like you.	mila bebe kokoa toa anao izahay
They don't need us.	tsy mila antsika izy ireo
I had to think carefully.	tsy maintsy nieritreritra tsara aho
Too fun.	mahafinaritra loatra
Otherwise, everything else is meaningless.	raha tsy izany ny zavatra hafa rehetra dia tsy misy dikany
Lots of possibilities !.	betsaka ny mety
No problem for me.	tsy misy olana amiko
Good to have you here.	tsara ny manana anao eto
Not by type, not by choice.	tsy aminny karazana tsy aminny safidy
I have a similar problem.	manana olana mitovy aminizany aho
You have to have an idea.	tsy maintsy manana hevitra ianao
Just do it now.	ataovy fotsiny izao
Find a new place.	mahita toerana vaovao
Apparently no one could have done anything else.	toa tsy nisy olona afaka nanao zavatra hafa
But even so, it is not enough.	saingy na dia toy izany aza dia tsy ampy izany
And, for good reason.	ary noho ny antony tsara
He doesn't love me.	tsy tia ahy izy
It probably has to be.	tsy maintsy ho izany angamba
Please lose it.	mba very izany
As they should be.	toy ny tokony ho izy ireo
Really unpleasant.	tena tsy mahafinaritra
Where there is.	izay misy
You can find some here.	afaka mahita sasany eto ianao
Finally the big day came.	farany dia tonga ny andro lehibe
You are not wrong in any of this.	tsy diso ianao aminizany rehetra izany
Not all women, of course.	tsy ny vehivavy rehetra mazava ho azy
Either way, he’s bad.	na izany na tsy izany ratsy izy
For real.	tena izy
No one did that.	tsy nisy nanao izany izy ireo
And the reality is obvious.	ary mazava ho azy ny zavamisy
And there we were.	ary teo no nisy anay
Now the fun part.	ankehitriny ny ampahany mahafinaritra
They are the only two worlds.	izy roa ihany no izao tontolo izao
That seems very clear.	toa mazava be izany
That is how we are today.	toy izany isika ankehitriny
We shouldn’t have been there before.	tsy tokony ho tany aloha isika
This is for two main reasons.	izany dia noho ny antony roa lehibe
He would not be much better off alone.	tsy ho tsara lavitra koa izy raha irery
But he is not right for you.	tsy mety aminao mihitsy anefa izy
It is impossible to do good.	tsy azo atao ny manao zavatra tsara
Not yet, he told himself.	tsy mbola hoy izy taminny tenany
I enjoy traveling long distances.	mahafinaritra ahy ny mandeha lavitra
But they are a little wrong.	diso kely anefa izy ireo
People die.	maty ny olona
If you haven’t watched it yet, do it right away.	raha mbola tsy nijery azy ianao dia ataovy avy hatrany
He had to go and see.	tsy maintsy nandeha nijery izy
I came to see you.	tonga nijery anao aho
I know these people, and they really love me.	fantatro ireo olona ireo ary tena tia ahy izy ireo
Too bad.	ratsy loatra
But not dead.	fa tsy maty
I have to get them and then.	tsy maintsy mahazo azy ireo aho ary avy eo
Not many, but some.	tsy maro fa ny sasany
See, it’s just hard.	jereo fa sarotra ihany izany
That’s a lot of money, no question.	vola be izany tsy misy fanontaniana
Too much of everything.	be loatra ny zavadrehetra
See if anything comes out of it.	jereo raha misy zavatra avy aminizany
I became a man that year.	lasa lehilahy aho taminizany taona izany
He is a very good person.	tena olona tsara izy
The man did so.	nanao izany ilay lehilahy
And many other things.	ary zavatra maro hafa
I hope they are not.	manantena aho fa tsy izany izy ireo
We have a lot of you.	be dia be aminao izahay
It's all wrong.	diso daholo izany
He did a great job.	nanao asa lehibe izy
We are not there right now.	tsy misy izahay aminizao fotoana izao
He seems to be a safe man.	toa olona azo antoka izy
Always new.	vaovao foana
For us, things are not alone.	ho antsika dia tsy misy irery ny zavatra
These men are you.	ireo lehilahy ireo dia ianao
There was a really good idea in it.	nisy hevitra tena tsara tao anatiny
You can have it if you want.	afaka manana izany ianao raha tianao
Women are better than that.	ny vehivavy dia tsara kokoa noho izany
It went well.	lasa tsara izany
So, even a little, it makes a little more sense.	noho izany na dia kely aza dia misy dikany kely kokoa
There is no such thing.	tsy misy toy izany
There was no bad trip.	tsy nisy dia ratsy
However, time passed.	na izany aza nandeha ny fotoana
I’m really good at it.	tena tsara ho ahy tokoa aho
It’s hard for him.	sarotra aminy izany
This is not the way either.	tsy izany koa ny fomba
He is dead and gone.	efa maty ary lasa
I think so, and hope so.	heveriko fa izany ary manantena izany
It's too fast.	haingana loatra izany
I can still see good things.	mbola afaka mahita zavatra tsara aho
They are in one and two.	ao aminny iray sy roa izy ireo
It's all yours.	anao daholo izy
But they can't.	saingy tsy afaka izy ireo
This is true of people and places.	marina izany momba ny olona sy ny toerana
This is absolutely true.	marina tanteraka izany
And yes, the words are beautiful.	ary eny mahafinaritra ny teny
Nice little car.	fiara kely tsara tarehy
But it’s great.	saingy lehibe izany
Words will not come.	tsy ho avy ny teny
It may seem trivial.	mety ho toa tsy misy dikany izany
I have never done that before.	mbola tsy nanao toy izany mihitsy aho
I would have done the same.	ho nanao toy izany koa aho
There is nothing to it.	tsy misy na inona na inona aminizany
He didn't have it.	tsy nanana izany izy
I will not always be there.	tsy ho eo foana aho
But more is needed.	mbola betsaka kokoa anefa no ilaina
No one is stupid.	tsy misy manao adala
You need to do it.	mila manao izany
There is something wrong with the money.	misy zavatra tsy mety aminny vola
You will be wrong.	ho diso hevitra ianao
From people cars, that is.	avy aminny olona fiara izany hoe
you are alone.	irery ianao
He had no one.	tsy nanana olona izy
Or, maybe they are.	na angamba izy ireo
It is real.	tena misy izany
So we were there.	ka teo tokoa izahay
He is more than that.	mihoatra noho izany izy
I deserve it too.	mendrika izany koa aho
And there are other options.	ary misy safidy hafa
And they are not alone.	ary tsy izy ireo ihany
I really want to do more.	tena te hanao zavatra bebe kokoa aho
And all that now.	ary izany rehetra izany aminizao fotoana izao
He is there.	ao izy
I want to go there too.	te ho any koa aho
Some a lot, some just a little.	ny sasany be ny sasany kely fotsiny
But the road is difficult.	sarotra anefa ny lalana
Because these are the best days.	satria ireo no andro tsara indrindra
Better than before.	tsara kokoa noho ny teo aloha
Some will not.	tsy hanao izany ny sasany
I must disagree with you.	tsy maintsy tsy mitovy hevitra aminao aho
But this is very difficult.	sarotra be anefa izany
It is still very new.	mbola vaovao be ilay izy
That's all there is now.	izay ihany no misy ankehitriny
He is happy when he is alone.	faly izy rehefa irery
Very good, very happy.	tena tsara tena faly
No, you are probably right.	tsia marina angamba ianao
Each day has its own problems.	ny andro tsirairay dia manana olana manokana
Something nonsensical.	zavatra tsy misy dikany
I think it will still come.	heveriko fa mbola ho avy
But it’s not that simple.	saingy tsy dia tsotra loatra izany
All the news.	ny vaovao rehetra
I had thought about everything.	efa nieritreritra ny zavadrehetra aho
I never miss a date.	tsy diso andro mihitsy aho
I haven't been there yet.	mbola tsy tany aho
Then you are wrong.	dia diso ianao
Whatever it takes at the time, you can do it.	na inona na inona ilaina aminny fotoana dia azonao atao izany
If this is true, then so be it.	raha marina izany dia izay tokoa
That is, you don’t really need them.	izany hoe tsy tena mila azy ireo
Do it and nothing else.	ataovy izany ary tsy misy hafa
I know it's not you.	fantatro fa tsy anao izany
Such is life.	toy izany ny fiainana
One person died.	olona iray no maty
There is nothing difficult about that.	tsy misy zavatra sarotra aminizany
This is only partially true.	marina aminny ampahany ihany izany
I always knew him.	fantatro hatrany izy
We have many problems.	manana olana maro isika
Finally, age is often the reason.	farany ny taona dia matetika no antony
Far more than he knew.	lavitra kokoa noho izay fantany
There is nothing out of the ordinary there.	tsy misy zavatra tsy mahazatra indrindra any
There are two options here.	misy safidy roa eto
And now that seems to be true.	ary aminizao fotoana izao dia toa marina izany
We do the following.	manao izao manaraka izao izahay
I looked at him immediately.	nijery azy avy hatrany aho
This is the simplest.	izany no tsotra indrindra
See something else.	mahita zavatra hafa
Not often but sometimes.	tsy matetika fa indraindray
It’s a lost cause.	antony very izany
But there is a problem with it.	saingy misy olana iray aminy
People love good and bad.	ny olona tia ny tsara sy ny ratsy
But it’s a good idea.	saingy hevitra tsara izany
But you are too far away.	lavitra be anefa ianao eto
Just like time itself.	toy ny fotoana mihitsy
And for not a lot of money.	ary noho ny tsy vola be
He should have been happy about it.	tokony ho faly izy taminizany
You have already said that.	efa nilaza izany ianao izao
But it will become so.	fa ho lasa toy izany
It’s gone now.	lasa izany ankehitriny
The problem is that’s all you get.	ny olana dia izay ihany no azonao
That was the most fun thing about the game.	izany no zavatra nahafinaritra indrindra taminny lalao
They are all very good.	tena tsara izy rehetra
They started right away.	nanomboka avy hatrany izy ireo
But that doesn’t seem to make much sense.	saingy toa tsy dia misy dikany loatra izany
It’s all the same.	mitovy daholo izany
Everything is going well.	mandeha ny zavadrehetra
You don’t have to get it.	tsy mila mahazo izany ianao
Really, really love it.	tena tena tia
The game seems real.	toa tena misy ny lalao
This is very cheap money.	ity dia vola mora be
And they are all selfish and beautiful, in fact.	ary izy rehetra dia tia tena sy tsara tarehy raha ny marina
They can get it faster and easier.	afaka mahazo izany haingana sy mora kokoa izy ireo
There, he said.	teo hoy izy
Some may be happy with that.	ny sasany angamba faly aminizany
And the news is great.	ary ny vaovao dia lehibe
But he didn’t say, or couldn’t say.	saingy tsy nilaza izy na tsy afaka nilaza
And of course you can't.	ary mazava ho azy fa tsy afaka
In the news.	ao aminny vaovao
No one is here yet.	tsy mbola misy olona eto
They were real, of course.	tena nisy izy ireo mazava ho azy
It's just a word.	teny fotsiny io
They both got it.	samy nahazo azy ireo
There is a clear way around this problem.	misy fomba iray mazava manodidina ity olana ity
He had to do it himself.	tsy maintsy nanao izany ny tenany
Both options should be good.	ireo safidy roa ireo dia tokony ho tsara
But then, it’s meant to be.	fa avy eo dia natao ho
Maybe we can find another job.	angamba afaka mahita asa hafa isika
I want you to like it too.	tiako fa tianao koa izany
It was done.	natao izany
There are no facts.	tsy misy zavamisy
No one saw.	tsy nisy nahita
And he didn't need it.	ary tsy nila izany izy
I will not do anything to them.	tsy hanao na inona na inona aminizy ireo aho
Some people love them.	misy olona tia azy ireo
But that is not the case.	tsy izany anefa no izy
So you saw him.	ka nahita azy ianao
The other night I couldn’t.	ny alina hafa dia tsy afaka
Or do it now.	na ataovy izao
But for once, it’s been a long time.	fa indray mandeha efa ela
This is the big part.	ity no ampahany lehibe
She is a wonderful woman.	vehivavy mahafinaritra izy
Unless they don’t know too.	raha tsy hoe tsy fantany koa
I think it could have been better.	heveriko fa mety ho tsara kokoa izany
Maybe he was too stupid to do it.	adala loatra angamba izy ka tsy afaka nanao izany
This story is not new to me.	tsy vaovao tamiko ity tantara ity
Same story.	io tantara io ihany
But that doesn’t usually work.	tsy mandeha anefa izany matetika
He sees something.	mahita zavatra izy
However, everything went so well that it would not be true.	na izany aza ny zavadrehetra dia nandeha tsara loatra ka tsy ho marina
She loved seeing him there.	tiany ny nahita azy tany
I think it is possible.	heveriko fa azo atao izany
It may be a matter of time.	mety ho resaka fotoana izany
But they did not.	tsy nanao izany anefa izy ireo
And all three are great.	ary izy telo ireo dia lehibe
They often are.	matetika izy ireo
I think you are a good man.	heveriko fa lehilahy tsara ianao
But all this is not enough.	mbola tsy ampy anefa izany rehetra izany
There is no place at all.	tsy misy toerana mihitsy
As always it’s mostly about photography.	toy ny mahazatra dia matetika momba ny sary
He alone could tell.	izy irery no afaka nilaza
You are not completely wrong.	tsy diso tanteraka ianao
There was a problem.	teo ny olana
I prefer the good.	tiako kokoa ny tsara
I don’t think he would ever do that.	heveriko fa tsy hanao izany mihitsy izy
Yes, we have and we don’t have.	eny manana isika ary tsy manana
This work is so much fun.	mahafinaritra be ity asa ity
It may be a small world.	tontolo kely angamba ilay izy
It is difficult for them.	sarotra aminizy ireo izany
In fact, this is the only essential part.	raha ny marina io ihany no ampahany tena ilaina
They needed him, but they didn’t need me.	nila azy izy ireo fa tsy nila ahy
I just need a little time.	mila fotoana kely fotsiny aho
The question is if so.	ny fanontaniana dia raha ho izany
He died but did not die.	maty izy fa tsy maty
They may not be safe for everyone.	mety tsy ho azo antoka ho anny rehetra izy ireo
Yes, they don’t.	eny tsy manao izany izy ireo
They need to look at them all.	mila mijery azy rehetra izy ireo
No problem, yet.	tsy misy olana mbola
In fact, he is the farthest thing from a fool.	raha ny marina izy no zavatra lavitra indrindra aminny adala
We both thought.	samy nieritreritra izahay
There was something wrong.	nisy ny ratsy
Most of all, it’s just a fun, fun game.	indrindra indrindra lalao mahafinaritra mahafinaritra fotsiny izy io
He will love them.	ho tiany izy ireo
These are the options.	ireo no safidy
Or a problem with the car.	na olana aminny fiara
But she is beautiful.	tsara tarehy anefa izy
Many of them in fact.	maro aminizy ireo raha ny marina
It may be, but sometimes it isn’t.	mety ho izany fa indraindray tsy izany
So, for them it will be difficult.	noho izany ho azy ireo dia ho sarotra
He said it was tonight.	nilaza izy fa anio alina no alina
He still likes it.	mbola tiany izany
The past was meaningless.	ny lasa lavitra dia tsy nisy dikany
But he knew something.	nisy zavatra fantany anefa
He should have stayed there.	tokony nijanona teo izy
It's two nights.	roa alina izany
However, the story can also be complex.	na izany aza ny tantara dia mety ho sarotra ihany koa
Many came, of all kinds.	betsaka ireo tonga samy hafa karazana
So we went on.	dia nandeha hatrany izahay
He doesn’t have much to lose.	tsy manana zavatra betsaka ho very izy
Not available.	tsy misy
Good work.	tsara ny asa
This is also new.	vaovao koa izany
So, really stupid.	noho izany tena adala
He had many options.	nanana safidy maro izy
Don’t do more than that.	aza atao mihoatra noho izay izy io
Come easy and go easy.	tonga mora dia mandeha mora
Both are better.	tsara kokoa ny roa
We have all the time in the world.	manana ny fotoana rehetra eto aminizao tontolo izao isika
If he did, the question would be closer.	raha nanao izany izy dia ho akaiky kokoa ny fanontaniana
However, nothing is completely certain.	na izany aza tsy misy azo antoka tanteraka
I had to think about it.	tsy maintsy nieritreritra izany aho
He saw two.	nahita roa izy
This is a trivial question.	fanontaniana tsy misy dikany izany
They may be far away.	mety ho any lavitra izy ireo
He didn't think.	tsy nieritreritra izy
But that is not at all the case.	tsy izany mihitsy anefa no zavamisy
You've just been seen again.	vao hita indray ianao
There is no history of previous wars on the issue.	tsy misy tantara momba ny ady teo aloha momba ny olana
Very good job.	asa tena tsara
Whatever is needed.	na inona na inona ilaina
And we have to have it.	ary tsy maintsy manana izany isika
Very little indeed.	tena kely tokoa
He is still too far away.	mbola lavitra loatra izy
This is a big problem.	olana lehibe izany
It was not easy to find a great place.	tsy mora ny nahita toerana lehibe
Simple is often best.	ny tsotra no tsara indrindra matetika
He just can’t do it to me.	tsy afaka manao izany amiko fotsiny izy
Still possible.	mbola mety
He had two ideas.	nanana hevitra roa izy
The process is never difficult.	tsy sarotra mihitsy ilay fomba
There seem to be two main reasons for the game.	toa misy antony roa lehibe aminny lalao
And look.	ary jereo
So you will be a good thing in life.	ka ho zavatra tsara eo aminny fiainana ianao
Maybe it has already happened.	efa nisy toy izany angamba izao
They act like the above.	manao toy ny ambony izy ireo
We can go very fast.	afaka mandeha haingana be izahay
But it will not come here.	tsy ho tonga eto anefa izany
To begin with never begins.	ny manomboka eo dia tsy manomboka mihitsy
But he did not seem happy.	toa tsy faly anefa izy
And he’s not good for himself.	ary tsy tsara ho anny tenany izy
It was not fun.	tsy nahafinaritra ilay izy
Then there is a time.	dia misy fotoana
In action, of course.	aminny hetsika mazava ho azy
You made good money.	nahazo vola tsara ianao
It’s a choice.	safidy izany
Don't go where you don't want to be.	aza any aminny toerana tsy tianao hisy mihitsy
He’s not stupid, no.	tsy adala izy tsia
Maybe it’s always time.	angamba fotoana foana izany
They were so busy that they couldn’t do much more.	be atao loatra izy ireo ka tsy afaka nanao zavatra betsaka kokoa
And it doesn’t seem to be that good anymore.	ary toa tsy dia tsara intsony izany
Now that must make sense.	ankehitriny dia tsy maintsy misy dikany izany
Yes, work is a good thing.	eny zavatra tsara ny asa
Yes, it is, of course.	eny izany no izy mazava ho azy
But then they stopped.	nijanona anefa izy ireo avy eo
It makes sense again.	misy dikany indray izany
It could be easier.	mety ho mora kokoa izany
He certainly didn’t have it himself.	azo antoka fa tsy nanana ny tenany izy
Come and be done.	tonga ary tanteraka
You said you looked at him.	nilaza ianao fa nijery azy ianao
He doesn’t need to have.	tsy mila manana izy
I look forward to the future.	manantena ny ho avy aho
He doesn’t do that very often.	tsy manao izany matetika izy
The best of both worlds.	ny tsara indrindra aminny tontolo roa
It was as if they were alone.	toy ny hoe irery izy ireo
No, he really is.	tsia izy mihitsy
Some got things too small, some too big.	ny sasany nahazo zavatra kely loatra ny sasany lehibe loatra
One of these types.	iray aminireo karazana ireo
And that's not really true.	ary tsy tena marina izany
I really don’t like that.	tena tsy tiako izany
The man died.	maty ilay lehilahy
It's right for you.	mety aminao izany
I really like it.	tena tiako
We really need that.	tena mila izany izahay
Of these, land is the most important.	aminireo ny tany no zavadehibe kokoa
He was too young to die.	mbola kely loatra izy no maty
Of course not.	mazava ho azy fa tsy tokony
Yes, happy, of course.	eny faly mazava ho azy
Not for us.	tsy ho antsika
He is not.	tsy izy
Some do it in a trivial way.	ny sasany dia manao izany aminny fomba tsy dia misy dikany
And many years ago.	ary taona maro lasa izay
And maybe they had.	ary angamba nanana izy ireo
Hard and tough.	mafy sy mafy
It’s all always there.	foana daholo izany
You don’t get it first.	tsy azonao aloha
I will do anything.	hanao na inona na inona aho
We are happy to watch them.	faly izahay mijery azy ireo
But one last thing.	fa zavatra iray farany
Of course, such a thing is meaningless.	mazava ho azy fa tsy misy dikany ny zavatra toy izany
No more cars came.	tsy nisy fiara tonga intsony
Yes, he himself is a fool.	eny ny tenany mihitsy no adala
It didn’t seem to exist.	toa tsy nisy izany
If you saw something.	raha nahita zavatra ianao
Women.	ny vehivavy
They always have fun activities.	manana hetsika mahafinaritra foana izy ireo
But the next step is easy.	mora anefa ny manaraka
He was very honest about it.	tena nanao ny marina momba izany izy
These are all facts.	zavamisy daholo ireo
I always love the impossible.	tiako foana ny tsy azo atao
There was no one on the ground.	tsy nisy olona teo aminny tany
Not such a thing.	tsy zavatra toy izany
But getting the job was difficult.	sarotra anefa ny nahazo ilay asa
There is a simple reason.	misy antony tsotra izao
Yes, there is a man.	eny misy lehilahy iray
He really loves us and he really loves us.	tena tia antsika izy ary tena tia antsika
You can do crazy things when it’s like that.	afaka manao zavatra adala ianao rehefa toy izany
In fact, there are two problems here.	raha ny marina dia misy olana roa eto
However, we have come a long way in that.	na izany aza efa lasa lavitra isika aminizany
So that seems to make sense to me.	noho izany dia toa misy dikany izany amiko
I think, it’s completely different.	heveriko fa dia hafa mihitsy
They saw nothing like it.	tsy nahita na inona na inona toy izany izy ireo
It’s just so full.	tena feno ihany
He needed more time.	nila fotoana bebe kokoa izy
We both did the same job.	samy nanao asa mitovy izahay
Nothing is just simple.	tsy misy zavatra tsotra fotsiny
No need to be clear.	tsy mila mazava
He knew, he said.	fantany hoy izy
Often the self.	matetika ny tena
You can, you know.	azonao atao fantatrao
It’s not real at all.	tsy tena izy mihitsy
I was glad to be there.	faly aho tonga teo
But there are other times when it doesn’t.	saingy misy fotoana hafa tsy misy
Maybe they can’t.	angamba tsy afaka izy ireo
And this is another one.	ary ity dia iray hafa
That’s probably the word.	izany angamba no teny
This idea is not new at all.	tsy vaovao mihitsy io hevitra io
Yes, here we are.	eny eto isika
The problem is the same.	ny olana dia mitovy
They are important to me.	zavadehibe amiko izy ireo
Certainly not possible.	azo antoka fa tsy azo atao izany
It's been a long time coming.	efa ela no nisy
We don’t have much but that’s true.	tsy manana be loatra isika fa marina izany
It’s not possible, but this place seems familiar.	tsy azo atao izany saingy toa mahazatra azy io toerana io
He didn't look down.	tsy nijery ambany izy
They are still together.	mbola miaraka izy ireo
I know it’s hard.	fantatro fa sarotra izany
In fact, he may be right.	raha ny marina mety marina ny azy
That’s where I am, actually.	eo ny toerana misy ahy raha ny marina
I don’t have, I will never do that.	tsy manana aho tsy hanao izany mihitsy
I and many others did.	nanao izany aho sy ny maro hafa
We do not walk alone.	tsy mandeha irery izahay
You used to be.	taloha ianao
Nothing seems clearer.	tsy misy toa mazava kokoa
This effect is small.	kely io vokatra io
But right now it’s really crazy.	fa aminizao fotoana izao dia tena adala
Worse than that.	ratsy kokoa noho izany
But of course this is not true.	saingy mazava ho azy fa tsy marina izany
In fact, all of this is nonsense.	raha ny marina dia zavatra tsy misy dikany izany rehetra izany
And he goes even further than that.	ary lasa lavitra kokoa noho izany aza izy
Or he can’t be hard.	na tsy afaka ny mafy izy
I’m like in the end actually.	toy ny aminny farany aho raha ny marina
We had nothing then.	tsy nanana na inona na inona izahay taminizany
Wherever you can.	aminny toerana rehetra azonao atao
They are bad.	ratsy izy ireo
And some died.	ary nisy maty
He is often free.	matetika izy no afaka
He is all around you.	manodidina anao izy
But he saw nothing of it.	saingy tsy nahita na inona na inona momba izany izy
Better man, if you will.	lehilahy tsara kokoa raha tianao
They are alone now.	irery izy ireo aminizao fotoana izao
When you want.	rehefa tianao
And it went straight to him.	ary nandeha avy hatrany taminy izany
He couldn't even look at her.	tsy afaka nijery azy akory izy
But this is not necessary.	tsy tena ilaina anefa izany
And maybe he told me that.	ary angamba izy no nilaza izany tamiko
It might make more sense.	mety hisy dikany kokoa izany
It doesn't seem to be his.	toa tsy azy izany
Both still see.	mbola samy mahita
There are so many other things.	be dia be ny zavatra hafa
I don’t like it very much.	tsy dia tiako loatra izany
I was lost too.	very koa aho
I still think that’s not an option.	mbola heveriko fa tsy safidy izany
More important than anything else.	zavadehibe kokoa noho ny zavatra hafa rehetra
Old people.	olona taloha
It is important even if they are not very common.	tena zavadehibe na dia tsy dia mahazatra loatra aza izy ireo
Great time overall.	fotoana mahafinaritra aminny ankapobeny
It seems wrong to me.	toa diso izany amiko
From there, they can do whatever they want.	afaka manao izay tiany izy ireo manomboka eo
Which it could be.	izay mety ho izy
This is the only safe method.	io fomba io ihany no azo antoka
Or he may not want to be seen.	na mety tsy te ho hita izy
And don’t have a problem with that.	ary aza manana olana aminizany
So, you have a choice.	noho izany manana safidy ianao
It's someone else.	olona hafa io
Yes, ours.	eny ny anay
I always get them.	mahazo azy ireo foana aho
He didn't like to walk.	tsy tia nandeha izy
I was meaningless.	tsy nisy dikany aho
Tonight, if you will.	anio alina raha tianao
He should have been earlier.	tokony ho teo aloha izy
The reality is not always pleasant.	tsy dia mahafinaritra foana ny zavamisy
She said she didn't need a man.	nilaza izy fa tsy mila lehilahy
These are just three.	telo fotsiny ireo
He loved it all.	tiany daholo izany
I'm still young.	mbola kely aho
Better if one dies.	tsara kokoa raha maty ny iray
The truth is, however, that he doesn’t like it.	ny marina anefa dia tsy tiany izany
This is not a fact.	tsy zavamisy izany
Where we were all.	izay nisy antsika rehetra
Life itself stopped.	ny fiainana mihitsy no nijanona
I am very happy.	faly be aho
You're crazy, man.	adala ianao lehilahy
Here, here.	eto eto
Yes, you know.	eny fantatrao
We did a lot of things as we traveled.	nanao zavatra be dia be izahay rehefa nandeha
Everything has to be the best.	ny zavadrehetra dia tsy maintsy ho ny tsara indrindra
And that is a problem for us.	ary olana ho antsika izany
He is everything to me.	izy no zavadrehetra amiko
The time has also come.	efa tonga koa ny fotoana
Either way, you have to come.	na izany na tsy izany tsy maintsy tonga ianao
Some are not so difficult.	tsy dia sarotra loatra ny sasany
The same car as before.	ilay fiara teo aloha ihany
But it suits me.	saingy mety amiko izany
I might do that.	mety hanao izany aho
It looks good.	toa tsara ilay izy
There is no safe place.	tsy misy toerana azo antoka
I can do more than that.	afaka manao mihoatra noho izany aho
He is not like that.	tsy toy izany izy
But we couldn't even look.	tsy afaka nijery akory anefa izahay
He works alone.	miasa irery izy
Lots of good stuff.	betsaka ny zavatra tsara
And there was one before.	ary nisy iray koa teo aloha
There must still be somewhere.	tsy maintsy mbola misy any ho any
The night was the best.	ny alina no tsara indrindra
He was also in one.	teo aminny iray ihany koa izy
None of the other men are here right now.	tsy misy na iray aza aminireo lehilahy hafa eto aminizao fotoana izao
We need to go.	mila mandeha isika
This is the worst.	izany no ratsy indrindra
It was just a little thought.	nieritreritra kely fotsiny izany
That they are.	izay izy ireo
Sometimes.	indraindray
This is one of my favorite ones from you.	ity dia iray aminireo tiako indrindra avy aminao
Often this is not the case.	matetika dia tsy izany
I didn’t find it great.	tsy nahita lehibe aho
But enough in terms of style.	fa ampy aminny resaka fomba
Good job on this !.	asa tsara aminity
That was enough for both of us.	ampy ho anay roa izany
They are beautiful too.	tsara tarehy koa izy ireo
Of course, no one had an idea.	mazava ho azy fa tsy nisy nanana hevitra
This is where he is.	io no toerana misy azy
Now he didn’t.	ankehitriny dia tsy nanao izany izy
Maybe we won’t.	angamba tsy hanao izany isika
I might be close.	mety ho akaiky aho
In one night.	aminny alina iray
The fact is he could no longer see her.	ny zavamisy dia tsy afaka nahita azy intsony izy
I love them all for many reasons.	tiako izy rehetra noho ny antony maro
Nothing else can happen.	tsy misy zavatra hafa mety hisy
I didn’t think about the future.	tsy nieritreritra ny ho avy aho
This is not a good idea at all.	tsy hevitra tsara mihitsy izany
You just said that.	vao avy nilaza izany ianao
I never said anything like that to him.	tsy nilaza zavatra toy izany taminy mihitsy aho
He was wrong.	diso izy
No words came.	tsy nisy teny tonga
Good and good do not come automatically.	tsy tonga ho azy ny tsara sy ny tsara
Good too.	tsara koa
This story was not made for me.	tsy natao ho ahy io tantara io
So here’s the story.	dia izao ny tantara
We are still the same.	mbola samy isika
Stories as options.	tantara ho safidy
We really do.	tena manao izany izahay
It may even seem appropriate.	mety ho toa mety mihitsy aza izany
Nothing found.	tsy misy hita
I'm glad you can come.	faly aho fa afaka tonga ianao
He didn’t like it either.	tsy tiany koa izany
He is looking at you.	mijery anao izy
Always the future.	foana ny ho avy
Then do it now.	dia ataovy izao
I hope we will.	manantena aho fa hanao izany isika
He didn't stop there either.	tsy nijanona teo koa izy
It's not good at all.	tsy tsara mihitsy ilay izy
But that is where we are.	fa izay no misy antsika
Here, there was none.	eto tsy nisy
He found the money for her.	nahita ny vola ho azy izy
Something worth a lot of money, for sure.	zavatra mendrika vola be azo antoka
There is no way.	tsy misy fomba
It's too early to tell.	mbola aloha loatra ny asa aminizany
He doesn't need a problem.	tsy mila olana izy
It's nothing.	tsy inona izany
Maybe something more.	angamba zavatra bebe kokoa
They may not be.	mety tsy ho izy ireo
Which, in fact, will be easier for everyone.	izay raha ny marina dia ho mora kokoa ho anny rehetra
This idea is true.	marina io hevitra io
Good maybe.	tsara angamba
Something never works.	misy zavatra tsy mandeha mihitsy
It was all there, for sure.	teo daholo izany azo antoka
It's all gone.	efa lasa ny rehetra
It's so easy! 	mora tokoa
In fact, better.	raha ny marina tsara kokoa
We really are.	tena izahay
I'm not too happy.	tsy faly loatra aho
Really with you.	tena miaraka aminao
No, no, no and no.	tsia tsia tsia ary tsia
It’s not just an idea.	tsy hevitra fotsiny izany
I can still see him.	mbola hitako izy
They all do the same.	samy manao izany koa izy rehetra
He knew he wasn't.	fantany fa tsy izy
I think it will happen.	heveriko fa ho tanteraka izany
Maybe he's already dead.	angamba efa maty ihany izy
As long as he is worthy, you can.	raha mbola mendrika izy dia azonao atao
It could be an idea or an action, whatever.	mety ho hevitra na asa na inona na inona
It certainly doesn’t do the wrong thing.	azo antoka fa tsy manao ny tsy marina izany
Look at everyone here now.	jereo ny olona rehetra eto ankehitriny
That’s the real kind of idea.	izay no tena karazana hevitra
I love beautiful things.	tiako ny zavatra tsara tarehy
This is a time.	fotoana iray ity
We just need to see more.	mila mahita bebe kokoa fotsiny isika
This is a good option for beginners.	ity dia safidy tsara ho anny vao manomboka
Many of them seem happy.	toa faly ny maro aminizy ireo
I want to do it for her.	te hanao izany ho azy aho
Then there was the choice of method.	dia nisy ny safidy ny fomba
Then he would always have her.	dia ho nanana azy foana izy
It is not difficult to do so.	tsy sarotra ny manao izany
He did not receive any bad news.	tsy nahazo vaovao ratsy izy
It is safe and fast.	azo antoka sy haingana izany
The fool is himself.	ny adala dia ny tenany
But he did not.	tsy nanao izany anefa izy
And it went well.	ary nandeha tsara izany
Each question is only asked once.	indray mandeha ihany ny fanontaniana tsirairay
However, it went bad anyway.	na izany aza dia nandeha ratsy ihany
Or you like the process.	na tianao ny dingana
If you do, you die.	raha manao izany ianao dia maty
I hope it works well.	manantena aho fa miasa tsara
Which seems worse, in a way.	izay toa ratsy kokoa taminny fomba iray
So, you have it.	noho izany manana izany ianao
Everything started again.	nanomboka indray ny zavadrehetra
I drew pictures of them.	nanao sary azy ireo aho
Yes, yes, that's it.	eny eny izany no izy
He’s not very familiar.	tsy dia mahazatra loatra izy
He had to do something about one.	tsy maintsy nanao zavatra momba ny iray izy
They all do the same job in the same way.	izy rehetra dia manao asa mitovy aminny fomba mitovy
He still is.	mbola izy
Everything will be empty.	ho foana ny zavadrehetra
Probably good.	mety tsara angamba
And almost always, they all get time.	ary saika matetika izy rehetra dia mahazo fotoana
It can be done again.	mbola azo atao indray
He wants you to come.	tiany ho avy ianao
It’s hard to get something like that.	sarotra ny mahazo zavatra toy izany
Didn't see you.	tsy nahita anao
I love him here now.	tiako eto izy izao
Anything else will love money.	na inona na inona hafa dia ho tia vola
Need to see what.	mila mahita inona
This is an easy task.	izany no asa mora
Same thing.	io zavatra io ihany
Make it real.	ataovy izany ho tena
It was a very difficult time.	fotoana sarotra be izany
This is easily mistaken.	mora diso izany
I am exactly the same.	mitovy tanteraka aho
He loves me too.	tia ahy koa izy
But maybe and may be better than sure.	fa angamba ary mety ho tsara kokoa noho ny azo antoka
He works on it.	miasa aminizany izy
He is a handsome man.	lehilahy tsara tarehy izy
There were two large pictures inside.	nisy sary roa lehibe tao anatiny
Great as fun.	lehibe toy ny mahafinaritra
He stopped quickly.	nijanona haingana izy
Finally they did.	farany dia nanao izany izy ireo
He did not come to me.	tsy tonga tamiko izy
You already have a problem.	efa manana olana ianao
You are in a good position here.	tsara ny toerana misy anao eto
And no, it’s not yours.	ary tsia tsy anao izany
But I saw another picture.	nahita sary hafa anefa aho
Of course not for sure.	mazava ho azy fa tsy azo antoka
And lost.	ary very
Great people, actually.	olona lehibe raha ny marina
I see it in him.	hitako ao aminy izany
And do it fast.	ary ataovy haingana izany
Hopefully that will happen.	manantena fa ho tanteraka izany
That was all I enjoyed.	izay ihany no nahafinaritra ahy
Then I said it was wrong.	dia hoy aho hoe diso izany
But there is no such thing.	saingy tsy misy toy izany
They were really fun.	tena nahafinaritra tokoa izy ireo
I don't like him very much.	tsy dia tia azy
One time.	indray mandeha
We start again.	manomboka indray isika
You do not know.	tsy fantatrao
When he works.	rehefa miasa izy
But it doesn’t matter.	saingy tsy zavadehibe izany
This is fun.	mahafinaritra izao
And of course, that won’t happen.	ary mazava ho azy fa tsy ho tanteraka izany
Lots of people.	betsaka ny olona
He was never lost.	tsy very mihitsy izy
All may be good enough.	mety ho ampy tsara ny rehetra
I hope mine is too.	manantena aho fa ny ahy koa
In fact, it is not.	raha ny marina dia tsy izy io
It’s kind of different.	karazana tsy mitovy aminy izany
The food is simple and straightforward.	tsotra sy tsotra ny sakafo
There was something else as well.	nisy zavatra hafa koa
He may do this in one of two ways.	mety hanao izany aminny iray aminireo fomba roa izy
Absolutely different.	hafa mihitsy
We certainly do.	azo antoka fa manao izany isika
He had a special job and place.	nanana asa sy toerana manokana izy
Nothing too important.	tsy misy zavadehibe loatra
He can get you in many ways.	afaka mahazo anao aminny fomba maro izy
No, it's something else entirely.	tsia zavatra hafa tanteraka izany
Both have their reasons.	samy manana ny antony
i love you for that.	tiako ianao aminizany
We are here for you through the final stages.	eto izahay ho anao hatrany aminny dingana farany
But it is always wrong.	fa diso foana izany
There were also women.	nisy vehivavy koa
Nothing could be done about it.	tsy nisy azo natao taminizany
Either one or two others.	na iray na roa hafa
It's not much, he thought.	tsy dia be izany hoy izy nieritreritra
And everyone is there.	ary eo aminizany ny rehetra
I see the fit.	hitako ny mety
I know it doesn’t work for everyone.	fantatro fa tsy mety aminny rehetra izany
But more than that, he said.	saingy mihoatra noho izany hoy izy
He’s still there, and he loves it.	mbola eo izy ary tiany izany
I have had similar problems in the past.	nanana olana toy izany koa aho taloha
Of course, this is possible.	mazava ho azy fa azo atao izany
It looks real.	toa tena izy io
Now, maybe that’s a good thing.	ankehitriny angamba zavatra tsara izany
The day began.	nanomboka ny andro
However, he still knew.	na izany aza fantany ihany
Easy for some people.	mora aminny olona sasany
It’s not that important.	tsy hoe zavadehibe loatra izany
It’s a close thing.	zavatra akaiky izany
What could be better than that ?.	inona no mety ho tsara kokoa noho izany
The house is still full of people.	mbola feno olona ny trano
It seems he is.	toa izy
This is very clear.	mazava be izany
Yes, that is not good.	eny tsy tsara izany
I don't love you anymore.	tsy tia anao intsony aho
But they quickly lost that position.	saingy very haingana izany toerana izany izy ireo
Men have always loved her.	ny lehilahy dia tia azy foana
I'm gone.	efa lasa aho
People did their thing.	nanao ny azy ny olona
I hope they never know.	manantena aho fa tsy ho fantany mihitsy
But he did a great job.	nanao asa lehibe anefa izy
This is one of the big problems.	izany no iray aminireo olana lehibe
Sometimes they don’t.	indraindray tsy manao izany izy ireo
You have more options and are often safer.	manana safidy maro kokoa ianao ary matetika azo antoka kokoa
Very true and correct.	tena marina sy marina
And it’s still not all clear.	ary mbola tsy mazava daholo izany
Which isn’t too far off by any means.	izay tsy dia lavitra loatra aminny fomba rehetra
It is also a bad place on plain ground.	toerana tsy mety ihany koa aminny tany tsotra
Someone must have seen it.	tsy maintsy nisy nahita izany
This works for some people sometimes.	izany dia miasa ho anny olona sasany indraindray
He works hard.	miasa mafy izy
There was a faster way.	nisy fomba haingana kokoa
You need more than that.	mila mihoatra noho izany ianao
So are you.	toy izany koa ianao
But the timing was wrong.	diso anefa ny fotoana
He had a new job.	nanana asa vaovao izy
You shouldn’t have told me that.	tsy tokony ho nilaza izany tamiko ianao
We need to hurry.	mila haingana izahay
Others are good.	tsara ny hafa
But you can’t have everything.	saingy tsy afaka manana ny zavadrehetra ianao
Not always a good reason.	tsy antony tsara foana
he is close.	akaiky izy
Everyone seems to love me.	toa tia ahy ny rehetra
There was no place.	tsy nisy toerana
But a very small part.	fa ampahany kely dia kely
I can go.	afaka mandeha aho
And it turns out to be true.	ary hita fa marina izany
He is my favorite.	izy no tiako indrindra
And that’s what it really is.	ary izany no tena izy
I will always know where he is.	ho fantatro foana ny misy azy
But there is a problem.	misy olana anefa
It was really fun.	tena nahafinaritra
This can be very difficult.	mety ho sarotra be izany
You can do the same.	afaka manao izany koa ianao
But that is not the end.	tsy izany anefa no farany
Then the word goes.	dia mandeha ny teny
Life is hard, but not all the time.	mafy ny fiainana fa tsy aminny fotoana rehetra
It was a normal day again.	andro mahazatra indray izany
It is possible, but it is not easy to do.	azo atao izany saingy tsy mora ny manao izany
Nothing is right.	tsy misy na inona na inona mety
I have never seen anything like them.	mbola tsy nahita toa azy ireo mihitsy aho
Of course, this is not the case.	mazava ho azy fa tsy araka ny tokony ho izy izany
Or two, if possible.	na roa raha azo atao
It should do that, he said.	tokony hanao izany hoy izy
I know that timing is the most important thing.	fantatro fa ny fotoana no tena zavadehibe
That’s all there is to it right now.	izay ihany no eto aminizao fotoana izao
Yes, it really is.	eny tena izany
We start by working with him.	manomboka aminny asa miaraka aminy isika
And he said he didn’t know why.	ary nilaza izy fa tsy fantany ny antony
So not too much.	ka tsy be loatra
They have to do it alone.	tsy maintsy manao izany irery izy ireo
But there is nothing wrong, nothing wrong.	saingy tsy misy ratsy tsy misy ratsy
That is a question.	fanontaniana io
And now it’s a war.	ary izao dia ady
Maybe not so much.	angamba tsy dia be
And they will do it again.	ary hanao izany indray izy ireo
It was a wonderful time for both of us.	fotoana nahafinaritra ho anay roa izany
His but not mine.	ny azy fa tsy ny ahy
They always do.	manao izany foana izy ireo
There are no guarantees.	tsy misy antoka
Such is the war.	toy izany ny ady
Maybe you have something similar.	angamba ianao manana zavatra mitovy
He didn’t know what it was.	tsy fantany hoe inona izany
He looked at the house.	nijery ny trano izy
It’s work.	asa izany
I would know, if they had.	ho fantatro raha nanana izy ireo
It’s nice that he came so far.	mahafinaritra fa tonga lavitra izy
not.	tsy
It should be better.	tokony ho tsara kokoa izany
I don't get it.	tsy mahazo azy aho
We will be happy.	ho faly isika
I didn't think so.	tsy nieritreritra aho
And even us.	ary na dia izahay aza
It was completely different.	hafa tanteraka ilay izy
This is a difficult time.	fotoana sarotra izao
But the other method works almost the same.	saingy ny fomba hafa dia miasa saika mitovy
You have to.	tsy maintsy ianao io
They had news, they said.	nanana vaovao izy ireo hoy izy ireo
He also got good results.	nahazo vokatra tsara koa izy
They always are.	izy ireo foana
I really hope so.	tena manantena izany aho
Very suitable for this small part.	tena mety aminity ampahany kely ity
I saw something.	nahita zavatra aho
I would love to have one.	tiako ny manana iray
Yes, right now.	eny aminizao fotoana izao
He knows them well.	fantany tsara izy ireo
All right !.	tsara daholo
This is also the least accurate.	io ihany koa no kely indrindra marina
In more ways than one.	aminny fomba maro kokoa noho ny iray
I don't want to do too much with it.	tsy te hanao be loatra aminizany aho
In the end it only came with money.	taminny farany dia tonga taminny vola ihany
If so.	raha izany no izy
Especially from a distance.	indrindra fa avy lavitra
And not a house anymore.	ary tsy trano intsony
We need more like him in this world.	mila bebe kokoa toa azy isika eto aminity tontolo ity
The same goes for food.	toy izany koa ny sakafo
The path is clear.	mazava ny lalana
I wouldn’t have thought that about him.	tsy ho nieritreritra izany momba azy aho
We were alone, no one was there.	irery izahay tsy nisy olona teo
Three of these problems.	olana telo aminireo
Just look at him.	jereo ihany izy
Now, he thought, and looked around.	ankehitriny nieritreritra izy ary nijery ny manodidina azy
Both are around.	samy eo aminny manodidina
Right is right and wrong is wrong.	ny marina no marina ary ny ratsy no diso
Ours is simple.	tsotra ny anay
But it doesn’t exist.	saingy tsy misy izany
He saw something in me.	nahita zavatra tamiko izy
This is very clear.	mazava tsara izany
That, might be a good idea.	izay mety ho hevitra tsara
Here is the general idea.	ity ny hevitra ankapobeny
Of course, he knew it wouldn't happen.	mazava ho azy fa fantany fa tsy hisy izany
I love this approach.	tiako io fomba io
He is not just a man.	tsy lehilahy iray ihany izy
So you came.	ka tonga ianao
He will definitely do it.	tena hanao izany izy
The fact is that women can too.	ny zavamisy dia ny vehivavy koa dia afaka
But it could be worse.	mety ho ratsy kokoa anefa izany
I want to be better than you.	te ho tsara kokoa noho ianao aho
Not at first.	tsy taminny voalohany
I think he likes both.	heveriko fa tiany izy roa
The two will be one.	ho iray ny roa
She is more beautiful here.	tsara tarehy kokoa izy eto
But he didn’t have it.	saingy tsy nanana izany izy
But this is no ordinary year.	tsy taona mahazatra anefa ity
And in fact, he had a real idea.	ary raha ny marina nanana hevitra tena izy
We never existed.	tsy nisy mihitsy izahay
It couldn’t be more beautiful.	tsy mbola tsara tarehy kokoa izany
I like men.	mahafinaritra ahy ny lehilahy
This is another common thing about you.	zavatra mahazatra hafa momba anao izany
There could be three of them.	mety ho telo aminizy ireo
But it is obvious.	hita anefa izany
However, the first two parts.	na izany aza ny ampahany roa voalohany
We also love cars.	tia fiara koa izahay
And it’s not so clear.	ary tsy dia mazava loatra
What now 	inona izao
She’s so beautiful when she’s crazy.	tena tsara tarehy izy rehefa adala
You can do that.	afaka manao izany ianao
That's right, they said.	marina izany hoy izy ireo
He also had many other things.	nanana zavatra maro hafa koa izy
there will be a future.	hisy ho avy
Anyway, a decent little game.	na izany na tsy izany lalao kely mendrika
Don't go there.	aza mandeha any
As usual, alone.	toy ny mahazatra irery
It could be the same for both of us.	mety ho toy izany koa izahay roa
However, everything has to start at the bottom.	na izany aza tsy maintsy manomboka aminny farany ambany ny rehetra
It might be worth it.	mety ho mendrika izany
It must come from him.	tsy maintsy avy aminy izany
This is an easy process once you know how.	ity dia dingana mora rehefa fantatrao ny fomba
I never knew about it.	tsy fantatro mihitsy ny momba izany
Whatever works, works.	na inona na inona miasa miasa
Unless it's just a game.	raha tsy hoe mbola resaka lalao ihany
Have a good job.	manana asa tsara
It’s good to see the world.	tsara ny mijery izao tontolo izao
He said that was the best idea.	nilaza izy fa izany no hevitra tsara indrindra
It wasn’t that he thought for himself.	tsy izy io fa nieritreritra ny tenany
They are the same now.	mitovy izy ireo ankehitriny
Maybe one day in the future.	angamba indray andro any aminny ho avy
But you don't know it.	tsy fantatrao anefa izany
Mine has it.	ny ahy dia manana izany
It didn’t happen to us.	tsy nisy anay izany
And here we are again.	ary eto indray isika
However, he could have done better.	na izany aza dia afaka nanao tsara kokoa izy
He seems lost.	toa very izy
He died instantly.	maty teo no ho eo izy
The story is wrong.	diso ny tantara
The same place.	ny toerana mitovy
It seems like a good life.	toa ny fiainana tsara
Maybe not tonight, but eventually.	angamba tsy anio alina fa aminny farany
But it seemed good at the time.	toa tsara anefa izany taminizany fotoana izany
This is very clear.	mazava be izao
So there it is.	noho izany dia misy izao
You got me there.	nahazo ahy tao ianao
He had a similar problem.	nanana olana mitovy aminizany koa izy
We enjoyed doing it.	nahafinaritra anay ny nanao izany
It’s just the beginning of everything.	manomboka fotsiny ny zavadrehetra
But not too good.	saingy tsy dia tsara loatra
That was the first.	izay no voalohany
Found in.	hita ao aminny
But there will be one.	fa hisy iray
People look their best.	ny olona mijery ny tsara indrindra
I have no problem with that.	tsy manana olana aminizany aho
The fact that it’s just a bad game.	ny zavamisy fa lalao ratsy fotsiny
If they only knew what was to come.	raha mba fantany izay ho avy
If that doesn’t work, we don’t work.	raha tsy mandeha izany dia tsy miasa izahay
I hope this is good news.	manantena aho fa vaovao tsara izany
Which is not it.	izay tsy izany
Maybe soon for me.	angamba tsy ho ela ho ahy
He stopped because he stopped too.	nijanona izy satria nijanona koa izy
Died when he arrived.	maty rehefa tonga
Evil must be evil.	ny ratsy dia tokony ho ratsy
And of course, that’s just not right.	ary mazava ho azy fa tena tsy mety izany
I personally like it.	tiako manokana
No problem is big or too small.	tsy misy olana lehibe na kely loatra
Thanks to them all.	misaotra azy rehetra
Now they have to do it.	ankehitriny dia tsy maintsy manao izany izy ireo
I am no longer alone.	tsy irery intsony aho
Like.	toy ny hoe
Just a story.	tantara fotsiny
It's been a long time coming.	efa ela no tonga
He alone.	izy irery ihany
You look at him when he is not looking at you.	mijery azy ianao rehefa tsy mijery anao izy
I don’t think it makes sense to me.	heveriko fa tsy misy dikany amiko izany
Full and complete.	feno sy tanteraka
They were the worst people back then.	izy ireo no olona ratsy indrindra taminizany
It’s not easy now.	tsy mora izany ankehitriny
I said there were two before.	nilaza aho fa nisy roa taloha
Just another step.	dingana hafa fotsiny
None of us had an idea.	tsy nisy nanana hevitra izahay
He didn’t do it well.	tsy nanao izany tsara izy
It finally stopped.	nijanona ihany izany taminny farany
I have land.	manana tany aho
We get it first.	mahazo azy aloha isika
There may be many other reasons as well.	mety misy antony maro hafa koa
The world goes without us.	mandeha tsy misy antsika izao tontolo izao
Smaller ones may not.	ny kely kokoa dia mety tsy
He was mad at her.	adala taminy izy
We have already done that.	efa nanao izany izahay
This is not yet a problem for us.	tsy mbola olana ho anay izany
Not everyone loves everything all the time.	tsy ny rehetra no tia ny zavadrehetra aminny fotoana rehetra
There were no guarantees.	tsy nisy antoka
Then there are two houses.	avy eo dia misy trano roa
She is beautiful.	tsara tarehy izy
You did something real.	nanao zavatra tena izy ianao
I'm looking at it.	mijery anio aho
He doesn’t seem to be with them.	toa tsy miaraka aminizy ireo izy
To me, everything is around him.	amiko dia manodidina azy daholo ny zavadrehetra
Not if you don’t like it.	tsy raha tsy tianao
No, very large.	tsia lehibe be
Otherwise, everything is the same.	raha tsy izany dia mitovy daholo ny zavadrehetra
Do this when you get both.	ataovy izany rehefa mahazo azy roa ianao
Maybe they still do.	angamba mbola manao izany izy ireo
But the task was not easy.	tsy mora anefa ny asa
Probably.	mety
Yes, he has it.	eny manana izany izy
This is also not true.	tsy izany koa no marina
He looked at the others.	nijery ny hafa izy
They all do the work.	samy manao ny asa izy rehetra
Always now.	foana izao
However, we are pretty sure.	na izany aza azo antoka tsara izahay
But he is silent.	tsy misy resaka anefa izy
They are just not there.	tsy eo fotsiny izy ireo
That is enough for them.	ampy azy ireo izany
There were not enough words.	tsy nisy teny ampy
There are others as well.	misy hafa koa
True, I can't.	marina fa tsy afaka
But he did not see it.	tsy nahita anefa izy
So, that’s not the idea.	noho izany tsy izany no hevitra
But I still love them.	mbola tia azy ireo anefa
He was so happy to look at me.	faly be izy nijery ahy
And finally he did.	ary farany dia nanao izany izy
She is happy to be free.	faly izy fa afaka
But that doesn't work.	tsy mandeha anefa izany
He knows about it.	fantany ny momba izany
But they died.	maty anefa izy ireo
They are there.	eo izy ireo
They could and they did.	afaka ary nanao izany izy ireo
Or any other activity.	na hetsika hafa
It's gone, the old world.	lasa ilay izy ilay tontolo taloha
It’s not always like this.	tsy toy izao foana
I think that's the right thing to do.	heveriko fa izay no mety
That's right.	izany tokoa
Of course, there is a very good reason for that.	mazava ho azy fa misy antony tena tsara aminizany
Then he went thinking.	dia lasa nieritreritra izy
But he seemed very happy.	toa faly be anefa izy
Some even stayed overnight.	nisy olona nijanona alina mihitsy aza
I really see that.	tena hitako izany
He didn't think well.	tsy nieritreritra tsara izy
There was a lot of talk.	be dia be ny resaka
To the ground.	ho any aminny tany
Too much.	be loatra
But maybe they shouldn’t.	saingy angamba tsy tokony ho izy ireo
I need to do something else.	mila manao zavatra hafa aho
I don't know him very well.	tsy fantatro tsara izy
We couldn't even walk.	tsy afaka nandeha akory izahay
Only money is insecure.	ny vola ihany no tsy azo antoka
That's not all right.	tsy mety daholo izany
You still do you.	mbola manao anao foana ianao
The results are fantastic.	mahafinaritra ny vokatra
We do not see the future.	tsy mahita ny ho avy isika
He is very fast.	tena haingana izy
We were happy to do so.	faly izahay nanao izany
You have to do what is right for you.	tsy maintsy manao izay mety aminao ianao
But it didn’t stop there.	saingy tsy nijanona izany
Free people are only part of the story.	ampahany ihany taminny tantara ireo olona afaka
And yes, we have to act fast.	ary eny tsy maintsy manao zavatra haingana isika
If anything, it was different.	raha nisy izany dia hafa
Work is still needed.	mbola ilaina ny asa
Beauty is like beauty.	ny tsara tarehy dia toy ny tsara tarehy
Now, don’t get me wrong here.	ankehitriny aza diso hevitra eto aho
In the end it was as simple as that.	taminny farany dia tsotra toy izany
Then he looks at me.	dia mijery ahy izy
And he has an idea.	ary manana hevitra izy
It works anyway.	dia miasa na izany na tsy izany
I wouldn’t do it otherwise.	tsy hanao izany aho raha tsy izany
Because you own it, you make money.	satria ianao no manana azy dia mahazo vola ianao
Everything else is fine.	tsara ny zavatra hafa rehetra
Some big, some small.	ny sasany lehibe ny sasany kely
I have never made a world without it.	mbola tsy nanao izao tontolo izao tsy misy azy aho
But look closely, things seem different.	fa jereo akaiky dia toa hafa ny zavatra
He just walked, and very fast.	nandeha fotsiny izy ary haingana be
Something else is to come.	misy zavatra hafa ho avy
It's not fun.	tsy mahafinaritra izany
They got money.	nahazo vola izy ireo
But she never really loved him.	tsy tena tia azy mihitsy anefa
Not like before.	tsy toy ny taloha
It’s exactly as it should be.	tena araka ny tokony ho izy izany
Nothing more than that.	tsy misy zavatra mihoatra noho izany
The money wasn’t just there.	tsy teo fotsiny ny vola
I'm glad he is.	faly aho fa izy
The man has arrived.	efa tonga ilay lehilahy
Sometimes they did it, just left.	indraindray dia nanao izany izy ireo lasa fotsiny
They had no problems.	tsy nisy olana izy roa
Now you are there.	ankehitriny ianao eo
That could be really good.	mety ho tena tsara izany
He said to himself.	dia hoy izy taminny tenany
You can't do that anymore.	tsy afaka manao izany intsony ianao
He will do it for me.	izy no hanao izany ho ahy
There is a first thing to that.	misy zavatra voalohany aminizany
No one did that.	tsy nisy nanao toy izany
We are that.	izahay dia izany
He is your man.	izy no lehilahy anao
In other words, eventually you will know.	aminny teny hafa aminny farany dia ho fantatrao
However, you often expect it not to be.	na izany aza manantena matetika ianao fa tsy ho izany
Which, of course, is not even true.	izay mazava ho azy dia tsy marina akory
For those close to me.	ho anny akaiky ahy
And that’s a good thing.	ary zavatra tsara izany
All possible options.	safidy rehetra azo atao rehetra
You are not an ordinary person.	tsy olona tsotra ianao
The man seemed happy.	toa faly ilay lehilahy
It is time to be close to him again.	fotoana iray ho akaiky azy indray izao
There is no time without process.	tsy misy ny fotoana raha tsy misy ny dingana
I really like him.	tena tia azy aho
There is no good way.	tsy misy fomba tsara
Only one of these exists.	iray aminireo ihany no misy
I have come a long way.	efa lasa lavitra aho
This game is really bad.	tena ratsy tokoa ity lalao ity
Not really sure.	tsy tena azo antoka
As in the end, the food was great.	toy ny taminny farany tsara be ny sakafo
But I'm used to it.	efa mahazatra ahy anefa izany
I know it’s like life.	fantatro fa mitovy aminny fiainana izany
The woman was even beautiful when she did.	tsara tarehy mihitsy aza ilay vehivavy rehefa nanao izany
Yes, there is.	eny misy
I just had a wonderful trip.	vao avy nanao dia mahafinaritra aho
Sometimes it all gets better.	indraindray izy rehetra dia mahazo tsara
So that’s all good.	noho izany dia tsara daholo izany
That’s all, of course.	rehetra izany mazava ho azy
That's a bad idea.	hevitra ratsy izany
Much, much worse than before.	be ratsy lavitra noho ny teo aloha
It seems to be very real.	toa tena misy tokoa izany
It is necessary.	ilaina izany
Good for you.	tsara ho anao
But they do a lot for many other people.	manao zavatra betsaka ho anny olona maro hafa anefa izy ireo
In the end, it seemed like nothing happened.	taminny farany dia toy ny tsy nisy izany
It's different.	hafa izao
I know that not everyone agrees with me.	fantatro fa tsy ny rehetra no mitovy hevitra amiko
As you already know, this is not true.	araka ny efa fantatrao dia tsy marina izany
But that’s just the beginning of the conversation.	fa izay vao manomboka ny resaka
I want to do it for myself.	te hanao izany ho ahy manokana aho
He didn’t want to lose a single one.	tsy tiany ho very na dia iray aza
And they need action.	ary mila hetsika izy ireo
No, not you, though.	tsia tsy ianao na dia
It could be money in the end.	mety ho lasa vola ihany izany taminny farany
Impossible work, of course.	asa tsy azo atao mazava ho azy
And there are no good pictures of him.	ary tsy misy sary tsara momba azy akory
Often, though.	matetika anefa izany
It was very different then.	hafa be ilay izy taminizany
I don't like him.	tsy tia azy aho
To me, it’s something completely different.	amiko dia zavatra hafa tanteraka izany
You needed me.	nila ahy ianao
Some are small and ordinary.	ny sasany dia kely sy mahazatra
He saw something else.	nahita zavatra hafa koa izy
We must follow them.	tsy maintsy manaraka azy ireo isika
Things are not going well.	tsy mandeha tsara ny zavatra
There is no more time.	tsy misy intsony ny fotoana
And because you are beautiful.	ary satria tsara tarehy ianao
From.	avy aminny
And beautiful.	ary tsara tarehy
I never saw him.	tsy nahita azy mihitsy
We arrived immediately.	tonga avy hatrany izahay
Which was good for me.	izay tsara tamiko
You do the same.	manao toy izany koa ianao
Just the old story.	ny tantara taloha ihany
It just doesn’t seem fun.	toa tsy mahafinaritra fotsiny izany
But he didn't like me.	tsy tiany anefa aho
Kind of a common thing.	karazana zavatra mahazatra
Do him wrong now.	ataovy ratsy izao izy
You alone did it.	ianao ihany no nanao izany
They will lose their jobs.	ho very asa izy ireo
And right now.	ary aminizao fotoana izao
This is the first such issue.	ity no olana voalohany toy izany
But this is not always a good thing.	tsy zavatra tsara foana anefa izany
It won't make sense to him.	tsy hisy dikany aminy izany
Here we are now.	eto isika izao
This is important for two reasons.	zavadehibe izany noho ny antony roa
Now then.	ankehitriny ary
Now, that will be the end result.	ankehitriny izany no ho vokatra farany
Or, something like that.	na zavatra toy izany
He looked at her, not seeing.	nijery azy izy tsy nahita
He must be close.	tsy maintsy akaiky izy
That is exactly the problem.	izany indrindra no olana
Reason for that.	antony aminizany
In fact, it’s more.	raha ny marina dia bebe kokoa izany
Time flies.	mandeha haingana ny fotoana
That would be a good thing.	mety ho zavatra tsara izany
Whether they got what they wanted or not.	na dia nahazo izay tiany izy ireo na tsia
He is himself.	izy no tenany
No one seemed to be there.	toa tsy nisy olona teo
This is a matter of history.	resaka tantara izao
But there was another similar story.	saingy nisy tantara hafa toy izany
Almost a man.	saika lehilahy
See you there !.	ho hita eo
Different is very difficult.	samy hafa sarotra be
Or he can see the future.	na afaka mahita ny ho avy izy
Some games are better than others.	ny lalao sasany mihoatra noho ny hafa
He is good.	izy no tsara
Far from here.	lavitra eto
This is good for us.	tsara ho antsika izany
But he certainly isn’t the last.	saingy azo antoka fa tsy izy no farany
So all is well.	ka tsara daholo
I see that no one has.	hitako fa tsy misy manana
This is not entirely possible.	tsy azo atao tanteraka izany
Yes, it is.	eny tokoa izany
And good too.	ary tsara ihany koa
We must do what is necessary first.	tsy maintsy manao zavatra ilaina aloha isika
But he was happy.	faly anefa izy
And he can.	ary mety izy
Do it now.	ataovy izao ary
You get it.	mahazo izany ianao
The person is gone.	efa lasa ilay olona
You did it to me, he said.	ianao no nanao izany tamiko hoy izy
He always thought well.	nieritreritra tsara foana izy
Maybe he had had enough.	efa ampy azy angamba izy
But not unless you’re there.	saingy tsy raha tsy eo ianao
Then they came.	dia tonga izy ireo
Even now, she’s almost pretty.	na dia izao aza dia efa saika tsara tarehy izy
Yes, they did.	eny nanao izany izy ireo
That's good there.	tsara izany eo
I have to watch him.	tsy maintsy mijery azy aho
To other men.	aminny lehilahy hafa
He looked at the woman.	nijery ilay vehivavy izy
But you also need someone else.	mila olona hafa koa anefa ianao
It’s almost too easy.	saika mora loatra izany
Once they started, they didn’t stop.	raha vao nanomboka izy ireo dia tsy nijanona
It's been two days.	roa andro izao
But it can be good.	mety tsara anefa izany
But we did nothing.	tsy nanao na inona na inona anefa izahay
But so do you.	saingy toa ianao koa
It’s not easy, it’s for sure.	tsy mora izany azo antoka izany
Nothing is the same.	tsy misy zavatra mitovy
It started in the usual way.	nanomboka taminny fomba mahazatra
There is a possibility.	misy mety
Maybe something you can do.	angamba zavatra iray azonao natao
He got worse.	lasa ratsy kokoa izy
Another option is my own.	safidy iray hafa dia ny ahy manokana
The conversation is the same.	toy izany koa ny resaka
I don't think so.	toa tsy mety aho
You can do it any way you like.	azonao atao izany na aminny fomba tianao
I think they deserve more.	heveriko fa mendrika kokoa izy ireo
Another great news.	vaovao lehibe iray hafa
There is nothing you can do now.	tsy misy azonao atao izao
If you don’t like it, that’s fine.	raha tsy tianao izany dia tsara izany
This is no small task.	tsy asa kely izany
I don’t want that for you.	tsy tiako ho anao izany
The future is hard work.	ny ho avy dia ny asa mafy
What goes on here.	inona no lasa eto
Anything more than that is wrong.	na inona na inona mihoatra noho izany dia tsy mety
They work harder, in general.	miasa mafy kokoa izy ireo aminny ankapobeny
But he loved it.	tiany anefa izany
He could have done more if he wanted to.	afaka nanao bebe kokoa izy raha tiany
But they are not the same.	tsy mitovy anefa izy ireo
Everyone can do it.	afaka manao izany ny rehetra
It's a war.	ady izany
Yes, we did.	eny natao izahay
Something about it.	zavatra aminizany
This is a very common thing.	tena zavatra mahazatra izany
Some things are absolutely necessary.	ilaina tanteraka ny zavatra sasany
There was nothing there at all.	tsy nisy na inona na inona tao mihitsy
It was just not a conversation.	tsy nisy resaka fotsiny izany
It’s totally wrong to do that.	tena tsy mety ny manao anio
It’s very likely.	tena mety ho izy
And don’t enjoy it.	ary aza mahafinaritra anao izany
This year is better.	tsara kokoa ity taona ity
Two years ago.	roa taona lasa izao
You have a lot to fight for.	manana be dia be aminny ady ianao
Which is fun.	izay mahafinaritra
This may be the first time.	mety ho voalohany izany
That’s a lot of money.	vola be izany
Of course, it’s all gone.	mazava ho azy fa lasa daholo izany
The truth, however, is completely different.	ny marina anefa dia hafa tanteraka
And that’s a good question.	ary fanontaniana tsara izany
That we can still be together.	ny hoe mbola afaka miaraka isika
It’s the same with him.	mitovy aminny azy ihany koa
We are glad to have you.	faly izahay manana anao
It already exists for some of them.	efa misy izany ho anny sasany aminizy ireo
The work here is completely different.	hafa tanteraka ny asa eto
But that is very difficult for me.	tena sarotra amiko anefa izany
There is a lot of time.	misy fotoana be
There is always a bad type.	misy karazana ratsy foana
However, I still like it.	na izany aza mbola tiako izany
They all seemed happy.	toa faly izy rehetra
It’s a little harder than that.	somary sarotra noho izany ilay izy
A bigger reason than that.	antony lehibe noho izy
But very fast.	fa tena haingana
That’s one of the good things.	izany no iray aminireo zavatra tsara
Nothing was found there.	tsy nisy na inona na inona hita tany
That is the sure way.	izany no lalana azo antoka
But it never came to me.	saingy tsy tonga tamiko mihitsy izany
It really did exist.	tena nisy ihany
So that’s a problem.	ka olana iray izany
A lot of places don’t.	betsaka ny toerana tsy manao izany
Yes, they are wrong too.	eny diso koa izy ireo
For reasons other than yours.	noho ny antony hafa noho ny anao
They will be happy.	ho faly izy ireo
You are very talkative, 'he said.	be resaka ianao hoy izy
Maybe a little.	mety kely
These will be in the first.	ireo dia ho ao aminny voalohany
They are good women.	vehivavy tsara izy ireo
We seem to have lost our way.	toa very lalana izahay
And these things are small.	ary kely ireo zavatra ireo
And it’s not good for all of us.	ary tsy tsara ho antsika rehetra izany
I think he is here.	heveriko fa eto izy
So there may be more land.	noho izany dia mety hisy tany bebe kokoa
He looked at me.	nijery ahy
It’s not that he just loves her.	tsy hoe tia azy fotsiny izy
Better than everyone else right now.	tsara kokoa noho ny hafa rehetra aminizao fotoana izao
In general, it makes no sense.	aminny ankapobeny dia tsy misy dikany izany
The situation is the same.	mitovy ihany ny zavamisy
I was always there for you.	teo foana aho ho anao
They are, well.	izy ireo tsara
This place is tough.	mafy io toerana io
I have no idea about that at all.	tsy manana hevitra momba izany mihitsy aho
They will do something about it.	hanao zavatra momba izany izy ireo
The same is true of people.	toy izany koa ny olona
The big ones do, sometimes.	ny lehibe dia manao indraindray
Even a small thing.	na zavatra kely aza
Maybe he really loves me.	angamba tena tia ahy izy
The house and location are good.	tsara ny trano sy ny toerana misy azy
Loves to do things.	tia manao zavatra
War is life.	ny ady dia fiainana
It’s no easier than that.	tsy mora kokoa noho izany izany
That’s just one of the reasons.	izany ihany no iray aminireo antony
He is not right even if he is right.	tsy marina izy na marina aza
There was nothing, nothing for people.	tsy nisy na inona na inona na inona na inona ho anny olona
I know it will do the same for you.	fantatro fa hanao toy izany koa aminao izany
And it can be a bad thing to get completely.	ary mety ho zavatra tsy mety ny mahazo tanteraka
I see them now.	hitako izy ireo izao
They were fun.	nahafinaritra izy ireo
Same with you, really.	mitovy aminao tena
And it really means something to me.	ary tena misy dikany amiko izany
They are from there.	avy any izy ireo
I did nothing wrong.	tsy nanao ratsy aho
You have to do it.	tsy maintsy manao izany ianao
Or make your own.	na manao ny anao manokana
He just stared.	nijery fotsiny izy
Some go farther than others.	ny sasany lasa lavitra kokoa noho ny hafa
It's hard there.	mafy ny any
Time is money, and a lot too.	ny fotoana dia vola ary betsaka ihany koa
Apparently so.	toa izany no izy
He will come for us.	ho avy ho antsika izy
The dead are dead.	ny maty dia maty
Yes and that’s perfectly good.	eny ary tsara tanteraka izany
They got nothing.	tsy nahazo na inona na inona izy ireo
Not enough.	tsy ampy
This is common.	efa mahazatra izany
That’s right, of course.	marina izany mazava ho azy

The time has come that is enough.	tonga ny fotoana izay efa ampy
Some are easier than others.	ny sasany dia mora kokoa noho ny hafa

Mine was years ago.	ny ahy dia taona lasa

I love having a good time.	tiako ny fotoana mahafinaritra
He didn't look at himself.	tsy nijery ny tenany izy
It's so nice to see you.	tena mahafinaritra ny mahita anao
Especially in the last two years.	indrindra fa taminny roa taona farany
Yes, good work on that.	eny asa tsara aminizany
Not for him at all.	tsy ho azy mihitsy

People are starting to move to other places.	manomboka mandeha any aminny toerana hafa ny olona
There are no questions about it.	tsy misy fanontaniana ao

I think you already know that.	heveriko fa efa fantatrao izany
He did not say that immediately.	tsy nilaza izany avy hatrany izy

Really fun and exciting.	tena mahafinaritra sy mahafinaritra
In fact, they already exist.	raha ny marina dia efa misy izy ireo
Sometimes it takes years to know.	indraindray mila taona maro vao fantatrao
So, that’s good.	noho izany tsara izany

The truth is there is a faster way.	ny marina dia misy fomba haingana kokoa
Just fun.	mahafinaritra fotsiny
This kind of clarity is important.	zavadehibe io karazana mazava io
Of course, they are not all the same.	azo antoka fa tsy mitovy izy rehetra

Really great job.	asa lehibe tokoa
No, this is the food.	tsia io no sakafo
This should be the big one.	io no tokony ho ilay lehibe
It’s different, for sure.	hafa izany azo antoka
I’m not a fast -moving guy.	tsy lehilahy tia mandeha haingana aho
And sometimes it works.	ary indraindray dia miasa izany
Although not for everyone.	na dia tsy ho anny rehetra aza
But it was there, at the time.	saingy nisy izany taminizany fotoana izany

This one is now my favorite right away.	ity iray ity izao no tena tiako avy hatrany
There are two ways.	misy fomba roa
But something was missing.	nisy zavatra tsy ampy anefa izy
They are still good, but not very good.	mbola tsara izy ireo saingy tsy dia tsara loatra
It doesn’t make much sense at all.	tsy dia misy dikany loatra aminizany mihitsy
He didn't do anything wrong, he was just stupid.	tsy nanao ratsy izy fa adala fotsiny
But no, it’s not perfect.	saingy tsy izany tsy tanteraka
The end has come.	tonga ny farany
There are no money options available.	tsy misy safidy vola azo
Lost again.	very indray

We can't see that.	tsy afaka mahita izany isika
These cannot be the same two as before.	tsy mety ho ny roa mitovy teo aloha ireo
However, this has been the case in the past.	na izany aza dia efa nisy izany taloha

That is more true now than it was then.	marina kokoa izany ankehitriny noho ny taminizany
Game him.	lalao azy
He is not the old man.	tsy ilay lehilahy taloha izy

But get this.	fa mahazo ity
A lot of people work there.	betsaka ny olona miasa ao
No one could do that, he said.	tsy nisy afaka nanao izany hoy izy
It’s easier to work from the inside out.	mora kokoa ny miasa avy ao anatiny
But action is only one way.	fa ny hetsika dia fomba iray ihany
The news goes fast.	mandeha haingana ny vaovao
No one looked at them.	tsy nisy nijery azy ireo
Easier than that.	tsotra kokoa noho izany
Make sure you are good.	ataovy azo antoka fa tsara ianao
The environment is different to say the least.	ny tontolo manodidina dia samy hafa raha ny kely indrindra
A lot of people died.	be dia be ny olona maty
But not everyone will do it.	saingy tsy ny rehetra no hanao izany
These are big questions.	fanontaniana lehibe ireo
It's not going well.	tsy mandeha tsara izany
I’m a special kind of man.	karazana lehilahy manokana aho
This seems to be a common problem.	toa olana mahazatra izany
But he had a reason.	nanana ny antony anefa izy
It will come from within.	ho avy ao anatiny izany
They may not even need words.	mety tsy mila teny akory izy ireo
We have the house for us.	izahay dia manana ny trano ho anay
I am busy.	be asa aho
But he knew that was not the case.	fantany anefa fa tsy izany no izy
These results are important.	zavadehibe ireo vokatra ireo

This is not good.	tsy tsara izany
It's very different.	hafa mihitsy izany
Or maybe it’s not wrong.	na angamba tsy diso izany
There are other problems.	misy ny olana hafa
I have a lot of ideas.	manana hevitra be dia be
But it doesn’t go well.	saingy tsy mandeha tsara izy io
Very little was known.	kely dia kely no fantany
That is low, very low.	izany dia ambany tena ambany
Then we look at it.	dia mijery izany izahay
He was so good he couldn’t do it.	tsara loatra izy ka tsy afaka nanao izany
But he couldn't say no either.	saingy tsy afaka nilaza hoe tsia koa izy
It seemed pointless.	toy ny tsy nisy dikany izany
You may have made a better choice.	mety ho nanao safidy tsara kokoa ianao
There was something important about it.	nisy zavadehibe taminizany
And the game is near.	ary akaiky ny lalao
One would be good.	ny iray dia ho tsara
Maybe it made sense.	angamba nisy dikany izany
He does it himself.	manao izany ny tenany
It’s not guaranteed.	tsy misy antoka izany
That's good again.	tsara indray izany
Because, in fact, she is beautiful.	satria raha ny marina dia tsara tarehy izy
They all made beautiful pictures.	izy rehetra dia nanao sary tsara tarehy
I have never had this problem before.	mbola tsy nanana anio olana io aho taloha
There are still some.	mbola misy koa
People can see where you are.	afaka mahita ny toerana misy anao ny olona
But you made the wrong choice.	diso safidy anefa ianao
But it’s really simple and hard.	fa marina tsotra sy sarotra
The wrong question.	ny fanontaniana diso
Do the same.	manao izany koa
Of course, the conversation was meant for me.	mazava ho azy fa natao ho ahy ilay resaka
He did the same.	nanao toy ny iray koa izy
However, this year.	na izany aza aminity taona ity
The pictures are very similar.	ny sary dia tena mitovy
There is no guarantee of this.	tsy misy azo antoka izany
We are for him.	ho azy isika
They must see us as selfish.	tsy maintsy mahita antsika tia tena izy ireo
She is so beautiful right now.	tena tsara tarehy izy aminizao fotoana izao
But they are not very big.	saingy tsy dia lehibe loatra izy ireo
No one looks best.	tsy misy olona mijery tsara indrindra
You are the man.	ianao ilay lehilahy
But you are right.	fa marina ianao
Well, as usual.	tsara toy ny mahazatra
He probably knows everything.	fantany angamba ny zavadrehetra
Then we looked at it.	dia nijery izany izahay
It was very simple.	tsotra tokoa ilay izy
They have to be somewhere.	tsy maintsy ho any aminny toerana iray izy ireo
He may not be there.	mety tsy ao izy
So they will come up with all these ideas.	noho izany dia ho tonga aminireo hevitra rehetra ireo izy ireo
Yes, it should.	eny tokony
So, we did it.	noho izany nanao izany izahay
That may be too obvious.	mety ho mazava loatra izany
It can't come.	tsy mety ho avy izany
You always had to start somewhere.	tsy maintsy nanomboka tany ho any foana ianao
The environment has also become very pleasant.	lasa mahafinaritra be koa ny tontolo manodidina
Something is wrong, absolutely wrong.	misy zavatra tsy mety tsy mety mihitsy
They have too many options.	manana safidy maro loatra izy ireo
We got the wrong person.	nahazo olona diso izahay
They probably are.	izy ireo angamba
Maybe that’s one of the reasons.	angamba izany no iray aminireo antony
Although there is, it may not be the best option for you.	na dia misy aza dia mety tsy ho safidy tsara indrindra ho anao izany
They are with the great war.	izy ireo dia miaraka aminny ady lehibe
It is not meant to be one.	tsy natao ho iray izany
It could be the same.	mety ho toy izany koa
I love them too.	tiako koa izy ireo
This one was really fun.	tena nahafinaritra tokoa ity iray ity
Here you come to it.	eto ianao no tonga aminizany
There will be nothing to come of it.	tsy hisy na inona na inona ho avy aminizany
You are not often wrong.	tsy diso matetika ianao
Not a bad day.	tsy andro ratsy
This is very important.	tena ilaina tokoa izany
You did a good job.	nanao asa tsara ianao
You get it now.	efa azonao izao
About everything, really.	momba ny zavadrehetra tena
It’s not that he’s talkative.	tsy hoe be resaka izy
Just one day really.	indray andro ihany tokoa
This is a fact.	tena zavamisy izany
You will never be like that again.	tsy ho toy izany intsony ianao
Both are good.	samy tsara ihany izy roa
For many reasons.	noho ny antony maro
I just love the story.	tiako fotsiny ny tantara
Yes, others too.	eny hafa ihany koa
He knows what is right for him.	fantany izay mety aminy
Nothing could be done.	tsy nisy azo natao
It’s a bit too much about himself.	somary loatra ny momba ny tenany
I will do it.	hanao izany aho
It all starts here.	manomboka eto izany rehetra izany
This was sometimes true in the past.	marina izany indraindray taloha
But for me and not for you.	fa ho ahy fa tsy ho anao
Now, now it’s possible.	aminizao fotoana izao aminizao fotoana izao dia azo atao izany
The path in time.	ny lalana aminny fotoana
Or none of them.	na tsy misy aminizy ireo
But he knew it.	fantany anefa izany
He is new.	vaovao izy
Not very easy.	tsy tena mora
I knew it was you.	fantatro fa ianao ilay izy
The two are exactly the same.	mitovy tanteraka izy roa
What was there, then.	inona no nisy dia
All three are fun.	mahafinaritra ny telo
But no one has ever seen it.	tsy mbola nisy nahita izany anefa
So, the world.	noho izany izao tontolo izao
There was just something really good.	nisy zavatra tena tsara ihany
And that’s really good.	ary tena tsara izany
I'm not small.	tsy dia kely aho
However, it can go a long way.	na izany aza dia afaka mandeha lavitra
It starts with a world of nothing.	manomboka aminny tontolo tsy misy na inona na inona
I would love for you to come.	tiako raha tonga ianao
He is very real about money.	tena zavamisy momba ny vola izy
And that’s true, of course.	ary marina izany mazava ho azy
You want to be alone.	te irery ianao
Yes, we did too.	eny nanao izany koa izahay
Women do the same.	ny vehivavy dia manao toy izany koa
There are a lot of things like that.	be dia be ny zavatra toy izany
This house was made for us.	ity trano ity dia natao ho anay
We must do what is right.	tsy maintsy manao ny tsara isika
Both together.	samy miaraka
He looks very happy.	hita ho faly be izy
In general, everything is going well.	aminny ankapobeny dia mandeha tsara ny zavadrehetra
This becomes special.	ity dia lasa manokana
No, you really do.	tsia tena manao izany ianao
They really did.	tena nanao izany izy ireo
I think they are happy.	heveriko fa faly izy ireo
But it works well.	miasa tsara anefa
Not there now.	tsy any izao
But it takes time, money, and hard work.	mila fotoana sy vola ary asa mafy anefa izany
With that said, it may not be for everyone.	miaraka aminizany mety tsy ho anny rehetra izany
I really enjoyed that moment.	tena tiako izany fotoana izany
Maybe it was his.	azy angamba ilay izy
The timing is not as it seems.	ny fotoana dia tsy araka ny hita
No one does it just about women.	tsy misy manao ny momba ny vehivavy fotsiny
We didn't see anything.	tsy nahita na inona na inona izahay
I think he might have done it.	heveriko fa mety ho nanao izany izy
We always had fun.	nahafinaritra foana izahay
He really does.	tena manao izany izy
I’m not in general.	tsy aminny ankapobeny aho
And neither are we.	ary tsy isika koa
I don’t see problems in any other way.	tsy mahita olana aminny fomba hafa
There is no maximum here.	tsy misy ambony indrindra eto
This may be for other reasons as well.	mety ho noho ny antony hafa koa izany
Do all you can for her.	ataovy izay rehetra azonao atao ho azy
He said it in every way.	hoy izy taminny fomba rehetra
Two questions for you.	fanontaniana roa ho anao
It works for me, there always is.	miasa amiko izy io misy foana
I don't see any other way.	tsy hitako izay fomba hafa
It's new.	vaovao io
You know that's the way it should be.	fantatrao fa izany no tokony ho izy
Good for two men.	tsara ho anny lehilahy roa
And then he died.	ary avy eo dia maty izy
I have never seen him do that.	mbola tsy nahita azy nanao izany mihitsy aho
The timing is clearer.	mazava kokoa ny fotoana
Of course we went.	mazava ho azy fa nandeha izahay
This is the best option.	ity no safidy tsara indrindra
But it’s really fun.	tena mahafinaritra anefa izany
I think all of this is important.	heveriko fa zavadehibe ireo rehetra ireo
Just have the right thing to do.	manana ny tsara atao fotsiny
However, it is not necessary.	na izany aza tsy mila izany
It seemed like a wonderful day.	toy ny andro nahafinaritra ilay izy
He never thought personally.	tsy nieritreritra manokana mihitsy izy
There are a lot of stupid people.	be dia be ny olona adala
It will not be an option.	tsy ho safidy izany
That is a good question.	tena fanontaniana tsara ilay izy
Some were not.	tsy nisy ny sasany
It’s an event.	hetsika izany
He is not completely alone.	tsy irery tanteraka izy
See where we are tonight.	jereo izay misy antsika anio alina
Even if it is small or insignificant.	na kely na tsy misy dikany aza izany
And he wants to be happy.	ary te ho faly izy
Often, but not always.	matetika fa tsy foana
That’s good, so thank you for that.	tsara izany ka misaotra aminizany
In one of them.	aminny iray aminizy ireo
It will not.	tsy hanao izany
There is no one like us.	tsy misy toa antsika
It can be difficult.	mety ho sarotra izany
I follow the news.	manaraka ny vaovao aho
There may be others as well.	mbola misy hafa koa angamba
He may have done something for her.	mety ho nanao zavatra ho azy izy
There are two questions.	misy fanontaniana roa
Do it or not.	ataovy izany na tsia
Then he looked around.	avy eo izy dia nijery ny manodidina azy
None of us were happy about that.	tsy nisy faly taminizany izahay
We watched carefully.	nijery tsara izahay
That is what could be the cause.	izany no atao hoe mety ho antony
Either way, the idea is the same.	na izany na tsy izany dia mitovy ny hevitra
They need someone like you.	mila olona toa anao izy ireo
He could have done it alone.	afaka nanao izany irery izy
I have seen some of these things.	efa hitako ny sasany aminireo zavatra ireo
All ideas are mine alone.	ny hevitra rehetra dia ahy irery
Because she is beautiful.	satria tsara tarehy izy
I want to be good.	te ho tsara aho
And it goes two ways.	ary mandeha aminny lalana roa izany
It doesn’t become a problem.	tsy lasa olana izany
I have an idea.	manana hevitra aho
And this thing.	ary zavatra ity
Yours is that you did the right thing.	ny anao dia hoe nanao ny tsara ianao
Then they both agree.	dia mitovy hevitra izy roa
We follow him.	manaraka azy izahay
I don’t think that’s difficult.	heveriko fa tsy sarotra izany
But he did not die.	tsy maty anefa izy
They all got it.	samy nahazo izany izy rehetra
A man is free.	afaka ny lehilahy iray
Do it when the time comes.	ataovy izany rehefa tonga ny fotoana
They said.	hoy izy ireo
They always do.	manao foana izy ireo
That’s a good thing.	izany no zavatra tsara
Not women.	tsy ny vehivavy
No stupid questions.	tsy misy fanontaniana adala
The question is important.	zavadehibe ny fanontaniana
In some ways, however.	aminny fomba sasany na izany aza
Not many, but enough.	tsy maro fa ampy
I couldn't do anything.	tsy afaka nanao na inona na inona aho
One for us all.	iray ho antsika ny rehetra
Anything can be done about it.	na inona na inona azo atao aminizany
I have nothing.	tsy manana na inona na inona aho
I don't see what's wrong.	tsy hitako izay tsy mety
But he did not die, as in the previous picture.	tsy maty anefa izy toy ny taminny sary teo aloha
Yes, it does not work.	eny tsy mandeha izany
But maybe you do something else.	fa angamba manao zavatra hafa ianao
He cannot be alone.	tsy afaka ny ho irery izy
He knows, too.	fantany koa
And there is something else.	ary misy zavatra hafa
They are always easy.	mora foana izy ireo
This is a more general problem.	olana ankapobeny kokoa izany
Overall it was a fun time.	aminny ankapobeny dia fotoana nahafinaritra izany
And men are women.	ary ny lehilahy dia vehivavy
Look now, it's still going.	jereo izao mbola mandeha ihany
This place is a great time.	fotoana lehibe ity toerana ity
Without it, they die.	raha tsy misy izany dia maty izy ireo
In fact, it is very good.	raha ny tena izy dia tena tsara izany
There are a lot of problems.	be dia be ny olana
I did a little of everything.	nanao kely ny rehetra aho
That’s where it started.	teo no nanomboka
All of this is real work.	izany rehetra izany dia tena asa
It is far from difficult.	dia lavitra sarotra izany
But what is it.	fa inona ilay izy
But he is gone.	fa lasa izy
You don’t have to do too much about it.	tsy mila manao zavatra be loatra momba izany ianao
It’s a job as usual, it seems.	asa toy ny mahazatra izany toa
There is something for everyone.	misy zavatra ho anny rehetra ao
Then they stopped completely.	dia nijanona tanteraka izy ireo
The day is also different.	hafa ihany koa ny andro
Because it’s not a problem.	satria tsy olana izany
But he had to be honest.	tsy maintsy nanao ny marina anefa izy
That is.	izany no
Designed for everyone who can come.	natao ho anny rehetra izay afaka tonga
It's too late.	ela ny ela
You have to have a path with you.	tsy maintsy manana lalana miaraka aminao ianao
So he should just do it.	noho izany dia tokony hanao izany fotsiny izy
Of course, you might like other types.	mazava ho azy fa mety tianao ny karazana hafa
And many others.	ary olona maro hafa
I love everything about the place.	tiako daholo ny momba ilay toerana
Or it could be something else.	na mety ho zavatra hafa mihitsy
In fact, it is very common.	raha ny marina dia tena mahazatra
I looked at him closer.	nijery azy akaiky kokoa aho
But the dead.	fa ny maty
I think there were others.	heveriko fa mbola nisy hafa
one thing I know.	zavatra iray no fantatro
I'm bad.	ratsy aho
That's all he knows.	izay ihany no fantany
Finally there were three.	farany dia nisy telo
But, it’s a completely different matter.	saingy resaka hafa tanteraka izany
They are the only ones who should do it.	izy ireo ihany no tokony hanao izany
It will be well worth it.	tena ho mendrika izany
In general, this is an easier process.	aminny ankapobeny dingana mora kokoa izany

You have to go right away.	tsy maintsy mandeha avy hatrany ianao
He loves them without question.	tia azy ireo tsy misy fanontaniana izy

Please do so.	mba ataovy izany
Which is not the case either, of course.	izay tsy izao koa mazava ho azy
We have no war with you.	tsy manana ady aminao izahay
It was as if he loved her.	toy ny hoe tia azy izy
A lot of people said they would.	maro be no nilaza fa hanao izany izy ireo
He likes to make himself a person with great ideas.	tiany ny manao ny tenany ho olona manana hevitra lehibe

He has to go.	tsy maintsy mandeha izy
To me, it doesn’t seem to make sense on earth.	amiko dia toa tsy misy dikany aminny tany izany

But people don't do that.	tsy manao izany anefa ny olona
Too many other things.	be loatra ny zavatra hafa

It could be worse.	mety ho ratsy kokoa

Of course, we are not alone.	mazava ho azy fa tsy irery isika
Always busy, you know.	be atao foana fantatrao
It also doesn’t make sense.	tsy misy dikany koa izany
Real or not real.	tena misy na tsy tena izy
I haven’t done that before.	tsy nanao izany aho taloha
That is, the facts.	izany hoe ny zavamisy
They are decent people.	olona mendrika izy ireo
The two methods are very different.	samy hafa be ireo fomba roa ireo
Everything else is very complicated.	ny zavatra hafa rehetra dia sarotra be
Some things have to be done separately.	ny zavatra sasany dia tsy maintsy atao manokana
And it just doesn’t work.	ary tsy mandeha tsotra izao
Then you get the result.	dia mahazo ny vokatra avy eo
First, it’s not really true.	voalohany tsy tena marina izany
But not the other way around.	fa tsy ny zavatra hafa
It is no longer necessary or meaningless.	tsy ilaina na tsy misy dikany intsony izy
Nothing could be done for him.	tsy nisy azo natao ho azy
But that’s good enough.	saingy ampy tsara izany
Some are easy.	ny sasany dia mora
Yes or no.	eny na tsia izany
But time is dead.	fa ny fotoana dia maty
I see you.	hitako ianao
Both are very simple.	izy roa dia tena tsotra
The story is unusual.	tsy mahazatra ny tantara
However, therefore.	na izany aza noho izany
We didn’t do that.	tsy nanao izany izahay
Yes, almost everyone.	eny saika ny rehetra
He looked around.	nijery manodidina izy
Then he was alone.	dia izy irery
Today, tonight.	andro izao alina izao
It's not very good.	tsy dia tsara ilay izy
It was a great choice for us.	safidy lehibe ho antsika izany
This is where we should be.	eto no tokony hisy antsika
Nothing like that before now.	tsy misy toy izany aloha ankehitriny
They really need better.	tena mila tsara kokoa izy ireo
This is not wrong.	tsy diso izany
But maybe that’s a good thing.	fa angamba zavatra tsara izany
This is the best find.	izany no nahita tsara indrindra
I don’t think it’s going to be very pretty.	tsy heveriko fa ho tsara tarehy be ilay izy
He is not the worst.	tsy izy no ratsy indrindra
A picture is a picture.	ny sary dia sary
I hope he comes soon.	manantena aho fa ho tonga haingana izy
I'm so glad to see you.	tena faly aho mahita anao
We are not the problem.	tsy isika no olana
We cannot be lost.	tsy afaka ny ho very isika
I think it's good.	heveriko fa tsara ilay izy
He now knows the truth.	fantany ny marina izao
There was nothing, of course.	tsy nisy na inona na inona mazava ho azy
Then they died.	dia maty izy ireo
I hope everything will be different.	manantena aho fa ho hafa ny zavadrehetra
Money can become a new home there.	mety ho lasa trano vaovao any ny vola
We already see problems.	efa mahita olana isika
It used to be.	izy ilay izy taloha
And that’s very important.	ary tena zavadehibe izany
We all watch it.	isika rehetra dia mijery izany
For him, time just stood still.	ho azy nijanona fotsiny ny fotoana
Yes, it is hard work.	eny asa mafy izany
I looked at him closely.	nijery azy akaiky aho
That's great.	tsara be izany
In a special way.	aminny fomba manokana
You are always there.	eo foana ianao
No one has ever seen me do that.	tsy mbola nisy nahita ahy nanao izany
So we have that product.	noho izany dia manana izany vokatra izany isika
Sometimes you have to be real.	indraindray ianao dia tokony ho tena zavamisy
He is the worst.	izy no ratsy indrindra
Things seem easier there.	toa mora kokoa ny zavatra any
Of course, that doesn’t work.	mazava ho azy fa tsy mandeha izany
I'm confused now.	very hevitra aho izao
Like all other types.	toy ny karazana hafa rehetra
The process is very easy and fast.	tena mora sy haingana ny dingana
Seems like it's not even close.	toy ny tsy akaiky akory
I love you pictures.	tiako ianao sary
And yes, they were both minors at the time.	ary eny samy mbola tsy ampy taona izy ireo taminizany
These funds may seem attractive.	mety toa mahafinaritra ireo vola ireo
In general, all of this is true.	aminny ankapobeny dia marina izany rehetra izany
That’s too much for such a simple thing.	be loatra izany ho anny zavatra tsotra toy izany
Even then.	na dia taminizany aza
Yes, right, for sure.	eny marina azo antoka
I used to think a lot.	nieritreritra be aho taloha
And we are still very happy together.	ary mbola faly be izahay miaraka
For others, it seems to go too fast.	aminny hafa toa mandeha haingana loatra
But it is not a game for everyone.	tsy lalao ho anny rehetra anefa
But for us, it’s really bad.	fa ho anay dia tena ratsy tokoa izany
Both can work well.	samy afaka miasa tsara
Because it should.	satria tokony
That is the most important thing.	izay no tena zavadehibe
He didn't like it.	tsy tiany ilay izy
And maybe already.	ary angamba efa
Do what you want, when you want.	ataovy izay tianao rehefa tianao
The house is too close because, yes, it is a house.	akaiky loatra ny trano satria eny trano izy io
However, he does not make things easy.	na izany aza tsy manao zavatra mora izy
He is very lonely.	tena irery izy
I may have made a mistake.	mety nisy diso aho
I did it, and will do it again.	nanao izany aho ary mbola hanao izany indray
Many of them have stories similar to mine.	maro aminizy ireo no manana tantara mitovy amiko
That's the way it is.	izany no fomba ary
But there was something else.	nisy zavatra hafa anefa
I did a good job.	nanao asa tsara aho
But they are kind of special.	fa karazana manokana izy ireo
He really said that.	tena nilaza izany izy
No one deserves it.	tsy misy olona mendrika izany
But this idea is not true.	tsy marina anefa izany hevitra izany
Too much for me.	be loatra amiko
It’s all there.	ao daholo izany
Men have them.	manana azy ireo ny lehilahy
Everything is fun.	mahafinaritra ny zavadrehetra
And look at that.	ary jereo izany
Better idea.	hevitra tsara kokoa
The man was hard to look at.	sarotra ny mijery ilay lehilahy
Or very little.	na tena kely
We had a great time at their location.	nahafinaritra be izahay teo aminny toerana misy azy ireo
So, of course, you like it.	noho izany mazava ho azy tianao izany
She is very good and very full.	tena tsara izy ary tena feno
However, he kept going.	na izany aza dia nandeha foana izy
We are the same.	mitovy ihany izahay
What you know.	izay fantatrao
He had no reason for it.	tsy nanana antony ho azy izy
On the ground.	ao aminny tany
I love good stories.	tiako ny tantara tsara
However, all results are different.	na izany aza ny vokatra rehetra dia tsy mitovy
You are free now.	afaka izao ianao
Maybe not as much as he deserves.	tsy araka izay mendrika azy angamba
Someone loved you.	nisy olona tia anao
And that is why.	ary izany no antony
But they are no more.	tsy ao intsony anefa izy ireo
And that's enough.	ary ampy izany
And now it is about to happen.	ary ankehitriny efa ho tanteraka izany
You may not even know it.	mety tsy ho fantatrao akory izany
You don’t like it, of course.	tsy tianao izany mazava ho azy
He is different in this world, but he is there.	hafa izy eto aminity tontolo ity fa eo izy
Everything else and you come up with an idea.	ny zavatra hafa rehetra ary ianao dia tonga toy ny hevitra
But it was not easy.	tsy mora anefa ilay izy
But the game is still the game.	fa ny lalao dia mbola ny lalao
It’s a personal choice, of course.	safidy manokana izany mazava ho azy
But this is not easy.	tsy mora anefa izany
These may be true.	mety ho marina ireo
I'm crazy, he said.	adala aho hoy izy
But it’s certainly real otherwise.	saingy azo antoka fa tena izy raha tsy izany
Very important, very good.	tena zavadehibe tena tsara
For me.	ho ahy
This is especially true in the first stage.	marina indrindra izany aminny dingana voalohany
Of course they don’t.	mazava ho azy fa tsy manao izany izy ireo
I was on time.	teo aminny fotoana aho
All of this was real.	tena nisy tokoa izany rehetra izany
The possibility of becoming real.	ny mety ho lasa tena misy
There are some options out there.	misy safidy sasany any
Words don’t work.	tsy mandeha ny teny
They surround him with the ground.	manodidina azy aminny tany izy ireo
I know there are others.	fantatro fa mbola misy hafa
They told me they told him.	nilaza tamiko izy ireo fa nilaza taminy izy ireo
Less to lose.	kely kokoa ny ho very
Yes, it is better if we see nothing.	eny tsara kokoa raha tsy mahita na inona na inona isika
He has always needed you.	efa nila anao foana izy
He started walking.	nanomboka nandeha izy
We have an immediate problem.	manana olana eo noho eo isika
This is not good news.	tsy vaovao tsara izany
It's up to you.	ao aminao izany
You could be one of them too.	mety ho iray aminizy ireo koa ianao
He was a little early.	somary aloha izy
But they are not too bad.	saingy tsy dia ratsy loatra izy ireo
See.	mahita
But if you go too far, it’s not okay.	raha mandeha lavitra anefa ianao dia tsy mety izany
No one does that.	tsy misy manao izany
But they did not need it.	tsy nila izany anefa izy ireo
Only one is needed now.	iray ihany no ilaina ankehitriny
This is not an internal movement.	tsy hetsika anatiny izany
Whether you like it or not.	na ho tianao izy na tsy tianao
We both had a great game.	nanana lalao lehibe izahay roa
It's not a thing.	tsy zavatra izany
The first option works well.	ny safidy voalohany dia miasa tsara
He did not come.	tsy tonga izy
It’s so much better.	tena tsara kokoa izany
The choice is ours.	ny safidy dia antsika
Or he may be far away from me.	na mety lavitra ahy izy
Or maybe they never had it.	na angamba tsy nanana izany mihitsy izy ireo
Or no one at all.	na tsy misy olona mihitsy
Very, very familiar and very fast.	tena tena mahazatra ary tena haingana
But you get the idea.	fa azonao ny hevitra
He didn’t really like it.	tsy tena tiany izany
Not for him but for you.	tsy ho azy fa ho anao
He almost did the same.	saika nanao izany koa izy
But we had it.	saingy nanana izany izahay
But this person is fast.	haingana anefa ity olona ity
They had some problems.	nanana olana sasany izy ireo
That will never be a problem now.	tsy ho olana mihitsy izany ankehitriny
And that’s where everything you need to know is.	ary ao no misy ny zavatra rehetra tokony ho fantatrao
If you are different, you are good.	raha hafa ianao dia tsara aminao
A little money maybe.	vola kely angamba
Which was really fun to have.	izay tena nahafinaritra ny nanana
Because he had been without anyone for so long.	satria efa ela be izy no tsy nanana olona
The meaning is very strong.	mafy tokoa ny dikany
Maybe that’s, in fact, your reality.	angamba izany raha ny marina ny zavamisy anao
I hope it’s not too wrong.	manantena aho fa tsy diso loatra ilay izy
Unless that person is completely stupid.	raha tsy hoe tena adala tanteraka io olona io
But he has come a long way.	fa tonga lavitra izy
Type of car.	karazana fiara
The product works well.	miasa tsara ny vokatra
I think he thought better about it.	heveriko fa nieritreritra tsara kokoa momba izany izy
It doesn't seem to work.	toa tsy miasa
Well that is.	eny ary izany
The product really works.	ny vokatra tena miasa
It seems to be getting closer to what it should be.	toa efa akaiky ny tokony ho izy
Or something.	na nisy zavatra
He was almost happy.	saika faly izy
You were great.	nahafinaritra ianao
Clearly, however, the other did not.	mazava anefa fa tsy nanao izany ilay iray
And good for him.	ary tsara ho azy
But don’t get me wrong.	fa aza diso hevitra
I'm not there yet.	tsy mbola any aho
Yes, it is a beautiful land.	eny tany tsara tarehy izy io
I still have mine.	mbola manana ny ahy aho
This was done in two ways.	fomba roa no natao
Not so fast.	tsy dia haingana
No one can do that for him.	tsy misy afaka manao izany ho azy
You need to start where you are now.	mila manomboka aminny toerana misy anao ianao izao
And you didn't tell me.	ary tsy nilaza tamiko ianao
But it has gone too far.	saingy lasa lavitra izany
Better than in the picture.	tsara kokoa noho ny aminny sary
The lower the time, the worse the game.	ny ambany kokoa ny fotoana ny ratsy kokoa ny lalao
You are really alone here.	tena irery ianao eto
Of course they will.	mazava ho azy fa hanao izany izy ireo
I can't have any other ideas.	tsy afaka manana hevitra hafa aho
It can never be wrong.	tsy mety ho diso mihitsy izany
He really needed it.	tena nila izany izy
And no one did anymore.	ary tsy nisy nanao intsony
Maybe we are all too close to him.	angamba isika rehetra dia akaiky azy loatra
You came.	tonga ianao
But it comes almost without meaning.	fa tonga saika tsy misy dikany izany
But that is still a long way off.	mbola lavitra anefa izany
It just doesn’t work.	tsy mandeha fotsiny
For others it will not.	ho anny hafa dia tsy hanao izany
I think you are good.	heveriko fa tsara ianao
And there we were.	dia teo izahay
He never found time.	tsy nahita fotoana mihitsy izy
You shouldn’t do that.	tsy tokony hanao izany ianao
Whatever you want.	na inona na inona tianao
But now they know they won’t do it, not right away.	saingy fantany izao fa tsy hanao izany izy ireo tsy avy hatrany
He never looks at you.	tsy mijery anao mihitsy izy
There was everything that mattered.	teo daholo izay zavadehibe
That’s just not thinking well.	izany ihany no tsy nieritreritra tsara
I said no.	tsia hoy aho
The overall results are the same.	ny vokatra ankapobeny dia mitovy
We didn't do it, man.	tsy nanao izany izahay lehilahy
As it should be.	araka ny tokony ho izy
I don't want to be here.	tsy te ho eto aho
This is not good at all.	tsy tsara mihitsy izany
He looks away.	mijery lavitra izy
No women died.	tsy nisy vehivavy maty
Or it doesn’t suit me.	na tsy mety amiko izany
Nothing else can really be done.	tsy misy zavatra hafa azo atao tokoa
They don’t do it anymore.	tsy manao azy intsony izy ireo
There is always something else you can do.	mbola misy zavatra hafa azonao atao foana
Just don’t, that’s all.	aza fotsiny izay ihany
I am not seen with them.	tsy hita miaraka aminizy ireo aho
There is nothing I would have liked more.	tsy misy na inona na inona ho tiako kokoa
There was nothing around us.	tsy nisy na inona na inona teo aminny manodidina anay
One is now.	ny iray dia aminizao fotoana izao
Some are better of one type, and some of the other.	ny sasany dia tsara kokoa aminny karazana iray ary ny sasany aminny hafa
He stopped when he saw me.	nijanona izy rehefa nahita ahy
I could be big.	mety ho lehibe aho
Do what he wants.	ataovy izay tiany
We have no other money.	tsy manana vola hafa izahay
But in fact, he came.	saingy raha ny marina dia tonga izy
It couldn’t be simpler.	tsy mety ho tsotra kokoa
It is very important to do so.	tena ilaina ny manao izany
Away from me.	lavitra ahy
He is the only man.	izy irery no lehilahy
Then it starts moving very fast.	avy eo dia manomboka mandeha haingana dia haingana
adala! 	adala
All with him.	izay rehetra miaraka aminy
In fact, that's how it should be.	raha ny marina izany no tokony ho izy
So that’s for sure.	noho izany dia azo antoka
She’s really fun about that.	tena mahafinaritra izy aminizany
There was worse news.	nisy vaovao ratsy kokoa
This is work.	izany dia asa
You have to know.	tsy maintsy fantatrao
There’s a lot in it.	be dia be ny ao anatiny
I hadn’t told him that yet, of course.	mbola tsy nilaza izany taminy mazava ho azy
But for some reason you can’t.	saingy noho ny antony iray dia tsy azonao atao
It should be simple.	tokony ho tsotra izany
Maybe I'll get lost there.	ho very any ihany angamba aho
Keep it close.	ataovy akaiky
First, about what is usually done last.	voalohany momba izay matetika atao farany
All, all alone.	rehetra samy irery
It doesn’t have to be perfect.	tsy tokony ho tanteraka izany
And sometimes he knew he would.	ary indraindray dia fantany fa hanao izany izy
I hope everyone will be like that.	manantena aho fa ho toy izany ny rehetra
That seemed to be the best way to do it.	toa izany no fomba tsara indrindra taminizany
There seems to be nothing.	toa tsy misy na inona na inona
Yes, they have something else.	eny manana zavatra hafa izy ireo
Everyone went crazy.	lasa adala ny rehetra
Make it your own.	ataovy manokana izany
I seemed to enjoy it.	toa nahafinaritra ahy izany
Everyone had to be nearby.	tsy maintsy teo akaiky teo ny rehetra
And neither is yours.	ary tsy toy izany koa ny anao
He is a car man.	lehilahy fiara izy
What are you missing ?.	inona no tsy ampy anao
And then it’s not one anymore.	ary avy eo dia tsy iray intsony
I don’t want to know.	tsy tiako ho fantany
Different, different, different.	hafa hafa hafa
Keep it simple and straightforward.	ataovy tsotra sy tsotra izany
He did not harm them.	tsy nanao ratsy azy ireo izy
And doing that process now.	ary manao izany dingana izany aminizao fotoana izao
More fun.	mahafinaritra kokoa
He never thought it would happen.	tsy nieritreritra mihitsy izy hoe ho tonga aminizany
Do things right.	ataovy tsara ny zavatra
You never know what you don’t understand.	tsy fantatrao mihitsy izay tsy azonao
I had to say that, in the end.	tsy maintsy nilaza izany aho taminny farany
This is special.	ity dia manokana
It works, but not now.	miasa izy io fa tsy izao
This is very low.	tena ambany ity
Which might make sense.	izay mety misy dikany
It doesn’t get any bigger than that.	tsy lasa lehibe noho izany
And when you’re not there, it’s really fun.	ary rehefa tsy eo ianao dia tena mahafinaritra
They are almost identical.	saika mitovy izy ireo
There is still enough money.	mbola ampy ny vola
They are not like reality.	tsy toy ny zavamisy izy ireo
As for you.	raha ny momba anao
There must be a first time, he thought.	tsy maintsy misy ny fotoana voalohany hoy izy nieritreritra
It’s not the same as him, actually.	tsy mitovy aminny azy izany raha ny tena marina
This is the war.	izany no ady
Need to start all over again.	mila manomboka indray
It was very different.	tena hafa mihitsy ilay izy
Of course, none of that happened.	mazava ho azy fa tsy nisy izany rehetra izany
All of this is good.	tsara izany rehetra izany
Not to people.	tsy aminny olona
Maybe both.	angamba izy roa
That sounds like a lot.	toa betsaka izany
And make sure it’s real.	ary ataovy azo antoka fa tena izy io
When everything went well.	rehefa nandeha tsara ny zavadrehetra
Everything about it was fun.	nahafinaritra ny zavadrehetra momba izany
because he loves it.	satria tiany izany
And stayed high.	ary nijanona ambony
But the problem is more complicated.	sarotra kokoa anefa ny olana
They look fun, they really are.	toa mahafinaritra izy ireo tena izy ireo
We did it all.	nanao izany rehetra izany izahay
In general, these look good.	aminny ankapobeny dia mijery tsara ireo
But he stopped.	saingy nijanona izy
This is the hardest problem for you.	ity no olana sarotra indrindra aminao
It certainly existed.	azo antoka fa nisy izany
She is a superior woman.	vehivavy ambony izy
But it turns out they can’t.	saingy hita fa tsy afaka izy ireo
And the day will come.	ary ho avy ny andro
It has always been ours.	efa antsika foana
I love them so much.	tiako loatra izy ireo
A lot of problems come along the way, however.	betsaka ny olana tonga aminny lalana na izany aza
I have them all.	manana azy rehetra aho
I want to be wrong.	te ho diso aho
There was never such a thing.	tsy nisy toy izany mihitsy
Just like before.	toy ny taminny fotoana teo aloha mihitsy
It stayed for two days.	roa andro taminizany no nijanona
Just for a reason.	noho ny antony fotsiny
I don't have.	tsy manana
Nothing more could be done.	tsy nisy azo natao intsony
He will do good.	hanao ny tsara izy
It seems to make sense to me.	toa misy dikany amiko izany
It all seems pointless.	toa tsy misy dikany izany rehetra izany
You have a good idea there.	manana hevitra tsara ianao any
Each game has something special to it.	ny lalao tsirairay dia manana zavatra manokana aminizany
Yes, all around us.	eny manodidina antsika rehetra
Especially for you.	indrindra ho anao
She is more beautiful than ever.	tsara tarehy kokoa noho ny taloha izy
I need to go.	mila mandeha aho
Ours is very good.	tena tsara ny anay
The years did not go by by themselves.	tsy nandeha ho azy ny taona
For some reason, it doesn’t work.	noho ny antony sasany dia tsy mandeha izany
She knew she was beautiful.	fantany fa tsara tarehy izy
Not really, but almost.	tsy tena fa saika
Nothing wrong was done, no.	tsy misy ratsy natao tsia
This house had something for everyone.	ity trano ity dia nanana zavatra ho anny rehetra
This is only the first step.	io ihany no dingana voalohany
Fun or not.	mahafinaritra na tsia
I'm really not happy.	tena tsy faly aho
It seems like years ago.	toa efa taona lasa izay
You might like it.	mety ho tianao izany
This is one of those times.	izao no iray aminireo fotoana ireo
But there is a big problem with that.	saingy misy olana lehibe aminizany
And in fact, they are not wrong on any issue.	ary raha ny marina tsy diso izy ireo aminny olana rehetra
A man needs his place.	mila ny toerana misy azy ny lehilahy iray
He can't either.	tsy afaka koa izy
We couldn’t do anything for him.	tsy afaka nanao na inona na inona ho azy izahay
It doesn’t seem hard to do, and it isn’t.	toa tsy sarotra ny manao izany ary tsy izany
I might die now.	mety maty aho izao
And then he had to tell the truth.	ary avy eo dia tsy maintsy nilaza ny marina izy
It really goes a long way.	tena mandeha lavitra izany
But not recently.	saingy tsy vao haingana
Or his, but he had to do it.	na ny azy fa tsy maintsy nanao izany izy
They want to be good, they want to be great.	te ho tsara izy ireo te ho lehibe
Of course, this is a wrong idea.	mazava ho azy fa hevitra diso izany
I want to be a good man.	te ho lehilahy tsara aho
That’s too much for me.	be loatra amiko izany
You are not bad.	tsy ratsy ianao
Yes, a lot of people don’t like that.	eny maro ny olona tsy tia izany
And he knew it was true.	ary fantany fa marina izany
It certainly wouldn’t be too bad.	azo antoka fa tsy ho ratsy loatra izany
I think you will be happy.	heveriko fa ho faly ianao
We can do this in two ways.	afaka manao izany aminny fomba roa isika
He does, but only a little.	manao izany izy saingy kely fotsiny
That's a crazy idea.	hevitra adala izany
But that doesn’t matter.	tsy zavadehibe anefa izany
Good for me.	tsara ho ahy
And two died.	ary roa no maty
You know this is where you are, where you are.	fantatrao fa io no toerana misy anao izay misy anao
No, he didn't.	tsia tsy nanao izany izy
It does it all.	manao izany rehetra izany
And at the bottom.	ary eo aminny farany ambany
They make choices.	manao safidy izy ireo
This is true but not true.	marina izany fa tsy marina
Watch it with the people you love.	jereo miaraka aminny olona tianao izany
So again.	ka indray
In fact, they have never loved him.	raha ny marina dia mbola tsy tia azy mihitsy izy ireo
I was little before I saw him.	kely kely aho vao nahita azy
You can do it the old -fashioned way if you like.	afaka manao izany aminny fomba taloha ianao raha tianao
No, there was another time.	tsia nisy fotoana hafa
Just for me.	ho ahy ihany
I know, and I don’t see what’s wrong.	fantatro ary tsy hitako izay ratsy
And yes, here they are.	ary eny eto izy ireo
We have enough money.	manana vola ampy izahay
I do that sometimes.	manao izany aho indraindray
He just seemed to be thinking.	toa nieritreritra fotsiny izy
That's all.	izany fotsiny
One night and one day.	indray alina ary iray andro
Not enough words.	tsy ampy teny
And you come to the wrong place.	ary tonga aminny toerana tsy mety ianao
Right now, that’s a real job.	aminizao fotoana izao dia tena asa izany
And life.	ary ny fiainana
It looked like a man.	toa lehilahy ilay izy
And he is the most important.	ary izy no tena zavadehibe
In fact, little can be done.	raha ny marina dia kely ny azo natao
Then he thought a little.	dia nieritreritra kely izy
They immediately left.	avy hatrany dia lasa izy ireo
She has a story with him.	manana tantara miaraka aminy izy
He is very low.	tena ambany izy
Here we are again.	izao indray isika izao
I had one day.	nanana indray andro aho
Lots of things.	betsaka ny zavatra
He just loves it.	tiany fotsiny izany
We are the only one to come.	iray ihany isika no ho avy
You can’t because it doesn’t exist.	tsy afaka ianao satria tsy misy izany
He doesn't look at her.	tsy mijery azy izy
Very much.	tena betsaka
There was no other meaning.	tsy nisy dikany hafa
There was nothing out of it.	tsy nisy na inona na inona avy taminizany
But the reality is they are not.	saingy ny zavamisy dia tsy izy ireo
And he said for sure.	ary hoy izy azo antoka
However.	na dia izany aza
always, and again.	foana ary indray
I am free at any time of the day or night.	afaka aho aminny fotoana rehetra na andro na alina
I enjoyed life.	nahafinaritra ahy ny fiainana
I have seen it all.	efa hitako daholo izany rehetra izany
But others have.	fa ny hafa manana
But he does nothing about it.	saingy tsy manao na inona na inona aminizany izy
That's the game.	izany no lalao
We stayed there.	nijanona tao izahay
Sure you can do that if you want.	azo antoka fa azonao atao izany raha tianao
It could be you.	mety ho ianao izany
It was a simple question.	fanontaniana tsotra ilay izy
But nothing hard.	fa tsy misy mafy
He always loved it well.	tiany tsara foana
Very happy for him.	faly be ho azy
It was a different job than before.	asa hafa noho ny teo aloha izany
Really fun, and just money.	tena mahafinaritra ary vola ihany
When you earn money in real time.	rehefa mahazo vola aminny fotoana tena izy
These are good for events.	tsara ho anny hetsika ireo
He could never be different.	tsy ho afaka ny ho hafa mihitsy izy
But it was still fun.	saingy mbola nahafinaritra ihany izany
You have been there.	efa teo ianao
I don't go there anymore.	tsy mandeha any intsony aho
This next part, however, is the worst.	ity ampahany manaraka ity anefa no ratsy indrindra
Money is a big part of that.	ny vola dia ampahany betsaka aminizany
There are three, he said.	misy telo hoy izy
These are the real facts.	ireo no zavamisy marina
The game itself is just too big.	ny lalao mihitsy no lehibe loatra
And no, you’re not.	ary tsia tsy izany ianao
Make me harder.	ataovy mafy kokoa aho
I didn't say anything else to him.	tsy nilaza zavatra hafa taminy aho
Not all the time low but too close.	tsy ny fotoana rehetra ambany fa akaiky loatra
He is a very nice man.	tena lehilahy mahafinaritra izy
It’s always a pointless place.	toerana tsy misy dikany foana ilay izy
Nothing can be done.	tsy misy azo atao
It works really well.	tena miasa tsara izany
They enjoy doing it.	mahafinaritra azy ireo ny manao izany
It never died.	tsy maty mihitsy ilay izy
Even now, he couldn’t stop.	na dia izao aza dia tsy afaka nijanona izy
He doesn’t like that place.	tsy tiany io toerana io
And so must you.	ary tsy maintsy toy izany koa ianao
It’s a real thing.	tena zavatra izany
It is not seen in the picture.	tsy hita eto aminny sary izany
Each day is a new day.	ny andro tsirairay dia andro vaovao
It's not too far away.	tsy dia lavitra loatra izao
The truth is.	ny marina dia
He is still there.	mbola ao izy
I looked around.	nijery manodidina aho
They just came.	tonga fotsiny izy ireo
It’s also a routine job.	asa mahazatra ihany koa
And do it fast.	ary ataovy haingana
It already is.	efa izy io
They all died too.	maty koa izy rehetra
Both do.	samy manao izany
Of course, this is not new.	mazava ho azy fa tsy vaovao izany
He seems to have died for it.	toa maty noho izany izy
Something real and familiar.	zavatra tena izy sy mahazatra
This is a more difficult task than it seems.	ity dia asa sarotra kokoa noho ny toa azy
Quick and easy food.	sakafo haingana sy mora
It is not meant to be the same.	tsy natao ho toy izany koa
Money is essential to life.	tena ilaina aminny fiainana ny vola
They didn’t have it before.	tsy nanana izany izy ireo taloha
He had a big problem.	nanana olana lehibe izy
You can't go wrong.	tsy mety diso ianao
And there were the cars.	ary teo ireo fiara
He is not far away.	tsy lavitra izy
But only in part.	ampahany ihany anefa
From a distance, it always seems.	raha avy lavitra dia toa foana
And then came the worst part.	ary avy eo dia tonga ny ampahany ratsy indrindra
We are one now.	iray ihany isika izao
Women look at him that way.	vehivavy mijery azy toy izany
But it works well for me.	mandeha tsara amiko anefa izany
You wouldn’t be gone without them.	tsy ho lasa ianao raha tsy nisy azy ireo
But you know too much.	be loatra anefa ny zavatra fantatrao
So that's good.	ka tsara izany
We looked at him.	nijery azy izahay
He needed a way.	nila lalana izy
There are so many.	misy be dia be
It never works.	tsy mandeha mihitsy izany
But there are bad ways there.	fa misy fomba ratsy any
They really love him.	tena tia azy izy ireo
One, and only one.	iray ary iray ihany
Probably the first choice.	angamba ny safidy voalohany
Here someone died, and recently.	eto dia nisy olona maty ary vao haingana
But you are one for.	fa ianao dia iray ho anny
The coming year will be no different.	tsy hisy hafa ny taona ho avy
Life as it could have been.	ny fiainana araka izay mety ho nisy
I do not.	tsy manao izany aho
He did all this without a single one.	nanao izany rehetra izany tsy nisy na dia iray aza izy
That is.	izany hoe
I thought.	nieritreritra aho
Anything about it.	na inona na inona momba izany
These are real facts.	tena zavamisy ireo
No problem for me in any way.	tsy misy olana amiko aminny fomba rehetra
Either way, it doesn’t make sense.	na izany na tsy izany tsy misy dikany izany
I found the right part quickly and easily.	hitako haingana sy mora ny ampahany marina
And that’s a good fit.	ary mety tsara izany
In a slightly different way.	aminny fomba hafa kely
Others should not.	ny hafa tsy tokony
Or in one of them.	na aminny iray aminizy ireo
I am alone on this journey.	irery aho aminity dia ity
Not the same.	tsy mitovy
However, they are not very happy.	na izany aza tsy dia faly loatra izy ireo
There is one last thing.	misy zavatra iray farany
The time has come.	tonga izao ny fotoana
But that doesn't matter right now.	tsy zavadehibe anefa izany aminizao fotoana izao
They look fun.	toa mahafinaritra izy ireo
But it wasn’t designed specifically.	saingy tsy natao manokana izany
I will come to those.	ho tonga aminireo aho
Very happy when the end comes.	faly be rehefa tonga ny farany
They told me that.	nilaza izany tamiko izy ireo
Some of them are beautiful too.	ny sasany aminizy ireo dia tsara tarehy koa
I haven’t seen it in full yet.	mbola tsy nahita azy feno aho
But it will be worth it in the end.	fa ho mendrika izany aminny farany
Not food either.	tsy sakafo ihany koa
It stopped.	nijanona izany
I have never looked at them.	tsy mbola nijery azy ireo mihitsy aho
The picture goes very fast.	mandeha haingana be ny sary
However, negative outcomes are unlikely.	na izany aza ny vokatra ratsy dia tsy azo antoka
I have to do something good.	tsy maintsy manao zavatra tsara aho
We’ve done a lot before and it’s fun !.	efa nanao be dia be izahay taloha ary mahafinaritra
But in fact, they are not.	saingy raha ny marina dia tsy izy ireo
It comes with its own problems.	tonga miaraka aminny olana misy azy manokana izy io
It's time for you.	fotoana izao ianao
I work long hours.	miasa ela aho
But it also makes sense.	misy dikany koa anefa izany
That’s how everything is.	toy izany ny zavadrehetra
Maybe we should.	angamba tokony ho isika
He almost said something else.	saika nilaza zavatra hafa izy
It might have been better for him.	mety ho tsara kokoa ho azy izany
He needed us.	nila antsika izy
But that’s not exactly the word.	saingy tsy izany tanteraka ilay teny
It won't be bad.	tsy ho ratsy izany
To me, that doesn’t really matter.	amiko dia tsy dia zavadehibe loatra izany
It was harder for him than for me.	sarotra taminy noho ny ahy ilay izy
There where he is for sure.	any ny toerana misy azy dia azo antoka
We want to go there.	te ho any izahay
That was true then and now.	marina izany taminizany ary aminizao fotoana izao
I love you.	tiako ianao
Maybe he still doesn’t deserve it.	angamba mbola tsy mendrika izy
It was a bit crazy.	somary adala ihany ilay izy
They saw him, stopped.	nahita azy izy ireo nijanona
More importantly.	zavadehibe kokoa
These are difficult issues.	resaka sarotra ireo
It seems the right time has come.	toa tonga ny fotoana mety
He walks.	izy no mandeha
And yet she is still beautiful.	ary na izany aza dia mbola tsara tarehy ihany izy
Life did not go well then.	tsy nandeha tsara ny fiainana taminizany
Probably not very appropriate.	tsy mety loatra angamba
That’s really good.	tena tsara tokoa izany
The woman is small.	kely kely ilay vehivavy
I won't be there tonight.	tsy ho any intsony aho anio alina
That's the way, he thought.	izany no fomba hoy izy nieritreritra
He needed a safe house.	nila trano azo antoka izy
In fact, it’s harder than that.	raha ny marina sarotra kokoa noho izany
I really can't thank you.	tena tsy afaka misaotra anao
He seemed to have somewhere.	toa nanana tany ho any izy
I’ve thought a lot about it.	efa nieritreritra be momba izany aho
They are no more.	tsy hita intsony izy ireo
Nothing else matters.	tsy misy dikany ny zavatra hafa
I had no idea about it.	tsy nanana hevitra momba izany aho
There was no good news.	tsy nisy vaovao tsara
When you work on the process.	rehefa miasa aminny dingana ianao
Mine looks like this.	ny ahy dia toa izao
Or maybe not you.	na mety tsy ianao
Yes, it will not happen.	eny tsy ho tanteraka izany
But here we are.	saingy eto isika
You do a good job and these games are fun.	manao asa tsara ianao ary mahafinaritra ireo lalao ireo
This part is true.	marina io ampahany io
And they don’t seem happy.	ary toa tsy faly izy ireo
This is also meant for history.	ity koa dia natao ho anny tantara
Because if we don’t, no one will do it.	satria raha tsy manao izany isika dia tsy hisy hanao izany
And life is good here.	ary tsara ny fiainana eto
But that doesn't work out that way.	tsy mandeha toy izany anefa izany
It can also be very personal.	mety ho tena manokana koa izany
None of these.	tsy misy aminireo
It will not be good for you.	tsy ho tsara ho anao izany
Yes, women have them too.	eny manana azy ireo koa ny vehivavy
But that is not the case.	saingy tsy izany no izy
In two works.	aminny asa roa
I have a job.	manana asa
Like dead.	toy ny maty
And it can be done.	ary azo natao izany
I couldn’t do the process.	tsy afaka nanao ny dingana aho
I can do that too.	afaka manao izany koa aho
Something different and minimal.	zavatra tsy mitovy ary kely indrindra
And a lot of people.	ary betsaka ny olona
I love everyone.	tiako ny olona rehetra
You have to be beautiful once.	tsy maintsy ho tsara tarehy ianao indray mandeha
It’s harder than anything.	sarotra noho ny zavatra rehetra izany
Worse at night.	ratsy kokoa aminny alina
It’s just that easy.	mora fotsiny izany
But we don’t.	tsy manao izany anefa izahay
They are really big.	tena lehibe izy ireo
No one got a job there.	tsy nisy nahazo asa tany
I think they are really good.	heveriko fa tena tsara izy ireo
I knew he was no longer happy with me.	fantatro fa tsy faly tamiko intsony izy
This may be the most important thing.	mety ho io no tena zavadehibe
This, of course, is a problem.	izany mazava ho azy dia olana
Don’t do it !.	aza manao izany
That sounds good.	izay toa tsara
But it is still young.	mbola kely anefa
It's a small house.	trano kely io
I love watching them.	tiako ny mijery azy ireo
The world seems like too big a place.	toa toerana lehibe loatra izao tontolo izao
The product is in place.	ny vokatra dia eo aminny toerana
So we will do the following.	noho izany dia hanao izao manaraka izao isika
Hope you get it.	manantena ianao fa azonao izany
But they still made money.	mbola nahazo vola ihany anefa izy ireo
But they go a long way.	saingy mandeha lavitra izy ireo
This is wrong again.	diso indray izany
But we don’t come to that question.	saingy tsy tonga aminizany fanontaniana izany isika
Lost in the past but found again.	very taloha fa hita indray izao
They found the same thing.	nahita zavatra mitovy izy ireo
I don’t like these at all.	tsy tiako mihitsy ireo
But that’s still too much.	saingy mbola betsaka loatra izany
There are no good results.	tsy misy vokatra tsara
They don’t need it.	tsy mila azy izy ireo
And we really have to go together.	ary tena tsy maintsy mandeha miaraka isika
For more money as well.	ho anny vola bebe kokoa ihany koa
Both can be good choices.	samy mety ho safidy tsara
He may die too.	mety maty koa izy
We hope it will be faster.	manantena izahay fa ho haingana kokoa
He’s not too much.	tsy dia be loatra izy
They were meaningless.	tsy nisy dikany izy ireo
I hope you know what it is.	manantena aho fa fantatrao hoe inona izany
They are now dead.	efa maty izy ireo izao
It’s like we got something.	toy ny nahazo zavatra isika
As usual.	toy ny mahazatra
Same in many ways, yes, but not the same.	mitovy aminny fomba maro eny fa tsy mitovy
They alone had a choice.	izy ireo ihany no nanana safidy
The days are gone.	lasa ny andro
But, we couldn’t do that.	saingy tsy afaka nanao izany izahay
This seems to be the better option.	toa izany no safidy tsara kokoa
He is meaningless.	tsy misy dikany izy
To some people, we seem crazy.	aminny olona sasany dia toa adala isika
Someone starts me.	misy manomboka ahy
Now, it’s really hard to do it alone.	ankehitriny tena sarotra ny manao irery
Now he is gone.	ankehitriny dia lasa izy
It just really works.	tena miasa fotsiny
We have to do it.	tsy maintsy manao izany isika
But there was still time.	mbola nisy fotoana anefa
He had no problem.	tsy nanana olana izy
He came to hers.	tonga tao aminny azy izy
Home is no small task.	tsy asa kely ny trano
And two more.	ary roa hafa
This is not entirely true.	tsy marina tanteraka izany
It’s as if it doesn’t exist.	toy ny hoe tsy misy izany
We have to start everything.	tsy maintsy manomboka ny zavadrehetra isika
So, they won’t do it.	noho izany tsy hanao izany izy ireo
You know that part.	fantatrao io ampahany io
It can be very difficult to get them.	mety ho sarotra be ny mahazo azy ireo
You don’t have to do anything.	tsy mila manao na inona na inona ianao
No, he found himself.	tsia nahita ny tenany izy
New job right away.	asa vaovao avy hatrany
However, this can be very difficult at first.	na izany aza mety ho sarotra be izany aloha
What to do and especially to watch.	ny atao ary indrindra ny mijery
And of course they are right.	ary mazava ho azy fa marina izy ireo
Although they exist.	na dia misy aza izy ireo
He looked around at everyone there.	nijery manodidina ny olona rehetra teo izy
You can do two.	afaka manao roa ianao
Never walk alone.	aza mandeha irery mihitsy
But just do it.	fa ataovy fotsiny
This is not a difficult process, in fact.	tsy dingana sarotra izany raha ny marina
I can't be like that.	tsy afaka ny ho toy izany aho
It will be difficult to do so.	ho sarotra ny nanao izany
We have all had something similar.	efa nisy zavatra toy izany koa isika rehetra
I really like the type and the people in it.	tena tiako ilay karazana sy ny olona ao anatiny
They are just happy.	faly fotsiny izy ireo
He can make you a nice guy tonight.	afaka manao anao ho lehilahy mahafinaritra izy anio alina
It seems appropriate in a way.	toa mety aminny fomba iray izany
And a little happy.	ary faly kely
This is the next step.	izany no dingana manaraka
I said to some people.	hoy aho olona sasany
There are so many of them.	be dia be ny toy izany
Then it was gone.	dia lasa izany
It was late at night again.	efa alina be indray izany
Generally they will not.	aminny ankapobeny dia tsy hanao izany izy ireo
It’s wrong because it’s not true.	tsy mety izany satria tsy marina
He knew they weren't.	fantany fa tsy izy ireo
This is the real result.	izany no vokatra marina
It’s just like everything else.	toy ny zavatra hafa rehetra ihany izany
He is the same age as me.	efa mitovy taona amiko izy
Something was always lost.	nisy zavatra very foana
It doesn’t matter to me.	tsy misy zavadehibe amiko
But no one.	saingy tsy nisy olona
It’s hard work.	asa mafy izany
This is a very good year for us.	tena taona tsara ho antsika izany
They could be both.	mety ho samy izy
And as not.	ary toy ny tsy
No, it may not be the best.	tsia mety tsy ny tsara indrindra
And you know, you might be right.	ary fantatrao mety ho marina ianao
Maybe work on one of them.	angamba miasa aminny iray aminizy ireo
Nothing goes.	tsy misy na inona na inona mandeha
Much, much easier.	be mora kokoa
Didn't think it was good.	tsy nieritreritra fa tsara
However, it is not as large as it looks.	na izany aza tsy dia lehibe araka ny hita
That’s the most fun thing.	izany no zavatra mahafinaritra indrindra
These places are too busy.	be atao loatra ireo toerana ireo
She is not an ugly woman.	tsy vehivavy ratsy tarehy izy
See also the other one.	jereo koa ilay iray
Just a little bit goes a long way.	kely fotsiny dia lasa lavitra
He is still high.	mbola ambony izy
I was wrong.	diso aho
Not everything is like that.	tsy ny zavatra rehetra no toy izany
People need it.	olona mila izany
That’s what he likes best.	izany no tiany indrindra
You love him.	tia azy ianao
It’s not that they won’t know.	tsy hoe tsy ho fantany akory
It's been a long time.	efa ela be izany
Do the same over and over again.	ataovy toy izany hatrany hatrany
It seems impossible.	toa tsy misy azo atao izany
They are not as beautiful as I am.	tsy hoe tsara tarehy toa ahy izy ireo
But it had to happen.	tsy maintsy nisy anefa izany
But he was not lost.	saingy tsy very hevitra izy
I hope he is happy.	manantena aho fa faly izy
Too good to be true.	tsara loatra raha marina izany
All of this is common.	matetika izany rehetra izany
Not everyone can get to it.	tsy ny rehetra no mety ho tonga aminizany
Or next year.	na ny taona manaraka izany
He may not come.	mety tsy ho tonga izy
In doing so, he is wrong.	aminizany dia diso izy
Make that part work.	ataovy miasa io ampahany io
But this does not seem to be true.	toa tsy marina anefa izany
It doesn’t seem fun.	toa tsy mahafinaritra
More to come.	betsaka kokoa no ho avy
There was something like that.	nisy zavatra toy izany
Of course, we don’t have anything like that.	mazava ho azy fa tsy manana zavatra toy izany isika
Like you, really.	toa anao tena
If you are really right, this is the right path.	raha tena marina ianao dia ity no lalana marina
That's a good idea.	hevitra tsara izay
The method is also a bit simpler and easier.	ny fomba ihany koa dia somary mora sy mora kokoa
Didn't see anything, actually.	tsy nahita na inona na inona raha ny marina
This one may be a good choice for you.	ity iray ity dia mety ho safidy mety aminao
It’s pretty safe and fast.	somary azo antoka sy haingana izy io
They are different about each other.	samy hafa ny momba azy ireo
Not to everyone, to the world.	tsy aminny tsirairay aminizao tontolo izao
I don’t want to do too much.	tsy te hanao be loatra aho
He is, and he loves it.	izy no izy ary tiany izany
The former is the most common.	ny voalohany dia mahazatra indrindra
It wasn't a good night.	tsy alina tsara izany
It’s not too big so it goes well too.	tsy dia lehibe loatra ka mandeha tsara ihany koa
Very good location as well.	tena tsara toerana ihany koa
But overall, the night was good.	fa aminny ankapobeny dia tsara ny alina
Not only that.	tsy izay ihany
I have no food.	tsy manana sakafo aho
and both for him.	ary samy ho azy koa
I always have a choice.	manana safidy foana aho
See the truth.	jereo ny marina
But he knew it well.	saingy fantany tsara izany
But a great place.	fa toerana lehibe
But I won’t.	tsy ho aho anefa
Yes, he will do better next time.	eny hanao tsara kokoa izy aminny manaraka
Not a picture.	tsy sary
This idea can be difficult.	ity hevitra ity dia mety ho sarotra
It may also be close.	mety ho akaiky ihany koa
We have to do both.	tsy maintsy manao ny roa isika
He found no other way.	tsy nahita fomba hafa izy
We need someone else.	mila olona iray hafa izahay
I have no other idea.	tsy manana hevitra hafa aho
It will be better.	dia ho tsara kokoa ny
It was really good at first.	tena tsara aloha ilay izy
Thank you so much to them.	misaotra betsaka azy ireo
But don’t get me wrong.	fa aza diso hevitra aho
But here’s the story.	fa izao ny tantara
So it was new to me.	ka dia vaovao tamiko ilay izy
It’s not pretty at all but it works.	tsy tsara tarehy mihitsy fa miasa
This is old news.	vaovao taloha ity
Yes, that’s a great idea.	eny hevitra tsara indrindra izany
It's faster.	haingana kokoa izany
Really, really soon.	tena tena tsy ho ela
What, he didn’t know.	inona tsy fantany
They will be here for two days.	roa andro izy ireo no ho eto
I looked at you.	nijery anao aho
Women of all kinds.	vehivavy aminny karazana
It only works when you’re not looking.	miasa ihany rehefa tsy mijery ianao
That too, yes.	izany koa eny
Maybe you don’t understand some of them.	angamba tsy azonao ny sasany aminizy ireo
Because we never do that.	satria tsy manao izany mihitsy izahay
These are true.	marina ireo
I love this approach.	tiako ity fomba ity
It wasn’t the night he knew.	tsy io no alina fantany
Nothing is certain in this world.	tsy misy zavatra azo antoka eto aminity tontolo ity
They are still good people.	mbola olona tsara ihany izy ireo
It’s really nothing more than that.	tsy tena zavatra hafa noho izany
I was glad he was there.	faly aho fa teo izy
So we got there.	ka tonga any izahay
Time goes by.	mandeha ny fotoana
He wants everyone to love him.	tiany ho tia azy ny olona rehetra
Not too much, but more than before.	tsy dia be loatra fa mihoatra noho ny teo aloha
But he was free.	afaka anefa izy
It’s certainly not very pretty but it works well.	azo antoka fa tsy dia tsara tarehy izy io fa miasa tsara
Next year, maybe, maybe not.	aminny taona manaraka angamba mety tsy
I haven’t seen many people yet.	mbola tsy nahita olona be dia be aho
But now he was far away, lost to her.	saingy lavitra izy izao very taminy
What a job.	inona ilay asa
And, of course, everything is fine.	ary azo antoka tsara ny zavadrehetra
However, there are others.	na izany aza mbola misy hafa
Yes, some of them.	eny ny sasany aminizy ireo
Those who love him may begin to love him.	ireo izay tia azy dia mety manomboka tia azy
It didn’t make sense.	tsy nisy dikany
But, at first, it wasn’t easy.	saingy aminny voalohany dia tsy mora izany
They deserve one.	mendrika ny iray izy ireo
He still has it.	mbola manana ihany izy
They were both fun.	samy nahafinaritra izy ireo
You just did that stupid thing.	nanao anio adala io fotsiny ianao
Which doesn’t mean anything.	izay tsy misy dikany na inona na inona
Another can come.	afaka tonga ny iray hafa
Age is probably the reason.	ny taona angamba no antony
The land is beautiful.	tsara tarehy ny tany
They look at it.	mijery izany izy ireo
The method is quite simple and fast.	ny fomba dia somary tsotra sy haingana
Perhaps there is no such word at all.	angamba tsy misy teny toy izany mihitsy
There will be problems, then.	hisy olana araka izany
The process is unusual.	tsy mahazatra ny dingana
But I enjoy it.	mahafinaritra ahy anefa izany
I will never be lost again.	tsy ho very intsony aho
I just lost my job.	vao very asa aho
No one knew he did it.	tsy misy olona fantany fa nanao izany
I need more of both.	mila bebe kokoa aminizy roa aho
Now he knows better.	ankehitriny dia fantany tsara
The man is gone.	lasa ilay lehilahy
There was a new movement.	nisy hetsika vaovao
So that's not true.	ka tsy marina
The former dead.	ny maty taloha
it's clear night.	alina mazava izao
Bad idea, bad.	hevitra ratsy ratsy
The woman saw him do it.	nahita azy nanao izany ilay vehivavy
It could be faster.	mety ho haingana kokoa izany
I could have thought of one.	afaka nieritreritra iray aho
We will all be better off than that.	ho tsara kokoa noho izany isika rehetra
I should be fine.	tokony ho tsara aho
Women are so much more than that.	ny vehivavy dia mihoatra lavitra noho izany
They have already made one.	efa nanao iray izy ireo
Part of it, however.	ny ampahany aminy na izany aza
He became thinking of me.	lasa nieritreritra ahy izy
He is the reality.	izy no zavamisy
But they are all very, very bad.	fa izy rehetra dia tena ratsy be
But for the most part, they had no choice.	saingy aminny ankapobeny dia tsy nanana safidy izy ireo
They all come, and they all go.	tonga izy rehetra ary mandeha daholo
That's not the only reason they exist.	tsy noho ny aminizany ihany no misy azy ireo
It should have, perhaps.	tokony ho nanana angamba
But he was wrong.	diso hevitra anefa izy
Or maybe all of them, over time.	na angamba izy rehetra rehefa mandeha ny fotoana
A world where you know nothing.	tontolo izay tsy fantatrao na inona na inona
Do what? 	hanao inona
And if he didn't.	ary raha tsy nanao izany izy
The last three are not in this picture.	tsy eto aminity sary ity ny telo farany
That would be the wrong approach.	mety ho fomba tsy mety izany
I had never thought of anything like that.	mbola tsy nieritreritra zavatra toy izany mihitsy aho
Game after game.	lalao ny lalao
This is very common.	tena mahazatra izany
I’ve done that and done other things.	efa nanao izany aho ary nanao zavatra hafa
And that process is very important.	ary tena ilaina izany dingana izany
It has to be money.	tsy maintsy vola izany
Something is missing.	zavatra tsy ampy
We are not like that.	tsy mba toy izany izahay
There is no need anymore.	tsy misy ilaina intsony
It’s really fun, really fun stuff.	tena mahafinaritra ilay izy zavatra tena mahafinaritra
And that’s a big reason.	ary antony lehibe izany
So it’s more appropriate.	noho izany dia mety kokoa
He came, he said.	tonga izy hoy izy
It has to be.	tsy maintsy izany no izy
I hope not tonight.	manantena aho fa tsy anio alina
People need to see that.	mila mahita izany ny olona
This is a really crazy thing.	tena zavatra adala izany
I looked at them both.	nijery azy roa aho
They lost their homes, cars, and jobs.	very trano sy fiara ary asa izy ireo
You are wrong there.	diso ianao any
They are ours.	antsika izy ireo
But if you work with people.	fa raha miasa aminny olona ianao
We can do that.	afaka manao izany isika
Way, harder.	fomba sarotra kokoa
I really don’t want to be alone now.	tena tsy te ho irery aho izao
Then I got the picture.	dia nahazo ahy ilay sary
And you are not alone.	ary tsy ianao ihany
And just for two words.	ary noho ny teny roa fotsiny
But beautiful.	fa tsara tarehy
We have three.	manana telo izahay
And that is not possible.	ary tsy azo atao izany
He had to go.	tsy maintsy nandeha izy
I have yet to see him happy.	mbola tsy nahita azy faly aho
That seems like a safe path.	toa lalana azo antoka izany
It’s hard to find another way.	sarotra ny mahita fomba hafa
I'm not about that.	tsy momba izany aho
And it will always be in the wrong place.	ary ho eo aminny toerana tsy mety foana izany
He didn't think of anything.	tsy nieritreritra na inona na inona izy
Sometimes, though, they are wrong.	indraindray anefa dia diso izy ireo
But someone needs to look at it.	mila misy mijery azy anefa
But we need something more.	saingy mila zavatra bebe kokoa isika
But that is the only reason.	fa izay ihany no antony
Thank you for thinking about it.	misaotra anao nieritreritra izany
Not just one or two men.	tsy lehilahy iray na roa ihany
There was no one.	tsy nisy olona
They have just arrived.	vao tonga izy ireo
It could be almost anything.	mety ho saika na inona na inona
But it's not good.	fa tsy tsara ilay izy
I know him a little.	fantatro kely izy
Lots, lots of good.	be dia be tena tsara
I had never seen anyone so close before.	mbola tsy nahita olona akaiky toy izany aho taloha
In the end, this is the place to be.	aminny farany ity no toerana tokony hisy
It seems so simple.	toa tsotra be izany
I don't want to do anything.	tsy te hanao na inona na inona aho
Very recently.	tena tsy ela akory izay
He will still be here.	mbola ho eto ihany izy
It doesn’t seem too big.	toa tsy dia lehibe loatra izany
Everything seemed to stop.	toa nijanona ny zavadrehetra
It has become a very easy process.	lasa fomba tena mora izany
I really did.	tena nanao izany aho
And it’s not always that simple.	ary tsy tsotra foana izany
But he still has his own.	mbola manana ny azy anefa izy
I just don’t see it.	tsy hitako fotsiny izany
And it may even be possible.	ary mety ho azo atao mihitsy aza izany
He looked at her and was lost.	nijery azy izy ka very
He started walking again.	nanomboka nandeha indray izy
Don’t go too low.	aza mandeha ambany loatra
He made good choices for himself.	nanao safidy tsara ho anny tenany izy
He needs one.	mila iray izy
Then it begins.	dia manomboka izany
You should be happy about that too.	tokony ho faly aminizany koa ianao
Do it again.	ataovy indray
This is how life is.	toy izao ny fiainana
I hope you get to know him well soon.	manantena aho fa ho fantatrao tsara izy tsy ho ela
Yes, it is very similar to his.	eny tena mitovy aminny azy ilay izy
I was wrong.	diso hevitra aho
But it will get there one day.	fa ho tonga any indray andro any
But it exists with everything.	saingy misy izany miaraka aminny zavadrehetra
Everything is in it.	ao anatiny ny zavadrehetra
It is not meant for everyone.	tsy natao ho anny rehetra izany
These men looked at me closely.	nijery ahy akaiky ireo lehilahy ireo
But they are not.	saingy tsy izy ireo
But they never do that.	tsy manao izany mihitsy anefa izy ireo
He must know if they are.	tsy maintsy fantany raha toa azy ireo
I have been there a long time.	efa ela aho no teo
There is something more important.	misy zavadehibe kokoa
And there he is.	ary eo izy
I should have stayed with two.	tokony nijanona taminny roa aho
You don’t need difficult moves.	tsy mila hetsika sarotra ianao
I was never like that before.	tsy mba toy izany mihitsy aho taloha
He now saw a face.	nahita tarehy izy izao
Very, very hard.	tena mafy be
They just do work.	miasa asa fotsiny izy ireo
It was a first for me.	voalohany ho ahy izany
It was all so much fun.	nahafinaritra be daholo izany
That is not the case today.	tsy izany no zavamisy aminizao fotoana izao
But we still had food.	mbola nanana sakafo ihany anefa izahay
No one was looking at him.	tsy nisy nijery azy
And more, and more, and more.	ary bebe kokoa ary bebe kokoa ary bebe kokoa
Your location is not.	ny toerana misy anao dia tsy
We may not come to all of these problems.	mety tsy ho tonga aminireo olana rehetra ireo isika
It was a fun and exciting time.	fotoana mahafinaritra sy mahafinaritra izany
Nowhere else can they be.	tsy misy toerana hafa mety hisy azy ireo
I do a really good job.	manao asa tena tsara aho
Only when they do that to you do you know.	rehefa manao izany aminao izy ireo vao fantatrao
I should have stayed there.	tokony nijanona tany aho
Some do things for him over time.	misy manao zavatra ho azy rehefa mandeha ny fotoana
He works a lot.	miasa betsaka izy
I really like it.	tena tiako tokoa
But one time is enough.	saingy ampy ny fotoana iray izay
They will do well.	hanao tsara izy ireo
But he is much more than that.	saingy mihoatra lavitra noho izany izy
But that never happened.	tsy nisy mihitsy anefa izany
But that is no longer the case.	tsy izany intsony anefa
I have a problem with both.	manana olana aminizy roa aho
So it is with all wars.	toy izany koa ny ady rehetra
At other times he was not so good.	taminny fotoana hafa dia tsy dia tsara loatra izy
Even that option is better.	na izany safidy izany aza dia tsara kokoa
Well then the problem.	eny ary ny olana
It becomes a little difficult.	lasa sarotra kely izany
It’s not that important, though.	tsy hoe zavadehibe izany na izany aza
Look around.	jereo ny manodidina
It’s always been that way.	dia toy izany foana
The story was meaningless.	tsy nisy dikany ny tantara
I will definitely do more with that.	azo antoka fa hanao bebe kokoa aminizany aho
I expect better results.	manantena vokatra tsara kokoa aho
I still think that's true.	mbola heveriko fa marina izany
We are the reality without words.	isika no tena zavamisy tsy misy teny
That's where they are.	ao no misy azy ireo
I really like this product.	tena tiako ity vokatra ity
I will not be lost.	tsy ho very aho
Not like men.	tsy toy ny lehilahy
We really enjoy the next one.	tena mahafinaritra antsika ny manaraka
Of course, they don’t have a high position.	mazava ho azy fa tsy manana toerana ambony izy ireo
It’s really fun now.	tena mahafinaritra tokoa izy io ankehitriny
Reason is choice.	ny antony dia safidy
It doesn’t seem good at all.	toa tsy tsara mihitsy izany
He’s kind of a man to me.	karazana lehilahy amiko izy
Nothing went well.	tsy nisy nandeha tsara
He can have people.	afaka manana olona izy
Maybe he would do something for her.	angamba hanao zavatra ho azy izy
They did, a lot.	nanao izy ireo be dia be
He had no private life.	tsy nanana fiainana manokana izy
I'm busy right now.	be atao aho izao
He didn't say anything to her.	tsy nilaza na inona na inona taminy
Far more important.	zavadehibe lavitra
It doesn’t make sense to me either.	tsy misy dikany amiko koa
This is a difficult question.	fanontaniana sarotra izany
I can't.	tsy afaka
They stopped at one thing.	nijanona zavatra iray izy ireo
Yes, that is not true.	eny tsy marina izany
It said something to me.	nilaza zavatra tamiko izany
Just like a man.	toy ny lehilahy ihany
In fact, sometimes it is very difficult.	raha ny marina indraindray dia sarotra be izany
I really see these things.	hitako tokoa ireo zavatra ireo
And we can’t have a job.	ary tsy afaka manana asa izahay
He really doesn’t deserve it.	tena tsy mendrika izany izy
Maybe you don’t know that there is such a problem.	angamba tsy fantatrao fa misy olana toy izany
They still have it.	mbola manana izany izy ireo
I really like this event.	tena tiako ity hetsika ity
This is a stupid man.	lehilahy adala io
Nothing special, just people.	tsy misy zavatra manokana olona fotsiny
Work, work.	asa asa
They looked at us, and they knew it.	nijery antsika izy ireo ka fantany izany
I could have other problems, for sure.	afaka mahazo olana hafa aho azo antoka
Not as simple as it seems.	tsy tsotra araka ny hita
It doesn't fit well.	tsy mety tsara izany
So you get the idea.	ka azonao ny hevitra
But in the end, you do something about it.	aminny farany anefa dia manao zavatra momba izany ianao
Of course, a little fun.	mazava ho azy fa kely mahafinaritra
We are not so sure.	tsy dia azo antoka loatra isika
Here we have none.	eto isika dia tsy manana
But we have a bigger problem.	saingy manana olana lehibe kokoa isika
However you are wrong to look at it.	na izany aza dia diso ianao mijery izany
Got a job.	nahazo asa
It all seems so simple.	toa tsotra be daholo izany
But this one is different.	hafa mihitsy anefa ity iray ity
Work will do it for you.	ny asa dia hanao izany aminao
I’ve never had any other kind of job.	mbola tsy nanana karazana asa hafa mihitsy aho
No one was found.	tsy nisy olona hita
It’s fun.	mahafinaritra ilay izy
They both had money.	samy nanana vola izy ireo
Some are just a lot of work.	ny sasany dia asa be fotsiny
Enough pictures.	ampy izay ny sary
It was a good year !.	taona tsara izany
This is old news.	vaovao taloha izany
And for me too.	ary ho ahy koa
It’s always the first step, and it’s essential.	ny dingana voalohany foana ary tena ilaina
If anything, it’s even worse.	raha misy dia ratsy kokoa izany
But, it’s definitely a bad approach.	saingy azo antoka fa fomba ratsy izany
And you said yes.	ary hoy ianao hoe eny
But the problem is trivial.	saingy ny olana dia tsy misy dikany
This is because they are so new.	izany dia satria vaovao be izy ireo
I need someone here.	mila olona eto aho
We will do the same.	hanao toy izany koa isika
But that is the reality.	izany anefa no tena zavamisy
Each day is very similar at the end.	ny andro tsirairay dia tena mitovy aminny farany
However, this does not seem to be the case.	na izany aza toa tsy izany no zavamisy
This is the first.	izany no voalohany
There is nothing worse than this one.	tsy misy zavatra ratsy kokoa noho ity iray ity
Good people.	olona tsara
I am always busy.	be atao foana aho
I think that's okay.	heveriko fa mety izany
He doesn't need it.	tsy mila izany izy
It’s all been a long time coming.	efa ela be izany rehetra izany
Things are simple.	tsotra ny zavatra
They are great.	lehibe izy ireo
He did not want to be loved, but loved.	tsy te ho tia azy izy fa tia azy
We all did the same.	nanao toy izany koa izahay rehetra
The money also did not seem to exist.	toa tsy tena nisy koa ilay vola
That was the end for me.	izay no farany ho ahy
I couldn’t have had it.	tsy afaka nanana izany aho
But this is not necessary.	tsy ilaina anefa izany
I will come to you.	ho avy aminao aho
I want him for me.	tiako ho ahy izy
Maybe you do too.	angamba ianao manao izany koa
But that is not the only reason.	saingy tsy izany ihany no antony
I follow him more than he does.	manaraka azy bebe kokoa noho izy aho
And it was done, it went.	ary tanteraka izany nandeha
This is also clear.	mazava koa izany
The choice is clear.	mazava tsara ny safidy
You can already see it there.	efa azonao teo ny mahita azy
Have, have.	manana manana
This is both a good and a bad thing.	izany dia zavatra tsara sy ratsy
two nights ago.	alina roa lasa izay
Need to get there first.	mila tonga any aloha
He found a good job.	nahita asa tsara izy
Only one man.	lehilahy iray ihany
People here love you.	tia anao ny olona eto
But make it loud and clear.	fa ataovy mafy sy mazava
And there is no particular reason for that.	ary tsy misy antony manokana aminizany
All of this was done clearly and simply.	natao mazava sy tsotra daholo izany rehetra izany
It was really fun to get something custom made.	nahafinaritra tokoa ny nahazo zavatra natao manokana
Life was not so much fun.	tsy dia nahafinaritra loatra ny fiainana
It's all there.	hita daholo
You just had to go.	tsy maintsy nandeha fotsiny ianao
He could do whatever he wanted.	afaka nanao izay tiany izy
And although not for everyone.	ary na dia tsy ny rehetra aza
I know there are many others like me.	fantatro fa misy maro hafa toa ahy
It might still be best for me.	mety mbola ho tsara indrindra ho ahy izany
Nor is it suitable for everyone.	tsy izany koa no mety ho anny rehetra
They are not easy.	tsy mora izy ireo
But, because of that, it’s really fun.	saingy noho izany tena mahafinaritra
This fact does not seem to be enough.	toa tsy ampy anefa izany zavamisy izany
Maybe he will still do it.	angamba mbola hanao izany izy
He will not be the last either.	tsy ho farany koa izy
Not one or the other, but both.	tsy ny iray na ny iray fa izy roa
The world is too hard for that.	mafy loatra izao tontolo izao noho izany
He has to do it sometimes.	tokony hanao izany izy indraindray
But if so, so be it.	fa raha izany no izy dia ho izany
They must be stupid too.	tsy maintsy adala koa izy ireo
If he did, he would have told her.	raha nanao izany izy dia ho nilaza taminy
It was too much once.	efa be loatra izany indray mandeha
Of course, this is too big for one person.	mazava ho azy fa lehibe loatra ho anny olona iray izany
In the past, now.	tany taloha izao
He’s a man, he’s a woman.	lehilahy izy vehivavy izy
It is also very safe.	tena azo antoka koa ilay izy
It's new.	vaovao ilay izy
However, the wording is unclear.	na izany aza ny teny dia tsy mazava
There are two problems here.	misy olana roa eto
But he must do something else.	tokony hanao zavatra hafa koa anefa izy
This woman looks crazy.	hita fa adala ity vehivavy ity
Sometimes that life doesn’t seem real anymore.	indraindray dia toa tsy tena misy intsony izany fiainana izany
I like it right away.	tiako avy hatrany
It was just a normal day.	andro mahazatra fotsiny izany
A man is happy when he has everything.	faly ny lehilahy iray raha manana ny zavadrehetra izy
I can't find a way.	tsy mahita lalana aho
First, they are not the first.	voalohany dia tsy izy ireo no voalohany
Some, of course, are far from simple.	ny sasany tokoa dia lavitra ny tsotra
I might do it again this year.	mety hanao izany indray aho aminity taona ity
The latter is also wrong.	ity farany ihany koa no diso
But there was no safe place when the war began.	tsy nisy toerana azo antoka anefa rehefa nanomboka ny ady
And in general, it makes sense.	ary aminny ankapobeny dia misy dikany izany
You may not understand that.	mety tsy azonao izany
Not the world.	tsy ny tontolo
Check it out today.	jereo izy anio
At that time there was.	taminizany fotoana izany dia nisy
These are the only two options you have.	ireo ihany no safidy roa azonao
But it came.	saingy tonga izany
However, in fact.	na izany aza raha ny marina
It didn’t exist and he knew it.	tsy nisy izany ary fantany izany
They love them.	tia azy ireo izy ireo
I need to do better at that.	mila manao tsara kokoa aminizany aho
I hope you get it.	manantena aho fa ho azonao izany
Like two years ago.	toy ny roa taona lasa izay
I'm in the wrong place.	diso toerana ny ahy
Because one can get them.	satria afaka mahazo azy ireo ny olona iray
We do it by car.	manao izany aminny fiara izahay
Not too fast often.	tsy dia haingana loatra matetika
He looked at the ground.	nijery ny tany
That's just fine.	tsara fotsiny izany
You could be yours.	mety ho anao ianao
And then the food.	ary avy eo ny sakafo
I know what is to come.	fantatro izay ho avy
They are not here.	tsy eto izy ireo
But it doesn’t seem to exist anymore.	saingy toa tsy misy intsony izany
Time, for once, will come here.	ny fotoana indray mandeha dia ho tonga eto
I need action.	mila hetsika aho
He saw nothing inside.	tsy nahita na inona na inona tao anatiny izy
I don’t expect anyone to go there.	tsy manantena aho fa hisy olona ho any
They are not ours.	tsy lasa antsika izy ireo
Lots of nice people.	be dia be ny olona mahafinaritra
He just doesn’t know.	tsy fantany fotsiny
We go as long as we can.	mandeha isika raha mbola azo atao
However, he will still be here.	na izany aza mbola ho eto izy
Sometimes they don’t know what the real story is.	indraindray dia tsy fantany izay tena tantara
But the woman.	fa ilay vehivavy
Day and day.	andro sy andro
He was there when they left.	teo izy rehefa lasa izy ireo
But recently.	fa vao haingana
But that's it, and he knows it.	fa izany no izy ary fantany izany
I know that’s good.	fantatro fa tsara izany
A man can go crazy.	mety ho lasa adala ny lehilahy iray
We are one step closer.	dingana iray isika
Everything is working fine now.	miasa tsara izao ny zavadrehetra
Couldn't say why.	tsy afaka nilaza ny antony
And then he left.	ary avy eo dia lasa izy
It was a little fun.	nahafinaritra kely ilay izy
Typically, this is true.	raha ny mahazatra dia marina izany
I had no idea.	tsy nanana hevitra aho
But you are wrong.	diso hevitra anefa ianao
He is always far away.	lavitra foana izy
At night.	na alina
I was completely lost.	very tanteraka aho
But that is old.	efa taloha anefa izany
You should have seen me before.	tokony efa nahita ahy ianao taloha
Enough for both of us.	ampy ho antsika roa
But that is all that is needed.	fa izay ihany no ilaina
It’s one reason, no other.	antony iray izany tsy misy hafa
Money seems immortal.	toa tsy mety maty ny vola
I really didn’t get there.	tena tsy tonga tany aho
If you don’t, there may be a problem.	raha tsy izany ianao dia mety hisy olana
This is bad.	izao no ratsy
But this story is not true.	tsy marina anefa izany tantara izany
That’s probably the problem.	izany angamba no olana
It can work if it wants to.	afaka miasa raha tiany izany
He is not good.	tsy tsara izy
Never do anything else.	tsy manao zavatra hafa mihitsy
Everyone came to watch.	tonga nijery ny rehetra
Then came the picture.	dia tonga ny sary
You have to be like that.	tsy maintsy ho toy izany ianao
All the food is gone.	lasa daholo ny sakafo
It was as if I didn’t even know.	toy ny hoe tsy fantany akory aho
A lot is lost in this process.	betsaka ny zavatra very aminity dingana ity
There is no end here.	tsy misy farany eto
Just go fast.	mandeha haingana fotsiny
And then, just like that, he left.	ary avy eo toy izany ihany dia lasa izy
But there is a reason.	misy antony anefa
If they don’t, you can do other things.	raha tsy izy ireo dia afaka manao zavatra hafa ianao
But you know that he loves you more than anything else.	fantatrao anefa fa tia anao mihoatra noho ny zavatra rehetra izy
It’s not too far away, actually.	tsy dia lavitra loatra izany raha ny marina
They didn’t tell me.	tsy nilaza tamiko izy ireo
And by all means, everyone should.	ary aminny fomba rehetra ny tsirairay dia tokony
Such a thing could very well be true.	mety ho marina tokoa ny zavatra toy izany
You are wrong.	diso hevitra ianao
This is the fun part.	ity no ampahany nahafinaritra
They shouldn’t be.	tsy tokony ho izy ireo
Not that word.	tsy io teny io
She couldn’t be happier.	tsy afaka ny ho faly kokoa izy
As for the latter, there never was.	raha ny momba ity farany dia tsy nisy mihitsy
You were there.	teo ianao
The conversation went well.	nandeha tsara ny resaka
In fact, it’s harder than that.	raha ny marina dia sarotra kokoa noho izany
Best for the latter.	ny tsara indrindra ho anny farany
It was only in him, that was all.	tao aminy ihany izany izay ihany
I start again.	manomboka indray aho
just us.	izahay ihany
It's not yours.	tsy anao izany
They are not the same as where they are.	tsy mitovy aminny toerana misy azy izy ireo
They went well.	nandeha tsara izy ireo
There will always be work.	hisy foana ny asa
And that's it.	dia izay no izy
It still seems like a good idea.	toa mbola hevitra tsara ihany ilay izy
Do what you want.	ataovy izay tianao
Maybe you don’t need it right away.	angamba tsy mila izany avy hatrany ianao
It didn't go well at first.	tsy nandeha tsara izany taminny voalohany
He was everything to me.	izy no zavadrehetra tamiko
I thank him again.	misaotra azy indray aho
But that is a good idea.	hevitra tsara anefa izany
I think that has to be true.	heveriko fa tsy maintsy ho marina izany
From now on it is theirs.	nanomboka izao dia azy ireo
One day, like.	aminny andro iray toy ny
For some reason it is less than it should be.	noho ny antony sasany dia kely noho ny tokony ho izy
It's been a long time.	efa ela be izao
I have no problem with that whatsoever.	tsy manana olana aminizany aho na inona na inona
A special place for him.	toerana manokana ho azy
I always thank you.	misaotra anao hatrany aho
And either you, and they don’t.	ary na ianao ary tsy izy ireo
There is nothing in it.	tsy misy na inona na inona ao
It was so much fun.	tena mahafinaritra be ilay izy
But there is no one way in it alone.	saingy tsy misy fomba iray ao aminy irery
It really meant a lot to me.	tena nisy dikany tamiko izany
To me, it seems special.	amiko dia toa manokana izany
It’s hard for me to watch him sometimes.	sarotra amiko ny mijery azy indraindray
And, of course, it’s not much the same.	ary mazava ho azy tsy mitovy be izany
I don’t see what’s important.	tsy hitako ny zavadehibe
That is the real reason.	izany no tena antony
I did the same thing in the first place.	nanao izany koa aho taminny voalohany
You didn’t think so.	tsy nieritreritra ianao
It was nice to see you.	nahafinaritra ny nahita anao
This also seems wrong.	toa diso koa izany
This person has the same problem as you.	manana olana mitovy aminao io olona io
They are the same man.	izy ireo dia lehilahy iray ihany
They will be missing !.	ho tsy hita izy ireo
He is coming soon.	efa ho avy izy
It is no longer the case.	tsy izany intsony no izy
Surely this is the only one who really loves him.	azo antoka fa io ihany no tena tia azy
Just the words.	ny teny ihany
If he loves you, he will.	raha tia anao izy dia hanao izany
Little did he know that this was the last time.	tsy fantany fa io no fotoana farany
I’ve done that before.	efa nanao izany aho taloha
You can’t expect results, of course, right away.	tsy afaka manantena vokatra ianao mazava ho azy avy hatrany
He just left one day.	vao lasa izy indray andro
It can’t be good.	tsy mety ho tsara izany
Now we have to get it.	ankehitriny dia tsy maintsy mahazo izany isika
Well you said that to me.	eny ary ianao no nilaza izany ho ahy
There is not too much in it.	tsy misy zavatra be loatra ao
And finally.	ary aminny farany
As fun as it can be.	mahafinaritra araka izay azo atao
He did something.	nanao zavatra izy
There is good reason for that.	misy antony tsara izany
We finally had a place for ourselves.	nanana toerana ho anay izahay taminny farany
We don’t look at the pictures very much.	tsy dia mijery ny sary izahay
But it all went away.	lasa daholo anefa izany

There are one, two, and three stories.	misy tantara iray roa ary telo
Now there is none.	ankehitriny tsy misy
That's exactly it.	izay mihitsy
I still have it now.	mbola manana izany aho ankehitriny

You don’t need a problem like this.	tsy mila olana toy izao ianao

They have their own.	manana ny tenany izy ireo
This idea is irrelevant again.	ity hevitra ity dia tsy misy dikany indray
But for now, don’t do anything like that.	fa aminizao fotoana izao tsy manao zavatra toy izany
And we were confused.	ary very hevitra izahay
I think he likes them.	heveriko fa tiany izy ireo

We are from the future.	avy aminny ho avy isika
You don’t need to.	tsy mila ianao
At first, this process seems familiar.	aminny voalohany ity dingana ity dia toa mahazatra
It is better to start.	dia tsara kokoa ny manomboka
I saw that they were real people.	hitako fa olona tena izy ireo
And it works.	ary miasa izany
It is not a matter of money.	tsy resaka vola akory izany
He thought well.	nieritreritra tsara izy
It’s too big and too big for me.	tena lehibe izy io ary lehibe loatra amiko
It’s not hard either.	tsy sarotra koa izany

I don't see the problem.	tsy hitako ny olana
All three little words.	teny kely telo daholo
The game is full of stories.	ny lalao dia feno tantara
If so, he may still be there.	raha izany no izy dia mety mbola ao ihany izy
Then he looked around.	dia nijery ny manodidina izy
They are wrong.	diso lalana izy ireo
It's very simple.	tena tsotra tokoa izany
They don’t need it much.	tsy mila izany loatra izy ireo
None of them are good.	tsy misy tsara aminizy ireo
Apparently the story still exists.	hita fa mbola misy ny tantara
Because, of course, he will be alone.	satria mazava ho azy ho irery izy
He will work before he comes here.	hanao asa izy vao ho avy eto
However, it was almost pointless to see anything.	na izany aza saika tsy nisy dikany ny nahita na inona na inona
I deserve more than that.	mendrika mihoatra noho izany aho
There are two major problems.	misy olana roa lehibe
He would never have gone to such a place.	tsy ho nandeha tany aminny toerana toy izany mihitsy izy

But we never get more than that.	saingy tsy mahazo mihoatra noho izany mihitsy isika
Wrong or right.	diso na mety
You need to know this first.	tokony ho fantatrao aloha izany

In fact, you will be wrong.	raha ny marina dia ho diso ianao
And that is real life.	ary tena fiainana tokoa izany
Usually this is not a problem.	raha ny mahazatra dia tsy olana izany
These words will be difficult for you.	ho sarotra aminao ireo teny ireo
One in particular.	iray manokana
Not everyone, but many do.	tsy ny rehetra fa maro no manao izany
It was nice to see him again.	nahafinaritra ny nahita azy indray
You are the beautiful woman.	ianao ilay vehivavy tsara tarehy
So it’s all new from here on out.	ka dia vaovao daholo izany manomboka eto
It didn’t make sense to me.	tsy nisy dikany tamiko
Although everything seems to be true.	na dia toa marina aza ny zavadrehetra
They are nothing.	tsy inona izy ireo
But nothing else could be done.	tsy nisy zavatra hafa azo natao anefa
But it was a different life for me.	fiainana hafa anefa izany ho ahy
I started with nothing.	nanomboka tsy nisy na inona na inona aho
It seems so simple, but it’s always misleading.	toa tsotra be ilay izy saingy diso hevitra hatrany
It could be all of us soon.	mety ho antsika rehetra tsy ho ela
That's enough, they said.	ampy izay hoy izy ireo
But you have others.	fa manana hafa ianao
It seems to be about that.	toa ny momba izany
No one is happy, but no one can do anything about it.	tsy misy olona faly fa tsy misy afaka manao na inona na inona momba izany
I think he will.	heveriko fa hanao izany izy
He never had a word.	tsy nanana teny mihitsy izy
I should be very happy.	tokony ho faly be aho
He knows where he is.	fantany ny misy azy
But these things may not be important to you.	mety tsy ho zavadehibe aminao anefa ireo zavatra ireo
I know it’s not easy.	fantatro fa tsy mora izany
It really means something to me.	tena misy dikany amiko izany
Both things are the same.	samy zavatra mitovy
A woman did not see the man.	vehivavy iray no tsy nahita ilay lehilahy
It’s hard to watch.	sarotra ny mijery
It really doesn’t matter.	tena tsy dia zavadehibe izany
I didn’t see anything else at first.	tsy nahita zavatra hafa aho taminny voalohany

But that is not an easy task.	tsy fomba mora anefa izany
You know women are women.	fantatrao fa vehivavy ny vehivavy
It’s like it’s starting all over again.	toy ny hoe manomboka indray izany

We can do that here.	afaka manao izany isika eto
I know what kind of it.	fantatro ny karazana azy
Going very fast.	mandeha haingana be

There is nothing unpleasant.	tsy misy zavatra tsy mahafinaritra
There seems to be a good reason.	toa misy antony tsara
They are so beautiful.	tena tsara tarehy izy ireo

I could see it clearly.	hitako mazava tsara ilay izy
He is now dead.	efa maty izy izao
It doesn’t make much sense to do that.	tsy dia misy dikany loatra ny manao izany
They are not very fast.	tsy dia haingana loatra izy ireo
At three.	aminny telo
But don't expect us.	fa aza manantena anay

They are gone for the most part.	lasa izy ireo aminny ankapobeny
They said they weren’t.	nilaza izy ireo fa tsy izy ireo
Maybe there was nothing in it.	angamba tsy nisy na inona na inona tao anatiny
It’s really important.	tena zavadehibe tokoa
And the people said something to him.	ary ny olona nilaza zavatra taminy
Only one will do it.	iray ihany no hanao izany
Someone went.	nisy olona nandeha
And they will do it again, maybe soon.	ary mbola hanao izany indray izy ireo angamba tsy ho ela
It's not you.	tsy ianao io
And, in fact, it is.	ary raha ny marina dia izany
I was not stupid then.	tsy adala aho taminizany
He probably would never do that.	tsy hanao izany mihitsy angamba izy
It seems easy, but the lifestyle comes to you.	toa mora izany fa ny fomba fiainana dia tonga aminao
I said, yes, of course.	hoy aho hoe eny mazava ho azy
It seems true.	toa marina
These two things are not the same.	tsy mitovy ireo zavatra roa ireo
See the next question.	jereo ny fanontaniana manaraka
Almost always the ground.	saika foana ny tany
But the time has not come.	saingy tsy tonga ny fotoana
You need to have a home.	mila manana trano
This is the easy part.	ity no ampahany mora
This also seems very true.	toa tena marina koa izany
Of course, they did not tell him.	mazava ho azy fa tsy nilaza taminy izy ireo
I have the best.	manana ny tsara indrindra aho
This is a very clear idea.	hevitra mazava be io
It is always there for them.	eo foana ho azy ireo izany
They are almost two different things.	saika roa samy hafa izy ireo

I know a lot of women very well.	fantatro tsara ny vehivavy maro
For one, he didn’t have anyone he loved.	ny iray tsy nanana olona tiany izy
And in fact, no problem.	ary raha ny marina dia tsy misy olana
But that is not the only problem.	tsy io ihany anefa no olana
So, it has to be.	noho izany dia tsy maintsy ho io
I work for you.	asa ho anao aho
That is enough for all of us.	ampy izay ho antsika rehetra
Since then, there has been none.	nanomboka teo dia tsy nisy
There is a universe.	misy izao rehetra izao
There is nothing special about it.	tsy misy zavatra manokana momba izany
The only problem is it’s not true.	ny olana fotsiny dia tsy marina izany
They are a real problem.	tena olana tena izy ireo
But the woman lost nothing.	tsy very na inona na inona anefa io vehivavy io
I have never seen anyone like him.	tsy mbola nahita olona toa azy aho
They are really bad.	tena ratsy izy ireo
We always had to go.	tsy maintsy nandeha foana izahay
It must be wrong.	tsy maintsy diso
The problem is, it’s not enough.	ny olana dia tsy ampy izany

The old things are bad.	ratsy ny zavatra taloha
It would be good there.	mety tsara any
They really had it.	tena nanana izany izy ireo
Something has to happen.	misy zavatra tsy maintsy misy
That’s the way he likes it.	izany no fomba tiany
Of course, the problem is not immediate.	mazava ho azy fa tsy eo no ho eo ny olana
Yes, this is an old move.	eny hetsika taloha izany
The job is lost.	ny asa dia very azy
Immediately on the face.	avy hatrany eo aminny tarehy
But at the time, it seemed important.	saingy taminizany fotoana izany dia toa zavadehibe izany
While you’re there, look around.	raha mbola any ianao dia jereo ny manodidina
Thank you so much for that.	misaotra anao indrindra aho noho izany
It has always been his.	efa azy foana izany
He did not know where he was.	tsy fantany ny misy azy
I know exactly what it is.	fantatro tsara hoe inona izany
We all started.	nanomboka izahay rehetra
And maybe more than once.	ary mety mihoatra ny indray mandeha
But good.	fa tsara
I had no reason whatsoever.	tsy nanana antony na inona na inona aho
I have never seen anyone like him.	mbola tsy nahita olona toa azy koa aho
You really can.	tena azonao atao
But it doesn’t really work.	tsy tena miasa anefa izany
However, with men.	na izany aza miaraka aminny lehilahy
But it’s not here or there.	saingy tsy eto na any izany
But there is one last problem.	misy olana iray farany anefa
This is not a good way.	tsy fomba tsara izany
Yes, it really is.	eny tena izy
And in general this is true.	ary aminny ankapobeny dia marina izany
Not if the person is completely full.	tsy izany raha tena feno tanteraka ilay olona
Then the conversation went bad.	dia lasa ratsy ny resaka
But we had no choice.	tsy nanana safidy anefa izahay
Some of them are not very clear.	tsy dia mazava loatra ny sasany aminizy ireo
Too much stuff.	be loatra ny zavatra
Which, of course, is also true.	izay tena marina ihany koa
And there is nothing wrong with that.	ary tsy misy ratsy izany
I have thought about everything carefully.	efa nieritreritra tsara ny zavadrehetra aho
But there was no car.	tsy nisy fiara anefa
I’m not happy to say even a little.	tsy faly aho nilaza na dia kely aza
Couldn't find a word.	tsy nahita teny
He needed to say that.	nila nilaza izany izy
For them.	ho azy ireo
Not everyone can work here.	tsy ny rehetra no afaka miasa eto
Or as accurate as possible.	na marina araka izay azo atao
Then this is the end for you.	dia izao no farany ho anao
But it is still a long way off.	saingy mbola lavitra izany
And these are very important.	ary tena ilaina tokoa ireo
You love them both.	tianao izy roa
They have to see me.	tsy maintsy mahita ahy izy ireo
We needed more.	nila bebe kokoa izahay
Really stupid, not fun.	tena adala tsy mahafinaritra
And that's it.	ary izay ihany
The word no longer has any meaning.	tsy misy dikany intsony io teny io
Now he needed more time.	izao izy vao nila fotoana bebe kokoa
The reason is mine.	ahy ny antony
Not so now.	tsy izany izao
At one point that was enough.	taminny fotoana iray dia ampy izany
He is still too young.	mbola kely loatra izy
Maybe they expect it.	angamba manantena azy izy ireo
Nothing, in terms of money.	tsy misy na inona na inona aminny resaka vola
And there’s a lot about both of them.	ary be dia be ny momba azy roa ireo
Take a good look at the object.	jereo tsara ilay zavatra
But it could be the same.	saingy mety ho toy izany ihany koa
You know him far better than we do.	fantatrao lavitra noho isika izy
There are some really good ones.	misy ny sasany tena tsara
I think that’s crazy.	heveriko fa adala izany
Not that good.	tsy ny tsara
You, or someone like you.	ianao na olona toa anao
And rightly or wrongly, he needed it.	ary na mety na tsy mety dia nila azy izy
They don’t seem to be there.	toa tsy ao izy ireo
The night is ours.	ny alina dia anay
She watched him die.	nijery azy maty izy
There’s really no possibility.	tsy tena misy ny mety
But they are both alone.	saingy samy irery izy ireo
However, you can too.	na izany aza azonao atao koa
It wasn’t too fun either.	tsy dia nahafinaritra koa izany
There are a variety of things you can do.	misy karazana zavatra azonao atao
The food and all too.	ny sakafo sy ny rehetra koa
He would have been better off without them.	tsara kokoa izy raha tsy nisy azy ireo
You just have to be in person right now.	tokony ho eo aminny olona fotsiny ianao aminizao fotoana izao
It was fun there.	nahafinaritra tao
He might have done it.	mety ho nanao izany izy
I have never done anything like this before.	mbola tsy nanao zavatra toy izao koa aho
It’s not an easy job, for sure.	tsy asa mora izany azo antoka
There’s a lot going on here.	be dia be ny eto
This is a special one for me.	ity dia iray manokana ho ahy
It all works well.	izany rehetra izany dia miasa tsara
He also seems to be a nice person.	toa olona mahafinaritra koa izy
Thank you again.	misaotra anao indray
But they did come.	saingy tonga ihany izy ireo
It’s a no -brainer.	izy io dia tsy misy antoka na inona na inona
The same goes for work.	toy izany koa ny asa
I may be wrong about the fact so the question is.	mety diso ny zavamisy aho noho izany ny fanontaniana
But with that, there is no question whatsoever.	saingy aminizany dia tsy misy fanontaniana na inona na inona
I had to watch it.	tsy maintsy nijery izany aho
Nothing hard to get.	tsy nisy mafy azo
Time is time.	fotoana ny fotoana
Everything is very good.	tena tsara ny rehetra
The woman said that.	nilaza izany teny izany ilay vehivavy
Which is good.	izay tsara
Yes, you are a real woman, like her.	eny tena vehivavy ianao toa azy
It's hard to do.	mafy ny atao
It’s very different.	tena hafa izany
If you do nothing.	raha tsy manao na inona na inona
More about us here.	bebe kokoa momba anay eto
That’s it, but it’s much more than that.	izany no izy fa mihoatra lavitra noho izany
With now.	miaraka izao
It's just not right.	tsy mety mihitsy izany
It is also full.	feno koa izany
He knows it well.	fantany tsara
He doesn't look at me anymore.	tsy mijery ahy intsony
Please check this out.	mba jereo ity
This is often necessary.	izany matetika no ilaina
The night is dead.	efa maty ny alina
But this work is a little different.	hafa kely anefa ity asa ity
Love it.	tia azy io
If you did, you told him the truth.	raha nanao izany ianao dia nilaza taminy ny marina
He is one of the same species.	iray aminireo karazana ireo ihany izy
But overall, it could have been worse.	saingy aminny ankapobeny mety ho ratsy kokoa izany
I've seen him before.	efa nahita azy aho taloha
He also knows the way.	fantany koa ny lalana
They are close.	izy ireo no akaiky
But I have an idea.	manana hevitra iray anefa aho
But now it’s gone, like that.	fa izao dia lasa toy izany
He needed to think of something.	nila nieritreritra zavatra izy
Maybe so too.	mety ho izy koa angamba
And it’s actually about that.	ary raha ny marina dia momba izany
Not like before.	tsy toy ny teo aloha
They need to keep up with the times.	mila manaraka ny fotoana izy ireo
This is a difficult time for us.	fotoana sarotra ho antsika izao
Any kind of thing like that.	na inona na inona karazana zavatra toy izany
I came here to.	tonga eto aho mba
It will all be easy.	ho mora izany rehetra izany
He really had it for me.	tena nanana izany tamiko izy
They are fun too.	mahafinaritra ihany koa izy ireo
Doing hard work.	manao asa sarotra
And there was, and now.	ary nisy ary izao
Of course, not at the same time.	mazava ho azy fa tsy aminny fotoana iray ihany
I never saw it.	tsy hitako mihitsy ilay izy
He knew this was not the right place for him.	fantany fa tsy ity no toerana mety aminy
But without that meaning, lives are lost.	saingy raha tsy misy izany dikany izany dia very ny fiainana
The big one? 	ilay lehibe
Always looked at him.	nijery azy foana
You just need it.	mila izany fotsiny ianao
He knows the game too.	fantany ny lalao koa
He loved it all.	tiany izany rehetra izany
You weren't there for long.	tsy teo ela ianao
I can be happy.	afaka ny ho faly aho
He simply has to do it.	tsy maintsy manao izany tsotra izao izy
It will not be safe.	tsy ho azo antoka izany
Of course, this is unusual, and unusual.	mazava ho azy fa tsy mahazatra izany ary tsy mahazatra
In fact, we wouldn’t do that.	raha ny marina dia tsy hanao izany izahay
Because they did.	satria nanao izany izy ireo
I think he liked the idea.	heveriko fa tiany ilay hevitra
And have good stuff.	ary manana zavatra tsara
And, you know, they are better than us.	ary fantatrao tsara kokoa noho isika izy ireo
We deserve more.	mendrika bebe kokoa izahay
Then the real fun begins.	dia manomboka ny tena mahafinaritra
So there may not be any more.	ka mety tsy hisy intsony
Not just kind of stupid.	tsy karazana adala fotsiny
To me, everything is as clear as day.	amiko dia mazava toy ny andro ny zavadrehetra
And so he went.	dia nandeha ihany izy
But it is not necessary but you can.	tsy ilaina anefa izany fa azonao atao
I didn’t have anything else right.	tsy nanana zavatra hafa mety aho
The context is very important.	tena zavadehibe tokoa ny teny manodidina
Stupid, just stupid.	adala adala tsotra izao
Of course he was right.	mazava ho azy fa marina ny azy
They don’t have the facts.	tsy manana ny zavamisy izy ireo
We will not do that.	tsy hanao izany izahay
No one has a problem with that.	tsy misy manana olana aminizany
This, however, is only the first step.	izany anefa dia dingana voalohany fotsiny
Sometimes he was almost himself old.	indraindray izy dia saika ny tenany taloha
Although it looks beautiful.	na dia toa tsara tarehy aza izany
I had them all.	nanana azy rehetra aho
Not the most obvious choice.	tsy ny safidy mazava indrindra
He is better than before.	tsara kokoa noho ny taloha izy
It’s almost going to be really bad.	saika ho tena ratsy be izany
But I was wrong.	fa diso ny ahy
So look around.	koa jereo ny manodidina
This one went faster.	lasa haingana kokoa ity iray ity
It seemed so hard to find him in the past.	toa sarotra be ny nahita azy taloha
Already a lot.	efa betsaka
This is the hardest part.	ity no ampahany sarotra indrindra
It’s a bigger place.	toerana lehibe kokoa io
Both did.	samy nanao izany
Because that’s what works for me.	satria io no mety amiko
There should be only three.	tokony ho telo ihany
Look at you now.	jereo izao ianao
To me, he’s fast.	amiko haingana izy
We enjoyed all the activities.	nahafinaritra anay ny hetsika rehetra
It really does exist.	tena misy tokoa
I haven't seen anything yet.	tsy mbola nahita na inona na inona aho
But that can be a mistake.	mety ho diso hevitra anefa izany
They just go two different paths.	mandeha lalana roa samy hafa fotsiny izy ireo
We are very happy for him.	tena faly izahay ho azy
But still not good enough.	saingy mbola tsy ampy tsara
Sometimes that is the reality.	indraindray izany no tena zavamisy
They are crazy.	adala ireo
But to me it was completely different.	fa amiko dia hafa tanteraka ilay izy
Words, words, words.	teny teny teny
Far from it, in fact.	lavitra azy io raha ny marina
It looks beautiful.	toa tsara tarehy
The fact is you need me.	ny zavamisy dia mila ahy ianao
You are the only one for me.	ianao irery no ho ahy
He became something else.	lasa zavatra hafa izy
Not so, of course.	tsy toy izany mazava ho azy
Everything is full.	feno daholo ny zavadrehetra
More to come soon.	mbola manaraka tsy ho ela
At the right time.	aminny fotoana tsara
But they went fast.	nandeha haingana anefa izy ireo
It doesn’t make sense right now.	tsy misy dikany izany aminizao fotoana izao
That is not the case here.	tsy izany no zavamisy eto
No, he can't.	tsia tsy afaka izy
It can be too hard.	mety ho mafy loatra izany
You know exactly what it is.	fantatrao tsara hoe inona izany
Everyone is different.	samy hafa ny tsirairay
All is well then.	tsara daholo avy eo
This is no longer possible.	tsy azo atao intsony izany
That is still not enough.	mbola tsy ampy izany
This is very new.	tena vaovao izany
In years to come, nothing is certain.	aminny taona ho avy tsy misy azo antoka
Then you come.	dia tonga ianao
So we have a lot of things.	noho izany dia manana zavatra be dia be tokoa isika
The least for me.	ny kely indrindra amiko
They are all beautiful.	tsara tarehy izy rehetra
People everywhere are crazy.	adala ny olona eny rehetra eny
We both needed it.	samy nila izany izahay
And then comes the hard part.	ary avy eo dia tonga ny ampahany sarotra
He was glad to see it.	faly izy fa nahita izany
We need a little more.	mila kely kokoa isika
I love this picture.	tiako ity sary ity
Which is something very different.	izay zavatra tena hafa
I know these little paths.	fantatro ireo lalana kely ireo
He really didn’t do anything now.	tena tsy nanao na inona na inona izy izao
It might even be a decent story.	mety ho tantara mendrika mihitsy aza
We can’t do any of those special fun things.	tsy afaka manao na inona na inona aminireo zavatra mahafinaritra manokana izahay
Even if no one is watching them.	na tsy misy mijery azy ireo aza
The world is very small.	kely tokoa izao tontolo izao
Sometimes it’s a small part.	indraindray dia ampahany kely
These are the last things.	ireo no zavatra farany
When you grow up, you will be perfect.	rehefa lasa lehibe ianao dia ho tanteraka
Very easy for them.	tena mora ho azy ireo
And thank you for saying that.	ary misaotra anao nilaza izany
He knew he was lost.	fantany fa very izy
No one is superior to that.	tsy misy olona ambony indrindra aminizany
But that will be no more.	tsy hisy intsony anefa izany
It’s not that hard.	tsy dia sarotra izany
What else could be wrong ?.	inona koa no mety ho diso
He is very similar.	tena mitovy izy
I have a lot of questions.	manana fanontaniana be dia be aho
In fact, he did it perfectly.	raha ny marina dia nanao izany tanteraka
This is my favorite part of the day.	ity no ampahany tiako indrindra aminny andro
It’s all together all the time.	izy rehetra miaraka aminny fotoana rehetra
We look good.	mijery tsara izahay
Not so for everyone.	tsy toy izany ho anny rehetra
And of course the future.	ary mazava ho azy ny ho avy
The war came.	tonga ny ady
No, they did see them.	tsia tena nahita azy ireo tokoa izy ireo
There will be no more.	tsy hisy intsony
They are it again.	izy ireo indray izany
Of course, we were happy to see them.	mazava ho azy fa faly izahay nahita azy ireo
He said there was nothing wrong.	nilaza izy fa tsy misy zavatra tsy mety
Some of it is very clear.	ny sasany aminizany dia mazava be
But one last thing.	zavatra iray farany anefa
Still working on the problem.	mbola miasa aminny olana
However, it may be too fast.	na izany aza mety ho haingana loatra izany
Expect great things.	manantena zavatra lehibe
You can never do anything and do the right thing.	tsy afaka manao na inona na inona mihitsy ianao ary manao ny tsara
But it’s more than just that.	saingy mihoatra noho izany fotsiny izany
True, this will not be easy.	marina fa tsy ho mora izany
Currently on.	aminizao fotoana izao aminny
And it stopped, which is fun.	ary nijanona izany izay mahafinaritra
The choice of location is less than that.	kely noho izany ny safidy toerana
There are still people there.	mbola misy olona ao
But he also had a good time.	nanana fotoana tsara koa anefa izy
Maybe it’s a little higher now.	somary ambony angamba izany ankehitriny
We will become a problem.	ho lasa olana isika
Of course, they are too early.	mazava ho azy fa aloha loatra izy ireo
I don’t have anything like that.	tsy manana zavatra toy izany aho
I know that, and so do you.	fantatro izany ary ianao koa
Sometimes you do produce.	indraindray ianao dia manao vokatra
Some people like to do it, others like to watch.	misy olona tia manao izany ny hafa tia mijery
I had no idea.	tsy nahita hevitra aho
Yes and that is it.	eny ary izany no izy
It of course stayed ahead.	dia mazava ho azy fa nijanona teo aloha
Lots of action.	betsaka ny hetsika
I love this picture.	tiako io sary io
However, we always do.	na izany aza dia manao izany foana izahay
It finally came.	tonga ihany ilay izy
It’s not very noticeable.	tsy dia hita loatra izany
It’s not that there’s no history.	tsy hoe tsy misy tantara izany
They always come here.	tonga eto foana izy ireo
He’s starting to lose it.	manomboka very izany izy
I hope that makes sense.	manantena aho fa misy dikany izany
A little good.	tsara kely
He was really fun.	tena nahafinaritra izy
We may never exist.	mety tsy hisy mihitsy isika
Life is good.	tsara ny fiainana
And he wasn’t the only one to say that.	ary tsy izy irery no nilaza izany
Surely you don’t know that.	azo antoka fa tsy fantatrao izany
He had a very good age.	nanana taona tena tsara izy
I think there is a first time in everything.	heveriko fa misy fotoana voalohany aminny zavadrehetra
There is not much to do evil.	tsy be atao ny ratsy
That must be a misconception.	tsy maintsy ho diso hevitra izany
He will lose his home.	ho very trano izy
This one was as hard as the last one.	ity iray ity dia mafy toy ny taminny farany
He even began to love himself.	nanomboka tia ny tenany mihitsy aza izy
It also has.	izy io koa dia manana
There was no safe place.	tsy nisy toerana azo antoka
Not one person.	tsy olona iray
But the truth is, the reality is not so simple.	saingy raha ny marina dia tsy dia tsotra loatra ny zavamisy
Everything has to be new.	ny zavadrehetra dia tokony ho vaovao
Often you don’t have it.	matetika dia tsy manana izany ianao
It’s really easy.	tena mora tokoa izany
Some people can do that.	ny olona sasany dia afaka manao izany
It is only there that it must exist or not.	ao ihany izy no tsy maintsy misy na tsia
The obvious thing.	ny zavatra mazava
These are not just words for me.	tsy teny fotsiny ho ahy ireo
The world is new.	vaovao ny tontolo
That's it.	dia izay izany
But it all seems far and away.	saingy toa lavitra sy lavitra izany rehetra izany
The world in a way loves good things.	izao tontolo izao aminny fomba tia zavatra tsara
No one died.	tsy misy maty
Come as soon as possible for him.	tonga haingana indrindra ho azy
It is also not enough.	tsy ampy koa izany
Good words.	ny teny tsara
It was as if he had seen me.	toy ny hoe nahita ahy izy
History, however, is history.	ny tantara anefa dia tantara
He is two years old.	roa taona izy
And you never saw them.	ary tsy nahita azy ireo mihitsy ianao
I see that often.	hitako matetika izany
But we should not be like that.	tsy tokony ho toy izany anefa isika
Now, that wasn’t much.	ankehitriny tsy dia nisy loatra izany
It’s really not a problem.	tena tsy olana izany
I see it as where we are.	hitako ho toerana misy antsika izany
He could have done more.	afaka nanao bebe kokoa izy
Maybe he could have done something else.	angamba afaka nanao zavatra hafa izy
This is done privately.	atao manokana izany
Just an old house.	trano taloha ihany
Now, never do that.	ankehitriny aza manao toy izany mihitsy
Apparently they didn’t.	toa tsy nanao izany izy ireo
I have two women together.	manana vehivavy roa miaraka aho
Make it look like one.	ataovy toy ny iray izy
At first we both said no.	samy nilaza izahay taminny voalohany hoe tsia
And it’s not the same as where he is.	ary tsy mitovy aminny toerana misy azy
Sure you are.	azo antoka fa ianao
I almost didn’t look.	saika tsy nijery aho
We are not here.	tsy eto isika
She will be fine.	ho tsara izy
That was it.	izany no tao
He told himself that it was not real.	nilaza ny tenany fa tsy tena izy izany
I think he is very lonely.	heveriko fa tena irery izy
I will still do it.	mbola hanao izany aho
Most importantly, all of them.	indrindra indrindra izy rehetra
I never liked him.	tsy tia azy mihitsy aho
To be full.	mba ho feno
He was confused at first.	very hevitra izy taminny voalohany
I don’t think you should be around me.	heveriko fa tsy tokony ho manodidina ahy ianao
Even a little.	na kely aza
This seems like a big problem for work.	toa olana be ho anny asa izany
Even if you made a fun story.	na dia nanao tantara mahafinaritra aza ianao
If you have a simple home, do it.	raha manana trano tsotra ianao dia hanao izany
It is very easy and convenient to do.	tena mora sy mora ny manao azy
And thank you, for everything.	ary misaotra anao aminny zavatra rehetra
I need to work.	mila miasa aho
So, nothing wrong is done in the end.	noho izany tsy misy ratsy atao aminny farany
You can go now, today, right now.	afaka mandeha ianao izao anio izao fotoana izao
But don’t take too long.	fa aza ela loatra
It will be difficult at first.	ho sarotra aminny voalohany
He doesn't need anything.	tsy mila zavatra izy
It will come to me.	ho tonga amiko izany
There were other reasons for the work.	nisy antony hafa koa teo aminny asa
I've seen this for a long time.	efa ela aho no nahita anio
He alone will do it.	izy ihany no hanao izany
Women, as for you.	vehivavy raha ny momba anao
He does his thing.	manao ny azy izy
They do the same here, for him.	manao toy izany koa izy ireo eto ho azy
I always see that.	hitako foana izany
No one saw anything.	tsy nisy nahita na inona na inona
Yes, yes, right.	eny eny marina
Maybe no problem.	angamba tsy misy olana
He is not always like that.	tsy toy izany foana izy
He had never had it before.	mbola tsy nanana izany mihitsy izy
Not at first, but yes.	tsy taminny voalohany fa eny
Sometimes it’s something else.	zavatra hafa izany indraindray
Of course we are.	mazava ho azy fa izahay
And he knew he knew it.	ary fantany fa fantany izany
Once and for all.	indray mandeha sy izay rehetra
He could not say clearly why.	tsy afaka nilaza mazava ny antony izy
Both are not worth the work.	samy tsy mendrika ny asa
They are even more numerous.	betsaka kokoa koa izy ireo
There is a clear time.	misy fotoana mazava
But it’s not easy.	saingy tsy mora izany
The best there is.	ny tsara indrindra misy
They are far away.	lavitra izy ireo
It’s really fun.	tena mahafinaritra azy
I will always love him.	ho tia azy foana aho
But that is certainly not true.	saingy azo antoka fa tsy marina izany
We all had to do it.	tsy maintsy nanao izany isika rehetra
It makes no other sense.	tsy misy dikany hafa izany
I hope everything made sense.	manantena aho fa nisy dikany ny zavadrehetra
I don’t like that either.	tsy tiako koa izany
Maybe that makes sense.	misy dikany angamba izany
It can never be anything else with him.	tsy mety ho zavatra hafa mihitsy izany miaraka aminy
Where there is no woman.	izay tsy misy vehivavy
It works perfectly.	miasa tanteraka izany
i have enough.	manana ny ampy aho
Here is an option.	ity misy safidy iray
But it can’t.	saingy tsy afaka izany
I saw that he was dead.	hitako izy fa maty
It was more fun.	nahafinaritra kokoa izany
This is not a simple process.	tsy dingana tsotra izany
Then he was the only one happy.	dia izy ihany no faly
Of course, that’s a really good thing.	mazava ho azy fa zavatra tena tsara izany
You don’t know where you are.	tsy fantatrao ny toerana misy anao
The car will not do that.	tsy hanao izany ny fiara
Yes, we can't.	eny tsy afaka izahay
Sometimes, it’s really necessary.	indraindray tena ilaina
That’s what he likes.	izany no tiany
He will do anything for me.	hanao na inona na inona ho ahy izy
He knew he was confused.	fantany fa efa very hevitra izy
Like that was the worst.	toy ny hoe izay no ratsy indrindra
He now had to look at where they were.	tsy maintsy nijery ny toerana misy azy ireo izy izao
Kind of does it.	karazana manao izany
Nothing else is needed.	tsy misy zavatra hafa ilaina
Of course, they didn't know it at first.	mazava ho azy fa tsy fantany izany taminny voalohany
It will be a fun event.	ho hetsika mahafinaritra izany
Which is ours.	izay antsika
Good reason.	antony tsara
He always did.	nanao izany foana izy
However, it is enough.	na izany aza dia ampy
So are they.	toy izany koa izy ireo
They still love me.	mbola tia ahy izy ireo
Just look inside and around you.	jereo fotsiny ny ao anatiny sy ny manodidina anao
In fact, he has already started.	raha ny marina dia efa nanomboka izy
We work in the same place.	miasa aminny toerana mitovy izahay
He never stopped, never alone.	tsy nijanona mihitsy izy tsy irery mihitsy
I love the timing.	tiako ny fotoana
Sometimes it seems trivial, sometimes not so much.	indraindray dia toa tsy misy dikany izany indraindray tsy dia be loatra
The old woman loved the house.	tia ny trano ilay vehivavy taloha
Without it, nothing matters.	raha tsy misy azy dia tsy misy zavadehibe
I know it doesn’t make sense.	fantatro fa tsy misy dikany izany
However, no matter what, it is important.	na izany aza na inona na inona dia zavadehibe izany
But that never works.	tsy mandeha mihitsy anefa izany
I knew they were there.	fantatro fa any izy ireo
And yet, they become meaningless.	ary na izany aza dia lasa tsy misy dikany izy ireo
This place is good.	tsara ity toerana ity
But not this one.	fa tsy ity
It is high time.	tena fotoana izao
I have to do them again.	tsy maintsy manao azy ireo indray aho
She knew he loved her.	fantany fa tia azy izy
If you want.	raha tianao
I hope you can do the same.	manantena aho fa afaka manao toy izany koa ianao
I saw it.	nahita izany aho
There seemed to be nothing wrong.	toa tsy nisy diso
Didn't see it coming.	tsy nahita anio tonga io
If you can, that is it.	raha azonao atao dia izay
We do it here.	manao izany izahay eto
It wasn’t right, but it was there.	tsy mety izany fa teo mihitsy
Well and that’s how it started.	eny ary izany no nanomboka
Even worse, you actually did it.	mbola ratsy kokoa aza tena nanao izany ianao
We are more and better.	betsaka kokoa isika ary tsara kokoa
And it works easily.	ary miasa mora foana
They did not die.	tsy maty izy ireo
I see it clearly.	hitako tsara izany
For everyone.	ho anny tsirairay
I like to do simple things.	tiako ny manao zavatra tsotra
I have a problem in part.	manana olana aminny ampahany aho
You are not the same.	tsy mitovy ianao
Nothing is too good for men.	tsy misy zavatra tsara loatra aminny lehilahy
Not theirs.	tsy azy ireo
He gets what he wants in every way necessary.	mahazo izay tiany aminny fomba rehetra ilaina izy
Now everything is clear.	aminizao fotoana izao dia mazava ny zavadrehetra
Things don’t seem to be going well.	toa tsy tsara ny zavatra
He could say what he wanted.	afaka nilaza izay tiany izy
Yes, there was such a thing.	eny nisy toy izany
It was all well done.	natao tsara daholo izany rehetra izany
You are not happy either.	tsy faly koa ianao
You cannot be the highest of them.	tsy afaka ny ho ambony indrindra aminizy ireo ianao
Which really means a lot to me.	izay tena misy dikany amiko
Or work, really.	na asa tena
Everything will be the same.	ho toy izany koa ny zavadrehetra
Here's the thing.	izao ny zavatra
They are not lost.	tsy very izy ireo
It will be very hard.	ho mafy be izany
It was a good day.	andro tsara izany
Women are never free.	tsy afaka mihitsy ny vehivavy
This is not an old story to you.	tsy tantara taloha izany aminao
And now he was in the news.	ary izao izy dia tao aminny vaovao
But not everything.	saingy tsy ny zavadrehetra
I didn’t stay too long in one place.	tsy nijanona ela loatra taminny toerana iray aho
But he is coming soon.	fa ho avy tsy ho ela izy
The house was lovely.	nahafinaritra ilay trano
There are three problems.	misy olana telo
It was very difficult for him.	tena sarotra taminy izany
This is great news.	vaovao be ity
Then, go.	avy eo nandeha
You understand the problem here.	azonao ny olana eto
It’s a very special thing.	tena zavatra manokana izany
He knew he needed to do something about it.	fantany fa mila manao zavatra momba izany izy
Hard news came to him.	nisy mafy vaovao tonga taminy
There has to be one somewhere.	tsy maintsy misy iray any ho any
The fact is they are all beautiful.	ny zavamisy dia tsara tarehy daholo izy ireo
I don’t know who would love someone like that.	tsy fantatro izay ho tia olona toy izany
He walks fast.	mandeha haingana izy
I never thought it could be this good.	tsy nieritreritra mihitsy aho hoe mety ho tsara toy izao izany
Taste, taste, taste.	lasa lasa lasa
Very simple and very fast.	tena tsotra ary tena haingana
You can work with.	afaka miasa aminny
This part is meaningless.	tsy misy dikany io ampahany io
The work is not as good as it could be.	ny asa dia tsy tsara araka izay azo atao
Life was hard for me.	sarotra tamiko ny fiainana
He will be happy with me.	ho faly amiko izy
It seems so necessary.	toa tena ilaina izany
Look, there.	jereo any
It didn’t stop even for a day.	tsy nijanona na dia iray andro aza
But they will be wrong again.	mbola ho diso hevitra indray anefa izy ireo
It's all yours.	anao daholo izany
But there are two problems here.	saingy misy olana roa eto
We will never be here.	tsy ho eto mihitsy izahay
That’s not a good reason.	tsy antony tsara izany
Wrong at first.	diso hevitra taminny voalohany
I am a good man.	lehilahy tsara aho
I always wanted to do something different.	te hanao zavatra hafa foana aho
And he’s not too low anymore.	ary tsy dia ambany loatra intsony izy
I find that to be all a fact.	hitako fa zavamisy daholo izany
And they generally do.	ary aminny ankapobeny dia manao izany izy ireo
I need to not look at you.	mila tsy mijery anao aho
We used to go to photography.	nandeha tany aminny sary izahay taloha
It took him a while to be really happy.	nila fotoana kely izy vao tena faly
But not all questions are the same.	tsy mitovy anefa ny fanontaniana rehetra
Food is just food.	ny sakafo dia sakafo fotsiny
It could be three, but no more.	mety ho telo fa tsy mihoatra izany
But in a different way.	saingy aminny fomba hafa
A little movement.	hetsika kely
Which would be a good thing.	izay mety ho zavatra tsara
It's not for me.	tsy ho ahy izany
I'm doing a good job.	manao asa tsara aho
He didn’t have much of that problem either.	tsy dia nanana izany olana izany koa izy
You did a really good job.	nanao asa tena tsara ianao
Only one of them is different from the other.	ny iray aminireo ihany no tsy mitovy aminny hafa
Yes, too bad.	eny ratsy loatra
With a very difficult task.	miaraka aminny asa sarotra be
Everyone has to do it for themselves.	tsy maintsy manao izany ho anny tenany ny tsirairay
That is the real reason.	izay no tena antony
The reality is far worse.	ny tena zavamisy dia ratsy lavitra
It’s just one person.	olona iray ihany izany
With them.	miaraka aminizy ireo
However, it is not perfect.	na izany aza tsy tanteraka
With real people.	miaraka aminny olona tena izy
I think that’s really important.	heveriko fa tena zavadehibe izany
Anyway, good food.	na izany na tsy izany sakafo tsara
He is still here.	mbola eto izy
There were men too.	nisy lehilahy koa
And this is for two main reasons.	ary izany dia noho ny antony roa lehibe
He will do small things.	hanao zavatra kely izy
But he really knew what he wanted.	fa tena fantany izay tiany
Maybe it wasn’t that hard.	angamba tsy dia mafy ilay izy
But you get the point.	azonao ny hevitra anefa
So they are a good idea.	noho izany dia hevitra tsara izy ireo
She is a busy and busy woman.	vehivavy be atao sy be atao izy
It wasn't like he was there now.	tsy toy ny hoe tao izy izao
Other lives are not for me.	ny fiainana hafa dia tsy ho ahy
But they are not happy.	tsy faly anefa izy ireo
But he had done so before.	efa nanao izany anefa izy taloha
He did a good thing and had a lot of fun.	nanao zavatra tsara izy ary nahafinaritra be
It was definitely harder.	azo antoka fa mafy kokoa ilay izy
Next time.	aminny manaraka
There was nothing real about it.	tsy nisy na inona na inona marina momba izany
He didn’t say it would be difficult for me.	tsy nilaza izy hoe ho sarotra amiko izany
Don't crowd.	aza atao be olona
Because they had the best fit.	satria izy ireo no nanana ny mety indrindra
It seems to be going well.	toa mandeha tsara
He said he does.	nilaza izy fa manao izany
We have to go now.	tsy maintsy mandeha isika izao
This idea is very misplaced.	tena diso toerana io hevitra io
I need an idea.	mila hevitra aho
But they work well for me.	saingy miasa tsara ho ahy izy ireo
I hope it gets better now.	manantena aho fa tsara kokoa izao
We need to do something real.	mila manao zavatra tena izy isika
I seem to be struggling.	toa sarotra aho
I saw too much.	be loatra ny hitako
It's not a matter of words.	tsy resaka teny
They both did a wonderful job.	nanao asa mahafinaritra izy roa
I should have done more.	tokony ho nanao bebe kokoa aho
Become a completely different person.	lasa olona hafa tanteraka
And he said.	ka hoy izy
I said I could.	nilaza aho fa afaka
The trip went well.	nandeha tsara ilay dia
They do the work.	izy ireo no manao ny asa
But that is wrong.	diso anefa izany
I want to do great things.	te hanao zavatra lehibe aho
There should be no such thing.	tsy tokony hisy ny toy izany
Maybe he shouldn’t have done all that.	angamba tsy tokony ho nanao izany rehetra izany izy
It’s safer.	azo antoka kokoa izany
And that is especially true now.	ary tena marina izany ankehitriny
You have to be first at all times.	tokony ho voalohany aminny fotoana rehetra ianao
It used to be very simple.	tsotra be izany taloha
It is life.	fiainana izany
Now they are just people.	ankehitriny dia olona fotsiny izy ireo
This game is better.	tsara kokoa ity lalao ity
I have no idea at all.	tsy manana hevitra mihitsy aho
You have to get to it fast.	tsy maintsy tonga haingana aminizany ianao
It seems to be the same.	toa izao ihany
Being alone is not a problem for me.	tsy olana amiko ny hoe irery
It has to be for him.	tsy maintsy ho azy izany
And you are.	ary ianao dia
It doesn’t matter, but it’s really good.	tsy misy dikany fa tena tsara
Many loved him.	maro no tia azy
But choice and location are important.	zavadehibe anefa ny safidy sy ny toerana
I also have a very special time.	manana fotoana manokana manokana koa aho
He didn’t like it in the slightest.	tsy tiany izany na dia kely aza
And everyone seems to love him.	ary toa tia azy ny rehetra
Time is very limited.	ny fotoana dia tena kely
You are too much.	be loatra ianao
Lots of work.	be ny asa
In fact, we will be very bad.	raha ny marina dia ho ratsy be isika
You need to do that though.	mila manao izany ianao na izany aza
He doesn't even look like a fool.	tsy toy ny adala akory izy
But not at all.	saingy tsy izany mihitsy
It could be.	mety ho
With i.	miaraka aminny i
In fact, if you don’t need me.	raha ny marina raha tsy mila ahy ianao
And they love you.	ary tia anao izy ireo
This is just not a good idea.	tsy hevitra tsara fotsiny izany
You shouldn't be like that either.	tsy tokony ho toy izany koa ianao
So you can go.	ka afaka mandeha ianao
This is not a new day.	tsy andro vaovao izao
I think it’s around it.	heveriko fa manodidina azy io
That could be bad.	mety ho ratsy izany
There must be a war.	tsy maintsy misy ady
This story is no longer to be found.	tsy hita intsony io tantara io
We all need you.	mila anao izahay rehetra
It could be.	mety ho azy io
They often did.	matetika izy ireo no nanao izany
Not yet.	tsy mbola izay
I have something else for you.	manana zavatra hafa ho anao
It may be difficult, but it is not possible.	mety ho sarotra izany saingy tsy azo atao izany
A little talk.	resaka kely
But they were there.	teo anefa izy ireo
But that is not the end.	saingy tsy izany no farany
He now says he likes it.	nilaza izy izao fa tiany ilay izy
You need to get one, they are fun.	mila mahazo iray ianao mahafinaritra izy ireo
And it always will be.	ary ho toy izany foana izy
It won't be a problem.	tsy ho olana izy
He said something really bad.	nilaza zavatra tena ratsy izy
I needed time alone.	nila fotoana irery aho
He never did it again.	tsy nanao izany intsony izy
That is of course true.	izay no marina mazava ho azy
He needs a special place.	mila toerana manokana izy
He finally did the right thing.	nanao zavatra mendrika izy taminny farany
It all works but there are problems.	miasa daholo fa misy olana
Looking around again, it doesn’t make sense.	mijery manodidina indray tsy misy dikany
And work on it more.	ary miasa aminizany bebe kokoa
He still loves her, and he knows she will always love him.	mbola tia azy foana izy ary fantany fa ho tia azy foana izy
However, you are absolutely right.	na izany aza tena marina ianao
It’s really about where it started.	tena momba izay nanomboka izany
They were about to do it.	saika hanao izany izy ireo
He still didn't like the house.	mbola tsy tiany mihitsy ilay trano
The men looked inside.	nijery tao anatiny ireo lehilahy
Very bad idea.	hevitra tena ratsy
He will be found.	ho hita izy
There is no reality.	tsy misy ny zavamisy
We have two options here.	manana safidy roa isika eto
It's hard for me.	sarotra amiko
He will be gone.	tsy hisy intsony izy
So it has to be great.	noho izany dia tsy maintsy ho lehibe
Time was meaningless.	tsy nisy dikany ny fotoana
This seems like a difficult idea to some people.	toa hevitra sarotra ho anny olona sasany izany
Words should be.	teny tokony ho
There are other ways.	misy fomba hafa
Just happy to do it.	faly fotsiny manao izany
None of these jobs are full -time.	tsy misy aminireo asa ireo no feno fotoana
Or not specifically.	na tsy manokana
People will lose money.	ho very vola ny olona
Yet the story is the same.	na izany aza ny tantara ihany
But he still loves me.	fa mbola tia ahy izy
It’s just worth it.	mendrika fotsiny izany
I have to see you.	tsy maintsy mahita anao aho
They may have an idea, he said.	mety manana hevitra izy ireo hoy izy
We had the best of both worlds.	nanana ny tsara indrindra taminny tontolo roa izahay
Of course, he is not stupid.	mazava ho azy fa tsy adala izy
Still good though.	mbola tsara ihany fa
But not so with us.	tsy toy izany anefa ny antsika
Even if you are a woman.	na dia vehivavy aza ianao
After two.	rehefa afaka roa
This is the good part.	ity no ampahany tsara
There had to be something else.	tsy maintsy nisy zavatra hafa noho izany
They can also be pretty accurate.	mety ho marina tsara koa izy ireo
He looked at them.	nijery azy ireo izy
He knows all about me.	fantany ny momba ahy rehetra
But, it doesn’t.	saingy tsy manao izany
But there are many other options.	misy safidy maro hafa koa anefa
They look good.	toa tsara izy ireo
Of course, it makes more sense there.	mazava ho azy fa misy dikany kokoa aminizany any
And then of course, make sure to follow through.	ary avy eo mazava ho azy ataovy azo antoka ny manaraka
For now, that is enough.	aminizao fotoana izao dia ampy izay
Nice to see you.	faly mahita anao
That's where the car is now.	teo no misy ilay fiara aminizao fotoana izao
It stopped.	nijanona izy io
I want you to understand that.	tiako ho azonao izany
I've been getting one for a long time.	efa ela aho no nahazo iray
It was never discussed.	tsy nisy resaka mihitsy izany
Day you love.	andro izay tianao
It's been a while.	efa ela
I need him to be happy.	mila azy aho mba ho faly
He may be wrong.	mety ho diso lalana izy
But that was not the case.	tsy tena nisy anefa izany
No wrong.	tsia tsy mety
He has another one.	manana iray hafa izy
We don’t need it now.	tsy mila izany isika ankehitriny
You see another car moving.	nahita fiara hafa mandeha ianao
It’s tough on that.	mafy izy aminizany
It didn't make sense to me at first.	tsy nisy dikany tamiko izany taminny voalohany
This is the easiest way.	izany no fomba mora indrindra
And then it gets better and better.	ary avy eo dia lasa tsara kokoa sy tsara kokoa
I don’t think it makes sense, though.	heveriko tsy misy dikany izany na izany aza
And with good reason.	ary aminny antony tsara
You have come to the right place.	tonga aminny toerana mety ianao
He said there were no questions about it.	nilaza izy fa tsy misy fanontaniana momba izany
But we are still here.	saingy mbola eto ihany isika
And the new path found is.	ary ny lalana vaovao hita dia
Maybe they never said anything.	angamba tsy nilaza na inona na inona mihitsy izy ireo
Tonight is the last time for us.	ity alina ity no fotoana farany ho antsika
Others were already there.	efa teo koa ny hafa
But more remains to be done.	mbola betsaka kokoa anefa no tsy maintsy atao
A lot is lost.	be dia be ny very
It’s meaningless and meaningless.	tsy misy dikany sy tsy misy dikany
It’s about time, too.	momba ny fotoana koa
But even if they didn’t, no one would be lost.	fa na dia tsy nanao izany aza izy ireo dia tsy hisy ho very
So, no problem.	noho izany tsy misy olana
It’s already starting to happen.	efa manomboka misy izany
Maybe a man.	angamba lehilahy
They could draw whatever they wanted.	afaka nanao sary izay rehetra tiany izy ireo
It was a good place for people to watch.	toerana tsara ho anny olona nijery izany
Or, perhaps, they are the best.	na angamba izy ireo no tsara indrindra
Very small and fast.	tena kely sy haingana
A lot of people saw it coming.	be dia be ny olona nahita izany ho avy
You did it.	ianao no nanao izany
And there are other reasons as well.	ary misy antony hafa koa
This is the best path for them.	izany no lalana tsara indrindra ho azy ireo
I am human.	olona aho
But they are never found.	saingy tsy hita mihitsy izy ireo
It seemed so far away.	toa lavitra be ilay izy
Not a single one was lost.	tsy very na dia iray aza
It takes money.	mila vola izany
It’s totally crazy.	adala tanteraka izany
He will know everything.	ho fantany ny zavadrehetra
I love all these people.	tiako daholo ireo olona ireo
Not enough three.	tsy ampy telo
I've seen it.	efa hitako izany
We have that too.	manana izany koa isika
We may never get there.	mety tsy ho tonga any mihitsy isika
Never before.	mbola tsy nisy teo aloha
I'm not completely stupid.	tsy adala tanteraka aho
It must be a good story.	tsy maintsy tantara tsara ilay izy
But he knew it was true.	fantany anefa fa marina izany
But no one came.	tsy nisy anefa tonga
I’ve always thought of doing that myself.	efa nieritreritra ny hanao izany mihitsy aho
He doesn’t do that anymore.	tsy manao izany intsony izy
This is not a difficult thing.	tsy zavatra sarotra izany
That would be good news.	ho vaovao tsara momba izany
Money problems don’t go away overnight.	ny olana aminny vola dia tsy mandeha aminny alina
We are dead.	maty isika
I saw many dead.	nahita maro maty aho
We stopped.	nijanona izahay
I don’t get time alone with you.	tsy mahazo fotoana irery miaraka aminao aho
Apparently not you.	toa tsy ianao
I'm dying to see you.	maty aho mahita anao
I think it should probably be.	heveriko fa tokony ho izany angamba
After that, it is sometimes necessary.	rehefa afaka izany dia ilaina indraindray
But what is right.	fa inona no mety
It’s not that it’s a trivial matter.	tsy hoe misy resaka tsy misy dikany
Other times they made me.	taminny fotoana hafa dia nanao ahy izy ireo
They are, in fact, far more than that.	izy ireo raha ny marina dia mihoatra lavitra
It's only today.	anio ihany izany
We still agree.	mbola mitovy hevitra foana izahay
In fact, the rest of us may not be here either.	raha ny marina dia mety tsy ho eto koa isika hafa
But there was no way out.	tsy nisy fomba azo natao anefa
The world should do better.	tokony hanao tsara kokoa izao tontolo izao
But, in fact, right now.	saingy raha ny marina aminizao fotoana izao
Food is another story.	ny sakafo dia tantara hafa
But these are not.	tsy ireo anefa ireo
Those days are gone.	efa lasa ireo andro ireo
They are often wrong.	diso izy ireo matetika
That sounds good.	toa tsara izany
He really loves women.	tena tia vehivavy izy
That’s probably where it is.	izay angamba no misy azy
And I saw that he did.	ary hitako fa nanao izany izy
There are other meals to come.	misy sakafo hafa ho avy
They are very wrong.	tena diso hevitra izy ireo
Which is kind of meant to be in the present.	izay karazana natao ho eo aminizao fotoana izao
Life is good now.	tsara ny fiainana ankehitriny
He did not even look at them.	tsy nijery azy ireo akory izy
Hope you love it !.	manantena ianao fa tia azy
But the problem remained.	saingy nijanona ny olana
Which, of course, is not the case.	izay mazava ho azy tsy izany
I don’t want you to be mistaken.	tsy tiako ho diso hevitra ianao
This is great.	ity no lehibe
But this is not entirely wrong.	tsy diso tanteraka anefa izany
They are one person.	olona iray izy ireo
It is not uncommon to have only one.	tsy mahazatra ny manana iray ihany
I see two reasons.	antony roa no hitako
But there are problems with this process.	misy olana anefa aminity dingana ity
And almost everyone around him does.	ary saika izay rehetra manodidina azy no manao izany
Real choice.	tena safidy
I think that would be good.	heveriko fa ho tsara izany
Maybe it is.	angamba izy io
He is evil and insignificant.	ratsy sy tsy misy dikany izy
I think it should.	heveriko fa tokony
He also saw a man driving.	nahita lehilahy nandeha fiara ihany koa izy
I'm glad you're beautiful.	faly aho fa tsara tarehy ianao
Thanks always.	misaotra foana
It was his greatest moment.	izany no fotoana lehibe indrindra taminy
Admittedly, it’s not very visible.	marina fa tsy dia hita loatra
The time has come for it to be a reality.	tonga ny fotoana tokony ho zavamisy
He is everywhere.	eny rehetra eny izy
It’s very similar to life.	tena mitovy aminny fiainana izany
He never needed me.	tsy nila ahy mihitsy izy
It’s in another place.	ao aminny toerana hafa izany
He hadn't looked at her yet.	mbola tsy nijery azy izy
It looks really big.	toa tena lehibe tokoa izy io
No one does that at all.	tsy misy manao izany mihitsy
It was hard to find him.	sarotra ny nahita azy
Don't do this.	aza manao izao
They are all around you too.	eo aminny manodidina anao koa izy ireo
And so it’s really beautiful.	ary noho izany dia tena tsara tarehy
Because one is never sure.	satria tsy azo antoka mihitsy ny olona iray
I haven’t gone to one yet.	mbola tsy nandeha taminny iray aho
And it’s not a bad life.	ary tsy fiainana ratsy izany
Good stuff too.	zavatra tsara koa
We would be better off without him.	tsara kokoa isika raha tsy nisy azy
So maybe they’re not very good.	ka angamba tsy dia tsara loatra izy ireo
He saw no reason.	tsy nahita antony iray izy
His favorite job is fighting.	ny asa tiany indrindra dia ny ady
But this is not the time.	tsy izao anefa no fotoana
All the news is there.	ao daholo ny vaovao
We are working on that.	miasa aminizany zavatra izany izahay
Someone else got it first.	olona hafa no nahazo izany voalohany
They must be confused.	tsy maintsy ho very hevitra izy ireo
It was a woman.	vehivavy ilay izy
And so is the journey.	ary dia toy izany koa ny dia
I thought of the word now.	nieritreritra ny teny aho izao
It’s just one person.	olona iray ihany io
We hope you like it.	manantena izahay fa tianao izany
He will do something about it.	hanao zavatra momba izany izy
This is not a bad idea.	tsy hoe hevitra ratsy izany
Once upon a time there was.	indray mandeha dia nisy
Not too optimistic.	tsy dia manantena loatra
He did it, you know.	izy no nanao izany fantatrao
Something bigger than life.	zavatra lehibe noho ny fiainana
I always did that.	nanao toy izany hatrany aho
They don't matter to him.	tsy misy dikany aminy ireo
Real work.	tena asa
Many of them don’t see a single one.	maro aminireo dia tsy mahita na dia iray aza
They go.	mandeha izy ireo
Everyone needs money.	mila vola ny rehetra
We are human beings first.	olona aloha isika
He does the same.	manao izany koa izy
It’s not a matter of anything in particular.	tsy resaka na inona na inona manokana
One of these may be true for some people.	ny iray aminireo dia mety ho marina aminny olona sasany
Because there is no action, no action.	satria tsy misy hetsika tsy misy asa
To be sure.	mba ho azo antoka
The end result seems to be the same.	ny vokatra farany dia toa mitovy
But they do.	manao azy ireo anefa
You know, if you need it.	fantatrao raha mila izany ianao
Then we were left alone.	dia nijanona irery izahay
I haven’t lost two.	tsy very roa aho
Best idea.	hevitra tsara indrindra
I have good news and bad news.	manana vaovao tsara sy vaovao ratsy aho
Many, many more.	maro maro hafa
Something for everyone out there !.	zavatra ho anny rehetra any
They all stayed there.	nijanona teo izy rehetra
You looked the other way.	nijery taminny fomba hafa ianao
And there are a lot of them.	ary misy be dia be
They didn’t seem to be before.	toa tsy teo aloha izy ireo
There is always the worse.	misy foana ny ratsy kokoa
So this whole story is really nonsense.	noho izany dia tena tsy misy dikany izany tantara rehetra izany
Don't look at me.	aza mijery ahy
Simple working people.	olona miasa tsotra
So the world makes sense.	ka izao tontolo izao misy dikany
There is a common method.	misy fomba mahazatra
We had it, they said.	nanana azy izahay hoy izy ireo
He could have done it, he knew.	afaka nanao izany izy fantany
And there was, and there was.	ary nisy izany ary nisy izy
It seems impossible.	toa tsy azo natao izany
I loved the people there.	tiako ny olona tao
There's something you don't know about me.	misy zavatra tsy fantatrao momba ahy
But he said nothing about it.	saingy tsy nilaza na inona na inona momba izany izy
But the results are the same.	saingy ny vokatra dia mitovy
And that is for sure.	ary azo antoka izany
I think he is very right.	heveriko fa tena marina izy
I know that perfectly well.	fantatro tanteraka izany
But especially you.	fa indrindra ianao
I’m as happy as I can be.	faly aho araka izay azo atao
It’s not that important now.	tsy hoe zavadehibe izao
They do not walk alone.	tsy mandeha irery izy ireo
But he is not.	fa tsy izy
That is the next problem.	izay no olana manaraka
Many things can go wrong.	mety ho diso ny zavatra maro
You don’t have to.	tsy manana ianao
Or we won’t.	na tsy hanao izany isika
And you don’t have to do that.	ary tsy mila manao izany ianao
She doesn't love him anymore.	tsy tia azy intsony izy
But he did not want to do that.	tsy te hanao izany anefa izy
But it is very practical.	tena mety anefa izany
He had a special question for them.	nanana fanontaniana manokana ho azy ireo izy
I had to do something right.	tsy maintsy nanao zavatra tsara aho
Yes, it must be.	eny tsy maintsy izany no izy
They simply exist.	misy tsotra izao izy ireo
They are good for us.	tsara ho antsika izy ireo
And we will not be happy together.	ary tsy ho faly isika miaraka
This is the most difficult process.	ity no dingana sarotra indrindra
We were already there.	efa tany izahay
Finally, he looked at her.	farany nijery azy izy
I used to do that.	matetika aho no nanao izany
The house was heavily secured, for a reason.	ny trano dia natao antoka mafy noho ny antony iray
Especially one of them, you know which one.	indrindra fa ny iray aminizy ireo fantatrao izay iray
She loves food.	tia sakafo izy
It’s fun, yes, but it’s also really challenging.	mahafinaritra eny fa tena sarotra ihany koa
But not immediately.	saingy tsy avy hatrany
You are very good.	tsara be ianao
Each type of car is unique.	ny karazana fiara tsirairay dia manokana
Not easy, but whatever you want.	tsy mora fa izay rehetra tianao
She is very good.	tena tsara izy
I love them all.	tiako daholo izy ireo
In fact, the timing couldn’t have been better.	raha ny marina tsy mety ho tsara kokoa ny fotoana
It may not be as important.	mety tsy ho toy ny zavadehibe
It was a good year for me personally.	taona tsara ho ahy manokana io
But there is not enough space.	tsy ampy anefa ny toerana
So, the good becomes great.	noho izany ny tsara dia lasa lehibe
So you may not do that now.	noho izany dia mety tsy hanao izany izao
If so, we are many.	raha izany no izy dia betsaka isika
There is evil everywhere.	misy ny ratsy eny rehetra eny
It will definitely be a real job.	azo antoka fa ho tena asa izy
If he is not found, he is lost.	raha tsy hita izy dia very
Because there really is no problem here.	satria tena tsy misy olana eto
He seemed to need her there.	toa nila azy tany izy
He died before.	maty izy taloha
I love it, it’s so beautiful.	tiako izany tena tsara tarehy
I made the wrong choice again.	diso safidy indray aho
It’s a simple matter.	resaka tsotra izany
It looked like the dead man.	toa ilay maty ilay izy
He could have said.	afaka nilaza izy
But then he didn't know.	tsy fantany anefa avy eo
It’s totally full.	feno tanteraka izany
Then again, it may not be the right time.	avy eo indray mety tsy ho ny fotoana mety
The current location is empty.	foana ny toerana ankehitriny
Lots and lots of cheap.	be dia be mora
Maybe that’s good.	tsara angamba izany
This man is small.	kely io lehilahy io
Yes, we have good results.	eny manana vokatra tsara izahay
I know that.	fantatro izany
And he just didn’t go.	ary tsy nandeha fotsiny izy
It’s not too hard, but it’s all fun.	tsy sarotra be fa mahafinaritra ny rehetra
Immediately above.	avy hatrany ambony
At that time.	taminizany fotoana izany
Not the age either.	tsy ny taona koa
If so, the result is correct.	raha eny dia marina ny vokatra
But there was something else about him.	saingy nisy zavatra hafa momba azy
If that was enough, they could go.	raha ampy izany dia afaka nandeha izy ireo
The bad one as the next.	ny iray ratsy toy ny manaraka
You have to know the type.	tsy maintsy fantatrao ny karazana
But they are too big.	saingy lehibe loatra izy ireo
You have a good one.	manana iray tsara ianao
But it’s only recently.	saingy vao haingana izany
Then they lost us.	dia very antsika izy ireo
Same thing if anything else.	zavatra iray ihany raha misy hafa
The truth is they will never know.	ny tena marina dia tsy ho fantany mihitsy
But it turns out there was more to the story.	saingy hita fa nisy bebe kokoa ny tantara
He could be great.	mety ho lehibe izy
It will be found instantly everywhere.	ho hita eo no ho eo eny rehetra eny
This is not your place.	tsy toerana misy anao ity
Such methods are generally common.	ny fomba toy izany aminny ankapobeny dia mahazatra
I had a better idea.	nanana hevitra tsara kokoa aho
Simple action.	hetsika tsotra
And it was all fun.	ary nahafinaritra ny rehetra
But they are men.	lehilahy anefa izy ireo
He is not alone yet.	mbola tsy irery izy
I saw it in action recently.	hitako taminny hetsika izany vao haingana
Faster is better.	haingana no tsara kokoa
Perhaps he should have known that the man was not alone.	tokony ho fantany angamba fa tsy irery ilay lehilahy
A lot of people are already doing that.	efa betsaka ny olona manao izany
And everyone else.	ary ny hafa rehetra
Thank you for watching.	misaotra anao nijery
She really loves photography.	tena tia sary izy
This issue is great for walking around.	ity olana ity dia tena tsara ho anny mandeha manodidina
This one just isn’t true.	tsy marina fotsiny ity iray ity
Other times they can’t.	aminny fotoana hafa dia tsy afaka izy ireo
And it’s really hard.	ary tena sarotra izany
It’s a big world.	tontolo lehibe io
I hope you will be happy one day.	manantena aho fa ho faly ianao indray mandeha
It should be.	tokony ho izany
He’s not too talkative.	tsy dia be resaka loatra izy
Then there was a war.	dia nisy ady
Yes, it can.	eny afaka izany
But I can't.	tsy afaka anefa aho
As for this issue.	raha ny momba ity olana ity
I knew right away.	tonga dia fantany aho
It’s nothing, either.	tsy na inona na inona na
To this house.	ho aminity trano ity
And again, you usually do this on your own.	ary indray matetika ianao no manao anio manokana
And it’s very fast.	ary haingana dia haingana izany
He quickly looked around.	nijery haingana ny manodidina azy izy
But he may be wrong.	mety ho diso hevitra anefa izy
The words around it didn't even make sense.	tsy nisy dikany mihitsy aza ny teny manodidina azy
Yes it is.	eny izany
The present is not possible.	tsy azo atao ny ankehitriny
I find it working, great time.	hitako fa miasa fotoana lehibe
You are no better than him.	tsy tsara noho izy ianao
No one is here at all.	tsy misy olona eto mihitsy
So you lose a lot.	noho izany dia very betsaka ianao
In fact, he deserves to be worse.	raha ny marina dia mendrika ny ho ratsy kokoa izy
And that was only the first day.	ary io ihany no andro voalohany
It is not enough for him.	tsy ampy ho azy izany
I think he is right.	heveriko fa marina ny azy
He didn’t need me to do that.	tsy nila ahy hanao izany izy
The contents are not the same.	tsy mitovy ny ao anatiny
Sounds good actually, doesn’t it.	toa tsara raha ny marina tsy izany
I’ve been thinking and thinking about it.	efa nieritreritra sy nieritreritra izany aho
It's the first day of the new year.	andro voalohany aminny taona vaovao izao
They are not and they know it.	tsy izy ireo ary fantany izany
They go again.	mandeha indray izy ireo
This is the most common reason.	izany no antony mahazatra indrindra
We have yet to see a future.	mbola tsy nahita ho avy isika
Either way, he knows the facts.	na izany na tsy izany fantany ny zavamisy
From then on, however, things were very simple.	nanomboka teo anefa dia tena tsotra ny zavatra
Nothing is too good.	tsy misy zavatra tsara loatra
I know about him, but not everything.	fantatro ny momba azy saingy tsy ny zavadrehetra
It will not be enough.	tsy ho ampy izany
It's about me.	momba ahy io
He looked at all of us who were there.	nijery anay rehetra izay teo izy
But it was not like humans.	tsy toy ny olona anefa ilay izy
I enjoyed it.	nahafinaritra ahy ilay izy
And it seems so.	ary toa izany no izy
It never happens automatically.	tsy mandeha ho azy mihitsy izany
But he was a man, he had to be.	lehilahy anefa izy tsy maintsy ho izy
There is no more good and evil.	tsy misy intsony ny tsara sy ny ratsy
They are very different.	samy hafa be izy ireo
To someone like me.	aminny olona toa ahy
You have to do it for me.	tsy maintsy manao izany ho ahy ianao
I really enjoyed it.	tena nahafinaritra ahy ilay izy
The car looks simple.	toa tsotra ny fiara
I saw him start to see me.	hitako nanomboka nahita ahy izy
But, in fact, it’s not too far away.	saingy raha ny marina tsy dia lavitra loatra izany
No one knew that.	tsy nisy olona fantany izany
If so, that’s a good idea.	raha izany no izy dia hevitra tsara izany
It needs everyone.	mila ny rehetra izany

This one is really crazy.	tena adala tokoa ity iray ity

They look like me.	toa ahy ireo
But they don’t have to be too sure.	saingy tsy tokony ho azo antoka loatra izy ireo

I saw a lot.	betsaka no hitako
There is room for two.	misy toerana ho anny roa
But he had to be honest with her.	tsy maintsy nanao ny marina taminy anefa izy
He didn't want to be good.	tsy te ho tsara izy
But he was also small.	kely koa anefa izy
He loves time alone.	tiany irery ny fotoana

Not once.	tsy indray mandeha
It’s only one thing.	zavatra iray ihany izany

He was able to walk well.	afaka nandeha tsara izy
That's good for you.	tsara aminao izany
Or not, often.	na tsia matetika
It may be just the closest.	mety ho ny akaiky ihany
But then again, right now we are obviously wrong.	saingy indray aminizao fotoana izao dia mazava ho azy fa diso isika
No one was there.	tsy nisy nahita tao
And they are only the first.	ary izy ireo ihany no voalohany
I will be there.	ho avy eo aho
Of course only one person.	mazava ho azy fa olona iray ihany
Now everyone is for themselves.	ankehitriny dia ho anny tenany ny tsirairay
Otherwise, there will be no game at all.	raha tsy izany dia tsy hisy lalao mihitsy
It works fine now.	miasa tsara izao
Some of these things are different from others.	ny sasany aminireo zavatra ireo dia tsy mitovy aminny hafa
Other parts of it were fun, too.	nahafinaritra koa ny ampahany hafa taminy
This is a process.	dingana ity
It was like three men.	toy ny lehilahy telo ilay izy
Too many words.	be loatra ny teny
Ka eto ?.	ka eto
He was almost gone.	saika lasa izy
And for no reason whatsoever.	ary tsy misy antony na inona na inona
And the world will be better than that.	ary ho tsara kokoa noho izany izao tontolo izao
I don't deserve it.	tsy mendrika izany aho

The first three years were fun.	nahafinaritra ny telo taona voalohany
I saw both.	samy nahita aho
And he knows about me.	ary fantany ny momba ahy
You already have everything in it.	efa manana ny zavadrehetra ao ianao
He goes faster, and faster.	lasa haingana kokoa izy ary haingana kokoa
But that is not the way.	tsy izany anefa no lalana
They went hard, as usual.	nandeha mafy izy ireo toy ny mahazatra
I am very beautiful.	tena tsara tarehy aho
It has to be so, because that’s what’s so obvious.	tsy maintsy ho toy izany satria izany no tena hita
Things are so much more than that.	mihoatra lavitra hatrany ny zavatra
Maybe it started before.	angamba efa nanomboka teo aloha
But he was surely a fool.	azo antoka anefa fa adala izy
He didn't even think about it.	tsy nieritreritra akory izy
He didn't even like the word.	tsy tiany akory ilay teny
It seems simple.	toa tsotra izany
I looked really good.	tena nijery tsara aho
They are good men.	izy ireo no lehilahy tsara
We will never do that.	tsy hanao izany mihitsy izahay
It’s not too bad.	tsy dia ratsy loatra izany
There is still a lot of great work to be done.	mbola betsaka ny asa lehibe
And it’s too easy to make the wrong choice.	ary mora loatra ny manao safidy diso
The world seems to love them.	toa tia azy ireo izao tontolo izao
It’s not theirs at all.	tsy azy ireo mihitsy izany
That is not the question.	tsy izany no fanontaniana
Not to me not you.	tsy amiko tsy ianao
I never went alone.	tsy nandeha irery mihitsy aho
In fact, it’s still a lot.	raha ny marina dia mbola betsaka ihany izany
And he, of course.	ary izy mazava ho azy
A little simple maybe, but not silly.	somary tsotra angamba fa tsy adala
Now that doesn’t make sense.	ankehitriny dia tsy misy dikany izany
Yes, we are tough.	eny mafy izahay
You will lose your job.	ho very asa ianao
It was always there, no one was there at all.	tany foana izao tsy nisy olona teo mihitsy
It’s a wonderful place.	toerana mahafinaritra izy io
If someone doesn’t like me, fine.	raha misy tsy tia ahy dia tsara
It just can’t be done.	tsy azo atao fotsiny izany
Everything will be lost.	ho very daholo ny rehetra
Of course, you’re never sure.	mazava ho azy fa tsy azonao antoka mihitsy
However, there can be nothing wrong.	na izany aza dia mety ho tsy misy diso
We are more vulnerable to evil than to good.	mora kokoa aminny ratsy isika noho ny aminny zavatra tsara
Or something trivial.	na zavatra tsy misy dikany
And there should be.	ary tokony hisy
Not just a game.	tsy lalao fotsiny
They can be very different.	mety ho samy hafa be izy ireo
So, you have to start now.	noho izany tsy maintsy manomboka izao ianao
It doesn’t seem to matter at all.	toa tsy misy dikany na inona na inona
Yes, it was tough.	eny mafy ilay izy
It will never be like that again.	tsy hisy toy izany intsony

I usually work alone.	matetika aho no miasa irery
I finally went.	nandeha ihany aho taminny farany
The biggest.	ny lehibe indrindra
I stayed on the ground.	nijanona teo aminny tany aho
They are already here and that is enough.	efa eto izy ireo ary ampy izay
Nothing close.	tsy misy akaiky
And because we didn’t have a place.	ary satria tsy nanana toerana izahay
But there was something else.	nisy zavatra hafa koa anefa tao
It’s all from the future.	avy aminny ho avy daholo izany
We thank you !.	misaotra anao izahay
It could very well be that.	mety ho izay tokoa
Now he is free again.	afaka indray izy izao
A small part.	ampahany kely
There is no point in it.	tsy misy hevitra ao
That's wrong.	izay no tsy mety
And by all means you might need someone.	ary aminny fomba rehetra mety mila olona ianao
Such a beautiful woman, already in life.	vehivavy tsara tarehy toy izany efa teo aminny fiainana
Everything is simple and functional.	tsotra sy miasa ny zavadrehetra

To me, too much work.	amiko asa be loatra
We walk a little.	mandeha kely izahay
I love everything.	tiako ny zavadrehetra

The road is always a bit steep.	somary foana ny lalana
You can’t have too much or become too hard.	tsy afaka manana be loatra ianao na lasa sarotra loatra

But nothing could be done.	tsy nisy azo natao anefa
But the car was already moving.	efa nandeha anefa ilay fiara
See where they are now.	jereo ny misy azy ireo ankehitriny
Nice to see you again.	faly mahita anao indray
The food was very cheap and good.	tena mora ary tsara ny sakafo
He has no job.	tsy manana asa izy
They are just not the same as you.	tsy mitovy aminny anao fotsiny izy ireo
They got it, others didn’t.	nahazo izy ireo ny hafa tsy nahazo
However, it remained the same.	na izany aza dia nijanona ihany
You are human.	olona ianao
He loves you but.	tia anao izy fa
It may be true that nothing could be done.	marina angamba fa tsy nisy azo natao
It’s just that simple.	tsotra ihany izany
I could no longer tell him.	tsy afaka nilaza taminy intsony aho
It's not very good.	tsy dia tsara loatra ilay izy
You never really love him.	tsy tena tia azy mihitsy ianao
It also works really well.	tena miasa tsara koa izy io
She might love him in a big way.	mety ho tia azy aminny fomba lehibe izy
Because they will, they know.	satria hanao izany izy ireo dia fantany
I know where I am.	fantatro ny toerana misy ahy
But in the end the choice is mine.	fa ny farany dia ahy ny safidy
Sometimes they are with me, sometimes not walking.	indraindray izy ireo miaraka amiko indraindray tsy mandeha
But there you are.	fa eo ianao
And no, it doesn’t make sense.	ary tsia tsy misy dikany izany

There is no dead place.	tsy misy toerana maty
Maybe that’s it.	angamba izany ihany

We have to get there now.	tsy maintsy tonga any isika izao
Did it but lost.	nanao izany saingy very

It was new to him.	vaovao taminy izany
It just didn’t do anything.	tsy nanao na inona na inona fotsiny
But just to watch.	fa ny mijery fotsiny

I saw the big picture.	hitako ny sary lehibe
Maybe there are two things wrong with them.	angamba misy zavatra roa tsy mety aminizy ireo
This movement is already underway.	efa mandeha izany hetsika izany
But the real work won’t come right away.	saingy tsy ho tonga eo no ho eo ny tena asa
And a little impossible.	ary kely tsy azo atao
One worth it.	iray mendrika aminizany

He will do all this.	izy no hanao izany rehetra izany
They fit well.	mety tsara izy ireo
But this is the problem.	fa izao no olana

The food used to be really bad.	tena ratsy ny sakafo teo aloha
You have to make a choice.	tsy maintsy manao safidy ianao
I couldn’t have thought like that.	tsy afaka nieritreritra toy izany aho
That’s what he prefers.	izany no tiany kokoa
Really kind of me.	tena karazana ahy
Not for a reason.	tsy noho ny antony
This is the fun part.	izao no ampahany mahafinaritra
If only people would be really good.	raha mba ho tena tsara tokoa ny olona
And they deserve it.	ary mendrika izany izy ireo

That’s a far better idea.	hevitra tsara lavitra izany
Very happy about it.	tena faly be momba izany
When he dies.	rehefa maty izy
I think that’s very unusual.	heveriko fa tena tsy mahazatra izany

But there, maybe it suits him.	saingy any angamba mety aminy izany
But we can be wrong.	mety ho diso anefa isika
In any case, he is doing the wrong thing.	na izany na tsy izany izy no manao ny tsy marina
I hope you don’t have to do that anymore.	manantena aho fa tsy mila manao izany intsony ianao
It becomes too big to be an idea.	lasa lehibe loatra izany ho hevitra
But it still doesn’t work.	saingy mbola tsy miasa
Maybe things aren’t so different here.	angamba tsy dia hafa loatra ny zavatra eto
He then died.	maty izy avy eo

He’s three, and he’s starting to get it.	telo izy ary manomboka mahazo izany

The procedure is as follows.	ny fomba dia toy izao manaraka izao
It comes in two words.	tonga aminny teny roa izany
That's all for today.	izay ihany ny anio
But the results are different.	tsy mitovy anefa ny vokatra azo

Not too hard.	tsy mafy loatra
Check it out this year.	jereo izy aminity taona ity

It's not a bad thing to do.	tsy ratsy ny atao
And it’s not too much.	ary tsy dia be loatra izany

There is a story about this man.	misy tantara momba ity lehilahy ity
That might be enough.	mety ho ampy izay

They always look beautiful, too.	toa tsara tarehy foana koa izy ireo
Certainly not the last.	azo antoka fa tsy ny farany

Nice to see.	mahafinaritra ny mahita
If not, you will.	raha tsy izany dia hanao izany ianao

It is not an option.	tsy safidy izany
But it may not be too difficult here.	mety tsy ho sarotra be anefa izany eto
He sees clearly.	izy no mahita mazava
Last year was better.	tsara kokoa ny taona lasa
Then they looked.	dia nijery izy ireo
No games.	tsy misy lalao

That should be enough for you.	tokony ho ampy ho anao izany

It’s a completely different job.	asa hafa tanteraka izany
They have been thinking about the past.	efa nieritreritra taminny fotoana lasa izy ireo
Personally, it doesn’t make sense to me.	amiko manokana dia tsy misy dikany amiko izany
That was the reality of him.	izany no tena zavamisy taminy
Nothing is certain.	tsy misy azo antoka
I can't see anything.	tsy afaka mijery zavatra
They were almost gone.	efa saika lasa izy ireo
They seem different.	toa samy hafa izy ireo

These things are great.	lehibe ireo zavatra ireo
But that can be silly.	mety ho adala anefa izany
This is where it will be.	eto no hisy azy
Food and also very, very good.	sakafo ary koa tena tena tsara
There was nothing wrong with that.	tsy nisy na inona na inona taminizany
But in fact, this is not true.	saingy raha ny marina dia tsy marina izany
One is bad, the other can be wrong for him.	ny iray dia ratsy ny iray dia mety ho diso ho azy
But, yes, a personal idea.	saingy eny hevitra manokana

It starts with the first step.	manomboka aminny dingana voalohany izany
We take the first step.	manao ny dingana voalohany izahay
You already told me that.	efa nilaza izany tamiko ianao
That's all I have.	izay ihany no ahy
Everything was easy to do.	mora natao ny zavadrehetra
Here is one of the products.	ity ny iray aminireo vokatra
It’s nothing else for me anymore.	tsy zavatra hafa amiko intsony izany
He just looked at her and was lost.	nijery azy fotsiny izy dia very
Just the night.	ny alina fotsiny
The end is near, he said.	efa akaiky ny farany hoy izy
Now, here’s to the future.	ankehitriny eto izany ho avy izany
People are never the same.	tsy mitovy mihitsy ny olona
It's just like the last time.	toy ny taminny fotoana farany mihitsy izany
In fact, it’s not as good as the other two.	raha ny marina dia tsy tsara toy ny roa hafa izany
He is not far from wrong.	tsy lavitra ny diso izy
There are many people close to us.	betsaka ny olona akaiky antsika
But that’s not the case either.	saingy tsy izany ihany koa

Of course they are.	mazava ho azy fa azy ireo
It’s become a lot of fun.	lasa be dia be izany

And these questions are also wrong.	ary tsy mety koa ireo fanontaniana ireo

It’s well worth it.	tena mendrika izany
Because right now everything is going well.	satria aminizao fotoana izao dia mandeha ny zavadrehetra
He is with them.	miaraka aminizy ireo izy
No, thank you.	tsia misaotra
Just a question.	fanontaniana fotsiny
Women love you.	vehivavy tia anao
I must disagree with you there.	tsy maintsy tsy mitovy hevitra aminao aho any
The man in this game has to be a man.	ny lehilahy aminity lalao ity dia tsy maintsy lehilahy
It looks the same to me.	toa mitovy amiko izy io
But he is much more than that.	mihoatra lavitra noho izany anefa izy
Often the truth.	matetika ny marina
Yes, just did it.	eny nanao izany fotsiny
One is not superior to the other.	tsy ambony noho ny iray ny iray
In fact, nothing else works.	raha ny marina tsy misy zavatra hafa miasa
The word was there again.	teo indray io teny io
I love them.	tiako izy ireo
Maybe we haven’t looked too closely.	angamba isika mbola tsy nijery tsara
Everyone loves them.	samy tia azy ireo ny rehetra
I still need something else.	mbola mila zavatra hafa koa aho
You just have to look at it.	mila mijery azy fotsiny ianao
And there were these things.	ary nisy ireo zavatra ireo
It’s more than a job for him.	mihoatra noho ny asa ho azy izany
I have to disagree.	tsy maintsy tsy mitovy hevitra aho
We have never had a problem.	mbola tsy nisy olana mihitsy izahay

Nothing was fun or easy about it.	tsy nisy zavatra nahafinaritra na mora taminizany
I never thought it would be so difficult.	tsy nieritreritra mihitsy aho hoe ho sarotra be izany

She was just a simple woman, like everyone else.	vehivavy tsotra fotsiny izy toy ny hafa rehetra
I have a lot.	be dia be aho
But that did not go away immediately.	tsy nandeha avy hatrany anefa izany
In fact, this is not a bad idea.	raha ny marina dia tsy hevitra ratsy izany
This is always possible.	azo atao foana izany
There is so much to life.	be dia be ny fiainana
More than usual, however.	mihoatra noho ny mahazatra na izany aza
I think he’s better than that.	heveriko fa tsara noho izany izy
It went well.	nandeha tsara ilay izy
But there are a lot of jobs and other activities as well.	fa maro ny asa sy ny asa hafa koa
In fact often it is not.	raha ny marina matetika dia tsy izany
The first option is to do nothing.	ny safidy voalohany dia ny tsy hanao na inona na inona
I hope he is in a better place than this.	manantena aho fa any aminny toerana tsara kokoa noho ity izy
It made sense, in a way.	nisy dikany izany taminny fomba iray
I am a busy man.	lehilahy be atao aho
That’s a solid guarantee.	izany dia antoka mafy
It is, of course, more so than now.	dia mazava ho azy fa mihoatra noho ny ankehitriny
The war itself is only for men.	ny ady mihitsy dia noho ny lehilahy ihany
It's not okay either.	tsy mety koa

He is free of himself.	afaka ny tenany izy
He did a great work for us.	nanao asa lehibe ho antsika izy
They are great for all of you.	tena tsara ho anao rehetra izy ireo
I find the news not good.	hitako fa tsy tsara ilay vaovao
How and when.	ny fomba sy ny fotoana
The picture was fun and enjoyable.	nahafinaritra sy nahafinaritra ilay sary
I think it’s still somewhere.	heveriko fa mbola any aminny toerana iray
Then it was gone.	dia lasa ilay izy
Or they don’t like me.	na koa tsy tia ahy izy ireo
Nowadays, however, women can have a more equal role.	aminizao fotoana izao anefa ny vehivavy dia afaka manana toerana mitovy kokoa
There must always be a new path.	tsy maintsy misy lalana vaovao foana
It makes more sense when we are together.	misy dikany kokoa raha miaraka isika
I also had them in the previous car.	nanana azy ireo taminny fiara teo aloha ihany koa
They may have gone in different directions now.	mety ho nandeha taminny lalana samy hafa izy ireo ankehitriny

Others are just wrong.	ny hafa dia diso hevitra fotsiny
i love you	tiako aho
Must see the top !.	tsy maintsy mahita ny ambony indrindra
But very easy.	fa tena mora
But it's not because of you.	tsy noho ianao anefa izany
Many died, and died hard.	maro no maty ary maty mafy
Maybe it will be the same now.	angamba ho toy izany koa izao
He is not very good.	tsy dia tsara loatra izy
Three years ago.	telo taona lasa
And you are so wrong.	ary diso hevitra be ianao
Because I think it doesn’t exist.	satria heveriko fa tsy misy izany
The car is the hardest.	sarotra indrindra ny fiara

I really enjoyed it.	tena nahafinaritra ahy
It has come a long way.	efa lavitra lavitra

No one was there.	tsy nisy olona tao
It’s a pretty little thing, too.	zavatra kely tsara tarehy izy koa
It's not too far.	tsy dia lavitra izany
I had a different world.	nanana tontolo hafa aho
Real work.	asa tena izy
But they are all the same.	mitovy anefa izy rehetra
That’s one of the good things about people like me.	iray aminireo zavatra tsara momba ny olona toa ahy izany
That’s good, because it can’t.	tsara izany satria tsy afaka
However, they are not free from the problem.	na izany aza tsy afaka aminny olana izy ireo
We can be really bad some nights.	mety ho tena ratsy tokoa isika aminny alina sasany
But it really is.	fa tena izy tokoa
He did well himself.	nanao tsara ny tenany izy
The same two.	ireo roa ihany
It was not a pleasant conversation.	tsy resaka nahafinaritra ilay izy
About me and you.	momba ahy sy ianao
Everyone is so beautiful.	tena tsara tarehy ny olona rehetra
I'm still watching him now.	mbola mijery azy aho izao
But look better.	fa jereo tsara kokoa
But you have so much more than that.	saingy manana mihoatra lavitra noho izany ianao
Now he’s just grown up.	ankehitriny dia lehibe fotsiny izy
In general, this is possible.	aminny ankapobeny dia azo atao izany
They may be gone.	mety ho lasa izy ireo
Of course, that makes good sense.	mazava ho azy fa misy dikany tsara izany
One day, but not now.	indray andro any fa tsy izao
It is the same.	iray ihany izy io
Of course, this is absolutely unnecessary.	mazava ho azy fa tena tsy ilaina izany
Although it doesn’t seem to work that way at all.	na dia toa tsy miasa toy izany mihitsy aza

We do a good job at first.	manao ny asa tsara izahay aminny voalohany
It’s not meant to be history.	tsy natao ho tantara izany
It was a bad day.	andro ratsy izany
This is not a big deal.	tsy olana lehibe izany
We have no idea at all.	tsy manana hevitra mihitsy izahay
Because we are not alone.	satria tsy irery isika
And everything will be better.	ary ho tsara kokoa ny zavadrehetra
No, he couldn't do that.	tsia tsy afaka nanao izany izy
Unless, of course, you had.	raha tsy hoe mazava ho azy dia nanana
Simple work.	asa tsotra
We need a reason.	mila antony izahay
It seems that the end is near.	toa efa akaiky ny farany izy
Because he wanted the best for me.	satria tiany ny tsara indrindra ho ahy
Not the fastest, but more than the fastest.	tsy ny haingana indrindra fa mihoatra noho ny haingana
Well, soon.	eny ary tsy ho ela
It was very difficult.	tena sarotra ilay izy
If you don’t, you’re bound to lose it all.	raha tsy manao izany ianao dia tsy maintsy ho very izany rehetra izany
All of them.	izy rehetra ireo
But you know we’re all great here.	saingy fantatrao fa isika rehetra dia lehibe eto
No, worse than that.	tsia ratsy noho izany
It’s bad to start doing that.	ratsy ny manomboka manao izany
No no, no yes.	tsy tsia tsy eny

Apparently not.	toa tsy izy
The same game.	ny lalao mitovy

I don’t know if that’s the case.	tsy fantatro raha izany no izy

They will be different from themselves from now on.	ho hafa noho ny tenany izy ireo manomboka izao
He can't have you.	tsy afaka manana anao izy
It looks better.	toa tsara kokoa izany
Like one day it will be available again.	toy ny indray andro any dia ho azo indray
This is completely misleading.	tena diso hevitra tanteraka izany
But she has been like that for a long time.	efa ela anefa izy no lasa toy izany
But they are all good.	saingy tsara daholo izy ireo
It may be high or it may be low.	mety ho ambony na mety ho ambany
The first is a lot.	betsaka ny voalohany
Pretty good maybe.	somary tsara angamba
It's like you're not here.	toy ny hoe tsy eto ianao
For some reason, no one.	noho ny antony sasany dia tsy nisy olona
Of course, he did nothing wrong.	mazava ho azy fa tsy nanao ratsy izy
It came.	tonga izany
Not so, but it could be.	tsy izany fa mety ho izy koa
I'm dead.	efa maty aho
And that is not the case here.	ary tsy izany no zavamisy eto
Some, though, aren’t.	ny sasany na dia tsy izany aza
They should have done it.	tokony ho nanao izany izy ireo
I really have a problem with that.	tena manana olana aminizany aho
There seemed to be no one.	toa tsy nisy olona
But more than anything, she just loved the man.	fa mihoatra noho ny zavadrehetra dia tiany fotsiny ilay lehilahy
Or maybe he just arrived.	na angamba vao tonga izy
They all looked at me.	nijery ahy izy rehetra
Even though they hadn’t done it before, they knew now.	na dia tsy nanao izany aza izy ireo teo aloha dia fantany izao
I think we both do.	heveriko fa samy manao izany isika
You came too.	tonga koa ianao
We are with you !.	miaraka aminao izahay
It’s definitely simpler.	azo antoka fa tsotra kokoa izany
They shouldn’t make sense.	tsy tokony hisy dikany izy ireo
Some meanings are very specific.	ny dikany sasany dia tena manokana
But you had to do it.	tsy maintsy nanao izany anefa ianao
Sometimes both do.	indraindray dia samy manao izany
Someone is really nice.	tena mahafinaritra ny olona iray
I got the last question.	nahazo ny fanontaniana farany aho
He’s too big for that, of course.	lehibe loatra izy noho izany mazava loatra
No more, of course.	tsy misy intsony mazava ho azy
All of these words are easy, of course.	ireo teny rehetra ireo dia mora mazava ho azy
You can’t have one without the other.	tsy afaka manana iray ianao raha tsy misy ilay iray
But that is not the main thing.	tsy izay anefa no tena zavadehibe
I simply know that you are.	fantatro tsotra izao fa ianao
This is crazy.	adala izao
Not at all.	tsia aminizany
He is not of this world.	tsy eto aminity tontolo ity izy
Maybe more than that.	angamba mihoatra izany
But without money, they can’t do it.	saingy raha tsy misy vola dia tsy afaka manao izany izy ireo
A woman could tell.	afaka nilaza ny vehivavy iray
But he knows that it makes more sense.	fantany anefa fa misy dikany kokoa izany
But he often did.	matetika anefa izy no nanao izany
He liked the idea.	nahafinaritra azy ilay hevitra
I don’t want to be without you.	tsy te ho tsy misy anao aho
However, many are the same.	na izany aza dia maro ny mitovy
There may or may not be.	mety misy na mety tsy hisy
You will be lost.	ho very ianao
That should be enough.	tena tokony ho ampy izay
That was the kind of time it was.	izany no karazana fotoana taminizany
I have one.	manana iray aho
He did not stop there.	tsy nijanona teo izy
But that is not what it is.	tsy izay anefa ilay izy

Small things, big things.	zavatra kely zavatra lehibe
They are good and everything is good.	tsara izy ireo ary tsara ny zavadrehetra
There may be.	misy angamba

Better than everyone else.	tsara noho ny anny rehetra
But it’s in it.	fa ao anatiny izany

Did it again.	nanao izany indray
They just don’t walk.	tsy mandeha fotsiny izy ireo
There is more to life than money.	misy zavadehibe kokoa eo aminny fiainana noho ny vola

As well as .	ary koa
It doesn't seem to work anymore.	toa tsy miasa intsony
I will come.	ho avy aho
She didn’t love him and never had it.	tsy tia azy izy ary tsy nanana izany mihitsy
Other amounts are not appropriate.	ny vola hafa dia tsy mety
But the worst has yet to come.	saingy mbola tsy tonga ny ratsy indrindra
Great ideas are good ideas.	hevitra lehibe dia hevitra tsara
And there was a trip one day.	ary nisy ny dia indray andro
That is the important thing.	izay no zavadehibe
He hadn't seen her yet.	mbola tsy nahita azy izy
Maybe it was.	angamba nisy izany
These things are not bad at all.	tsy ratsy mihitsy ireo zavatra ireo
Not that we have money of course.	tsy hoe manana vola izahay mazava ho azy
Everything you need to know.	izay rehetra tokony ho fantatrao
But not everything is so simple.	tsy tsotra toy izany anefa ny zavadrehetra
We disagree again.	tsy mitovy hevitra indray izahay
But this day is a little different.	saingy hafa kely ity andro ity
Finally, here they are.	farany eto izy ireo
I didn’t have any problems.	tsy nanana olana na inona na inona aho
It’s not fun anymore.	tsy mahafinaritra intsony izany
He stayed well.	nijanona tsara izy
And most importantly.	ary ny zavadehibe
The last time was better.	tsara kokoa ny fotoana farany
Not without you.	tsy raha tsy misy anao
We really want to be honest.	te hanao ny marina tokoa izahay
If so, you are wrong.	raha misy dia diso hevitra ianao
Old places and old people.	toerana taloha sy olona taloha
But he never did anything.	saingy tsy nanao na inona na inona mihitsy izy
However, he left.	na izany aza dia lasa izy
You can’t do everything but you can do things.	tsy afaka manao ny zavadrehetra ianao fa afaka manao zavatra
It was a overnight thing.	zavatra indray alina izany
I didn’t have to.	tsy nanana aho
The trip was fun.	nahafinaritra ilay dia
He said it would.	nilaza izy fa hisy izany
And then you need more.	ary avy eo ianao mila bebe kokoa
But this one may be different.	mety ho hafa anefa ity iray ity
He also doesn’t work.	tsy miasa koa izy
You are never sure.	tsy azo antoka mihitsy ianao
We are the same.	mitovy isika
But at the time.	saingy taminizany fotoana izany
You had to do well.	tsy maintsy nanao tsara ianao
It just stopped.	nijanona fotsiny izany
And went.	dia nandeha
The moving car does not start early.	tsy manomboka mandeha aloha ny fiara mandeha
And it doesn’t seem to get better right away.	ary toa tsy ho tsara kokoa avy hatrany izany
It’s almost perfect.	saika tanteraka izany
The story didn’t make sense to me.	tsy nisy dikany tamiko ilay tantara
But it wasn’t done.	saingy tsy natao izany
I was a little happy.	dia faly kely
Overall, he’s glad he didn’t.	aminny ankapobeny faly izy fa tsy nanao izany
Top down.	avy any ambony
You can do it or you can’t.	afaka manao izany ianao na tsy afaka
But I was too much.	be loatra anefa aho
You know a little.	fantatrao ny kely
And another far away.	ary iray hafa lavitra
i'm good anyway.	tsara aho na izany na tsy izany
But they are still tough.	mbola mafy anefa izy ireo
So that's something.	ka zavatra izany
They are so fun.	tena mahafinaritra izy ireo
And for very good reason.	ary aminny antony tena tsara
With you there.	miaraka aminao any
The big one, the small one.	ny iray lehibe ny iray kely
However, there was no further action.	tsy nisy hetsika intsony anefa
It was a difficult task for all of them.	asa sarotra ho azy rehetra izany
We have more work to do.	manana asa lavitra kokoa izahay
I was in another world.	tany aminny tontolo hafa aho
I see the problem.	hitako ilay olana
It only takes a little and not a lot.	mila kely fotsiny fa tsy be dia be
We are here again.	mbola eo indray isika
But then it came to me.	fa avy eo dia tonga amiko izany
Get the idea.	mahazo ny hevitra
And that’s just the beginning.	ary vao manomboka izany
The man is no more.	tsy misy intsony ilay lehilahy
Or they are really bad.	na tena ratsy be izy ireo
Yes, not too fast, but just the hard way.	eny tsy dia haingana loatra fa ny fomba sarotra ihany
Therefore, such an approach is necessary.	noho izany ilaina ny fomba toy izany
He is not alone.	tsy izy irery akory
They are very handsome men.	tena lehilahy tsara tarehy izy ireo
There is no information about his current whereabouts.	tsy misy vaovao momba ny misy azy ankehitriny
Money is not bad.	tsy ny vola no ratsy
He can thank me for that.	afaka misaotra ahy noho izany izy
It didn't seem to make sense anymore.	toa tsy nisy dikany intsony izany
And it's right for you.	ary mety aminao
And if anyone has a problem with that.	ary raha misy olona manana olana aminizany
They just love you.	tia anao fotsiny izy ireo
Just do it all.	ataovy fotsiny izany rehetra izany
He has been doing this for a long time.	efa ela izy no nanao izany
This is really not a stupid question.	tena tsy fanontaniana adala izany
To everyone you can.	aminny olona rehetra azonao atao
There were a lot of places that weren’t there.	betsaka ny toerana tsy nisy
This idea is wrong.	diso hevitra io hevitra io
They did it for themselves.	nanao izany ho anny tenany izy ireo
I hope that will be enough.	manantena aho fa ho ampy izany
He could now do great things for her.	afaka nanao zavatra lehibe ho azy izy izao
I found one.	nahita iray aho
Or maybe he just is.	na angamba izy ihany
Two by two.	roa aminny roa
He really loves her too.	tena tia azy koa izy
You are more than that.	mihoatra noho izany ianao
War is not human.	tsy olona ny ady
Then they stopped.	dia nijanona izy ireo avy eo
I love everything and everything.	tiako ny zavatra rehetra sy ny zavatra rehetra
Now the hard part.	ankehitriny ny ampahany sarotra
And there never will be.	ary tsy hisy mihitsy
Now, nothing goes.	ankehitriny tsy misy mandeha
Nothing mattered anymore.	tsy nisy zavadehibe intsony
He really is.	izy tokoa
Many have gone further.	maro no lasa lavitra kokoa
The last days.	ny andro farany
In general, there may not be.	aminny ankapobeny mety tsy hisy
So he was there.	ka teo izy
But they will never be fulfilled.	tsy ho tanteraka mihitsy anefa izy ireo
He is, but he doesn’t do that.	izy no izy fa tsy mba manao toy izany
But you are the one.	fa ianao no iray
Then it started again.	dia nanomboka indray izany
The next one will be soon.	tsy ho ela ny manaraka
They are real women.	tena vehivavy izy ireo
He started having a lot of fun.	nanomboka nahafinaritra be izy
It will be good for me.	ho tsara ho ahy izany
But we are here together.	saingy miaraka isika eto
Especially since he’s still young.	indrindra fa mbola kely izy
And they will know, well.	ary ho fantany tsara
And at the time.	ary taminizany fotoana izany
He said it wasn’t a thing.	nilaza izy fa tsy zavatra izany

And there you are.	ary eo ianao
I can work now.	afaka miasa aho aminizao fotoana izao

You looked before.	nijery tany aloha ianao
If we all had these problems.	raha samy nanana ireo olana ireo isika rehetra
But if he wants to.	fa raha tiany
And he was free.	ary afaka izy
No, it's two.	tsia roa ilay izy
And that seems to be true.	ary toa marina izany
He might look a little.	mety mijery kely izy
To me, that doesn’t matter.	amiko dia tsy zavadehibe izany
That’s not really what matters.	tsy izany tokoa no zavadehibe
It was like any day.	toy ny andro rehetra izany
Then we do as much as we can.	avy eo dia manao araka izay azo atao izahay
I always look at these things.	mijery ireo zavatra ireo foana aho
She would have been more beautiful without it.	tsara tarehy kokoa izy raha tsy nisy izany
I work for others too.	miasa ho anny hafa koa aho
A day or two.	iray na roa andro
It was as if it had happened.	toy ny nisy izany
Just a really nice picture.	sary mahafinaritra be fotsiny
The reason is there, and the reason is money.	ny antony dia ao ary ny antony dia ny vola
Do as you please.	ataovy araka izay tianao
Yes, a little.	eny kely
They both had none.	tsy nanana izy roa
Whatever she is, she is more beautiful.	na inona na inona izy dia tsara tarehy kokoa
And it was done.	ary tanteraka izany
What you need to know now is important.	zavadehibe ny zavatra tokony ho fantatrao izao
And it was a lot of fun.	ary nahafinaritra be izany
They are never seen.	tsy hita mihitsy izy ireo
Take a look at the big ones.	jereo kely ny lehibe
That is true now.	marina izany ankehitriny
There are many such places.	misy toerana maro toy izany
No one did anything.	tsy nisy nanao na inona na inona
Part of that.	ny ampahany aminizany
You never know about people.	tsy fantatrao mihitsy ny momba ny olona
Everyone has a story.	samy manana tantara ny tsirairay
The question is for some of these things.	ny fanontaniana dia ho anny sasany aminireo zavatra ireo
The future, therefore, was still an issue for me.	ny ho avy noho izany dia mbola olana tamiko
You came last.	tonga farany ianao
They came to do the work and left.	tonga nanao ny asa izy ireo ary lasa nandeha
Men can be three.	ny lehilahy dia mety ho telo
He said they didn’t.	nilaza izy fa tsy nanao izany izy ireo
And that is clear.	ary mazava izany
In fact, they have a lot to lose.	raha ny marina betsaka ny ho very izy ireo
He looked at her quickly.	nijery azy haingana izy
Maybe it’s too much now.	efa tena be loatra angamba izao

Not too difficult.	tsy dia sarotra

We disagree in part.	tsy mitovy hevitra izahay aminny ampahany
I can't find it.	tsy hitako
But you are now.	fa ianao izao
And he’s really good.	ary tena tsara izy
Food at last.	sakafo aminny farany
But it is very important.	tena zavadehibe anefa izany
I’m glad we went.	faly aho fa nandeha izahay
But in fact, not always.	fa raha ny marina dia tsy foana
It could be something else.	mety ho zavatra hafa
So they might have done the same.	araka izany dia mety ho nanao izany ihany izy ireo
Very little was found.	kely be ny zavatra hita
That would not be true.	tsy ho marina izany
But he was there.	teo anefa izy
War cannot be waged without money.	tsy azo atao ny ady raha tsy misy vola

It has always been and always will be.	efa nisy foana izy io ary mbola hisy foana
This is a wonderful time.	fotoana mahafinaritra izao
I don’t do that.	tsy manao toy izany aho
But overall life was good.	saingy taminny ankapobeny dia tsara ny fiainana
There are three ideas.	misy hevitra telo
I shouldn’t have known all that.	tsy tokony ho fantatro izany rehetra izany
Looks like you need one.	toa mila iray ianao
I wasn’t really there.	tsy tena nisy aho
But if they haven’t seen us yet, they’ll be coming soon.	fa raha mbola tsy nahita anay izy ireo dia ho avy tsy ho ela
But, it’s just a picture.	saingy sary fotsiny izany
In fact, no, no.	raha ny marina tsia tsia
I don’t know much about him.	tsy dia fantatro loatra ny momba azy
This is a special land.	tany manokana ity
I’m not very good right now.	tsy dia tsara loatra aho aminizao fotoana izao
It will be difficult at first.	ho sarotra izany aminny voalohany
That's not enough for me.	tsy ampy ahy izany

I'm happier.	faly kokoa aho
Things are big and very small.	ny zavatra dia lehibe ary tena kely
Everything else seems to be going well.	toa mandeha tsara ny zavatra hafa rehetra
Often that can be the case.	matetika dia mety ho toy izany

Sometimes it is not found.	indraindray dia tsy hita
There are too many stories.	be loatra koa ny tantara
So, of course.	noho izany mazava ho azy

Even better, he seems confused.	ny tsara kokoa aza dia toa very hevitra izy

I know that is true.	fantatro fa marina izany
You can have a car.	afaka manana fiara ianao

It was like night and day to me.	toy ny alina sy andro izany tamiko

But sometimes we are too far away.	saingy indraindray isika dia lavitra
There are a lot of nice pictures.	misy sary mahafinaritra be dia be

We usually work here.	matetika izahay no miasa eto
Things are different here.	hafa ny zavatra eto
Just like the news.	toy ny vaovao ihany
That is the least.	izay no kely indrindra
The old people were wrong.	diso hevitra ny olona taloha

Yes, you know that this is always good news.	eny fantatrao fa vaovao tsara foana izany
Then we love food.	dia tia sakafo izahay
There are two games to that fact.	misy lalao roa ny zavamisy aminizany
And in the world around you.	ary aminny tontolo manodidina anao

That could be too much.	mety ho be loatra izany
He did not go.	tsy nandeha izy
I'm glad he's here.	faly aho fa eto izy
And then he wasn’t.	ary avy eo dia tsy izy
We are all very happy for him.	faly be ho azy izahay rehetra
Still, it’s fun.	na izany aza dia mbola mahafinaritra
None of me.	tsy misy amiko
But now something else happened.	nisy zavatra hafa anefa izao
Yes, you can too.	eny azonao atao koa izany
And people seem to love him.	ary toa tia azy ny olona
But we do not agree with him.	tsy mitovy hevitra aminy anefa izahay
It’s just one of the things about him.	iray aminireo zavatra momba azy ihany izany

Do it the wrong way.	ataovy aminny fomba ratsy izy
He told her.	hoy izy taminy
He is now completely full of himself.	feno tanteraka ny tenany izy izao
Time always went by.	nandeha foana ny fotoana
They may be too selfish.	mety ho tia tena loatra izy ireo
Then he was wrong.	taminizany dia diso izy
We have come a long way.	tonga lavitra isika

Not far from me.	tsy lavitra ahy
There are many ways you can do this.	misy fomba maro azonao atao
In the.	tany aminny
No one ever thought to do that.	tsy nisy nieritreritra ny hanao izany mihitsy

The first thing is to get started.	ny zavatra voalohany dia ny manomboka
I really can't thank you.	tena tsy afaka misaotra anao aho
And there should be.	ary tokony hisy izany
He saw something that could be done.	nahita zavatra azo atao izy

And it starts early.	ary manomboka aloha izany
But I see something completely different.	fa mahita zavatra hafa tanteraka
It was really bad.	tena ratsy tokoa ilay izy

Thanks again.	misaotra indray
It’s a natural thing.	zavatra mandeha ho azy izany
Both work well.	samy miasa tsara ireo
They are good too.	tsara koa izy ireo
It just takes a lot of time.	mila fotoana be fotsiny izany

So there may be less significant results.	noho izany dia mety hisy vokatra tsy dia misy dikany loatra
There is nothing else in it.	tsy misy zavatra hafa ao
However, on the day.	na izany aza aminny andro
He couldn't do that to her.	tsy afaka nanao izany taminy izy
He had to do something about it.	tsy maintsy nanao zavatra momba izany izy
You don’t have to look at me too much.	tsy mila mijery ahy loatra ianao
We are all confused.	very hevitra isika rehetra
I saw him then.	hitako izy avy eo
Thank you though.	misaotra anao anefa na izany aza
They die one by one.	maty tsirairay izy ireo
Yes, you can walk around everyone.	eny afaka mandeha manodidina ny olona rehetra ianao
Yes, fun.	eny mahafinaritra
They were in an insignificant place.	tao aminny toerana tsy misy dikany izy ireo
It’s just a matter of time.	fotoana fotsiny izany
And see that too.	ary jereo koa izany
He is the same.	izy dia iray ihany
The place looks good inside.	toa tsara ny ao anatiny ilay toerana
But this is also not true.	tsy marina koa anefa izany

He usually is.	matetika izy no

I always did that when I was little.	nanao izany foana aho taminny mbola kely
But not far away.	saingy tsy lavitra
In the good old days.	taminny andro tsara taloha
More than life itself.	mihoatra noho ny fiainana mihitsy
Not now, maybe not again.	tsy izao mety tsy indray
You now have two options.	manana safidy roa ianao aminizao fotoana izao
The world seems so close.	toa akaiky tokoa izao tontolo izao
I am happy for them.	faly ho azy ireo aho
Yes, good, good.	eny tsara tsara
There was a car there now.	nisy fiara teo izao
It’s like work now.	toy ny asa izao
That's all he needs to know.	izay ihany no tokony ho fantany
The universe is like this.	toy izao izao rehetra izao
It is even more important.	mbola zavadehibe kokoa noho izany aza izy io
Lots below, actually.	be dia be eto ambany raha ny marina
And he always seemed to see it.	ary toa nahita izany hatrany
This is the good one.	izao ilay tsara
He was the last one there.	izy no farany tao
One night.	indray alina
And they both seem to do it.	ary toa samy nanao izany izy
And not just from him.	ary tsy avy aminy ihany
Probably right away.	mety avy hatrany
This is where I was.	io no toerana nisy ahy
There was no world.	tsy nisy izao tontolo izao
There was nothing nearby.	tsy nisy na inona na inona teo akaiky teo
Of course, it all got to him.	mazava ho azy fa nahazo azy daholo izany rehetra izany
Soon it will be no more.	tsy ho ela dia tsy hisy intsony izany
We have never seen him again.	mbola tsy nahita azy indray izahay
That’s a really cool idea.	hevitra tena mahafinaritra izany
I don't see any problem there.	tsy hitako izay olana ao
To everyone.	aminny olona rehetra
Then, we had an idea.	avy eo nanana hevitra izahay
It will be harder to come by.	ho sarotra kokoa ny ho tonga
But of course not.	mazava ho azy anefa fa tsy izy
It may or may not be.	mety ho izany na tsia
But he never did.	tsy nanao izany mihitsy anefa izy
This is the kind of game we have right now.	io no karazana lalao misy antsika aminizao fotoana izao
You will be happy with it.	ho faly aminizany ianao
No one is real.	tsy misy olona tena izy
You have already told me about yourself.	efa nilaza tamiko ny momba anao ianao
And these people will do well.	ary ireo olona ireo dia hanao tsara
It will never be like that again.	tsy ho toy izany intsony
But it’s not just the car doesn’t work.	fa tsy ny fiara tsy miasa fotsiny
This idea is misplaced.	diso toerana io hevitra io
He knew what was there.	fantany izay tao
They had nothing on me.	tsy nanana na inona na inona tamiko izy ireo
It may indeed be.	mety ho izany tokoa
He knew he was good.	fantany fa tsara izy
You need something from me.	mila zavatra amiko ianao
Either way, there is a place.	na izany na tsy izany misy toerana
But the whole idea is crazy.	saingy ny hevitra rehetra dia adala
They love women, and women love them.	tia ny vehivavy izy ireo ary tia azy ireo vehivavy
I don't think so.	heveriko fa tsy izy
They also need money.	mila vola koa izy ireo
We all do that.	samy manao izany isika rehetra
And then, he told me one day.	ary avy eo nilaza tamiko izy indray andro
They also said.	hoy koa izy ireo
Not so now.	tsy toy izany aminizao fotoana izao
It was very special to him.	tena manokana taminy izany
This is especially true for women.	marina indrindra izany ho anny vehivavy
But this year is different.	hafa anefa ity taona ity
I find myself doing this all the time.	hitako manao anio foana
The unprecedented.	ny tsy mbola nisy
But this one is different.	hafa anefa ity iray ity
She is a good woman, yes.	vehivavy tsara izy eny
He is there with you.	eo miaraka aminao izy
Of course it can.	mazava ho azy fa afaka izany
Even if he is far away.	na dia lavitra aza izy
Or maybe not.	na angamba tsy izany
Surely it is the same.	azo antoka fa iray ihany izany
If always a large part, i.	raha foana ny ampahany betsaka i
Yes, it’s really fun.	eny tena mahafinaritra izany
I had to see.	tsy maintsy nahita aho
This person is already with you.	efa miaraka aminao io olona io
But as the years go by.	saingy rehefa mandeha ny taona
It’s just a matter of time.	resaka fotoana fotsiny izany
I need an idea here.	mila hevitra eto aho
Not a day goes by.	tsy tonga indray andro
Although we didn’t see anything wrong.	na dia tsy nahita zavatra ratsy aza izahay
So this is not a trivial question.	ka tsy fanontaniana tsy misy dikany izany
The trip was great.	tena tsara ilay dia
He had to go alone.	tsy maintsy nandeha irery izy
These things are good.	tsara ireo zavatra ireo
He should be happy.	tokony ho faly izy
Because the world is working properly.	satria izao tontolo izao dia miasa araka ny tokony ho izy
So that's why it doesn't work anymore.	ka izay no tsy mandeha intsony
He is gone himself.	lasa ny tenany
You come up with a good story.	tonga miaraka aminny tantara tsara ianao
He may have been there.	mety ho teo izy
The upper one while the lower one.	ny iray ambony raha ambany ny iray
More than that.	mihoatra azy io
You can’t do that to them.	tsy azonao atao aminizy ireo izany
They can't.	tsy afaka izy ireo
I can't look.	tsy mety mijery aho
But that’s not the most important thing right now.	saingy tsy izany no zavadehibe indrindra aminizao fotoana izao
Money is neither good nor bad.	tsy tsara na ratsy ny vola
Just men.	lehilahy fotsiny
He knows the way well.	fantany tsara ny lalana
But no one seems to be doing that.	toa tsy misy manao izany anefa
He may have been wrong there.	mety ho diso izy teo
But he went anyway.	nandeha ihany anefa izy
He didn’t know if he was right or not.	tsy fantany na marina izy na tsia
they used to say.	hoy izy ireo taloha
There are two reasons for this fact.	misy antony roa izany zavamisy izany
I was on the ground.	teo aminny tany aho
So he didn't.	ka tsy nanao izany izy
It's been two days.	roa andro izany
The problem is, everything seems normal.	ny olana dia toa mahazatra ny zavadrehetra
They are not here or there.	tsy eto na any izy ireo
We will not.	tsy ho isika
He does it for everyone.	manao izany aminny olona rehetra izy
Went there.	nandeha tany
In spite of everything, he loves us.	na dia eo aza ny zavadrehetra dia tia antsika izy
She was happy at first.	faly izy taminny voalohany
This is the most obvious.	izany no tena hita
I have many.	manana maro aho
These are the only good men.	ireo ihany no lehilahy tsara
He made a lot of money.	nahazo vola be izy
We have a bigger one.	manana iray lehibe kokoa isika
Maybe it’s endless.	angamba tsy misy farany izany
I am here now.	tonga aho izao
It had no bottom.	tsy nisy ambany izy io
Now it’s very special.	ankehitriny dia tena manokana
He never saw her again.	tsy nahita azy intsony izy
And lots of good food.	ary sakafo tsara be dia be
She seems like a strong and pleasant woman.	toa vehivavy mafy sy mahafinaritra izy
I could have done something better.	afaka nanao zavatra tsara kokoa aho
The idea is certainly not new.	azo antoka fa tsy vaovao ilay hevitra
It wasn’t that he had no idea.	tsy hoe tsy nanana hevitra izy
Do what you enjoy.	ataovy izay mahafinaritra anao
But it will not be easy.	tsy ho mora anefa izany
I am the same as everyone else.	mitovy aminny hafa aho
She is very happy.	tena faly be izy
It needs us.	mila antsika izany
He’s bad, really bad.	ratsy izy tena ratsy
However, this is no longer true.	tsy marina intsony anefa izany raha ny zavamisy ankehitriny
However, this is a big step.	na izany aza dia dingana lehibe izany
Of course, he was happy.	mazava ho azy fa faly izy
He is right.	marina izy
So it may not be.	ka mety tsy izy
No problem, found.	tsy misy olana hita
Maybe he’s dead, like him.	angamba izy efa maty toa azy
He is the best.	izy no tena tsara indrindra
But now he must be selfish.	tsy maintsy tia tena anefa izy izao
In word and deed.	na aminny teny na aminny atao
There always is and always will be.	misy foana ary mbola hisy foana
He could have become a better person.	mety ho lasa olona tsara kokoa izy
He is very good to us.	tena tsara ho antsika izy
And at that point we are.	ary aminizany fotoana izany isika
They are already here.	efa eto izy ireo
However, it is better than nothing.	na izany aza tsara kokoa noho ny tsy misy
Usually all three.	matetika izy telo
And no, not you.	ary tsia tsy ianao
I've seen him.	efa hitako izy
Not every first time is good.	tsy ny fotoana voalohany rehetra dia tsara
It was not necessary.	tsy nila izany
And it’s nice to see that.	ary mahafinaritra ny mahita izany
And the biggest issue at the time was money.	ary ny olana lehibe indrindra taminizany fotoana izany dia ny vola
The money is gone.	lasa ny vola
Then the choice is his.	avy eo dia azy ny safidy
Or all at once !.	na izy rehetra indray mandeha
You can’t do anything special.	tsy afaka manao zavatra manokana ianao
It seems like a good step.	toa dingana tsara izany
This is not new.	tsy vaovao izany
They are no more.	tsy misy intsony izy ireo
Of course, that may not be the case.	mazava ho azy fa mety tsy ho izany
Of course she’s crazy, but still beautiful.	mazava ho azy fa adala izy saingy tsara tarehy ihany
That’s the only thing that doesn’t work.	izay ihany no tsy mandeha
He said something very nice.	nilaza zavatra tena tsara izy
But that’s the real reason to be sure.	fa izany no tena antony tokony ho azo antoka
He said they were his favorite when he grew up.	nilaza izy fa izy ireo no tiany indrindra rehefa lehibe
From no.	avy aminny no
About us, though.	momba antsika na izany aza
Nothing like this has ever happened before.	mbola tsy nisy toy izany
It has to.	tsy maintsy izy io
Maybe he is.	angamba izy
But they are completely wrong.	diso tanteraka anefa izy ireo
I hope there will be others.	manantena aho fa hisy hafa
I'm so lost.	very be aho
This is not a good idea.	tsy hevitra tsara izany
The other men do all the hard work.	ny lehilahy hafa dia manao ny asa mafy rehetra
I could have had.	afaka nanana aho
That is the process.	izany no dingana
That was very true of me.	tena marina tamiko izany
Make sure this one doesn’t go wrong.	ataovy azo antoka fa tsy ho diso ity iray ity
That’s a great idea.	hevitra lehibe izany
These two ideas are not the same.	tsy mitovy ireo hevitra roa ireo
Then it might make sense.	dia mety hisy dikany izany
And they are not.	ary tsy izy ireo
It’s already too much.	efa be loatra izany
But none of these are necessary.	saingy tsy ilaina ny iray aminireo
Thanks so much again.	misaotra betsaka indray
But they had none.	tsy nanana anefa izy ireo
This is the next biggest step for him.	izany no dingana manaraka lehibe indrindra ho azy
You have to see it.	tsy maintsy mahita izany ianao
Very good choice.	safidy tena tsara
Some are dead.	ny sasany efa maty
The night is dead.	ny alina maty
You can find women there.	afaka mahita vehivavy any ianao
And it’s not fun at all.	ary tsy mahafinaritra mihitsy
There must be one of these.	tsy maintsy misy ny iray aminireo
He doesn’t have what it takes.	tsy manana izay ilaina izy
But that’s enough.	saingy ampy izany
It starts with an idea.	manomboka aminny hevitra iray izany
But it is not complete.	saingy tsy feno
We can’t seem to get enough.	toa tsy afaka ny ho ampy isika
But that is not what is most important to me.	tsy izany anefa no tena zavadehibe amiko
However, there is still a lot of work to be done.	na izany aza dia mbola be ny asa
The same is true of me.	toy izany koa ny amiko
And you don't know me.	ary tsy fantatrao aho
I used to be that fast.	haingana toy izany aho taloha
That is far from the case today.	lavitra ny zavamisy izany aminizao fotoana izao
It’s fun to do crazy at the right time.	mahafinaritra ny manao adala aminny fotoana mety
He did not need them.	tsy nila azy ireo izy
It’s so nice to have you here.	tena mahafinaritra ny manana anao eto
Nothing like the first.	tsy nisy toy ny voalohany
Better than all.	tsara kokoa noho ny rehetra
And he knew it, too.	ary fantany koa izany
Do it no matter how good you are.	ataovy izany na dia tsara toy inona aza ianao
Other jobs, however, do not.	ny asa hafa anefa tsy manao izany
It is very new.	tena vaovao ilay izy
He knows people well.	fantany tsara ny olona
Because it was so difficult for him.	satria tena sarotra taminy ilay izy
They are very close.	tena akaiky izy ireo
It is clear that they do.	mazava tsara fa manao izany izy ireo
In fact, it already exists.	raha ny marina anefa dia efa misy izany
I follow him quickly.	manaraka azy haingana aho
But you will be the last.	fa ianao no ho farany
It’s a lot of trouble.	olana maro be io
In any case, the house is always in the present.	na izany na tsy izany foana ny trano aminizao fotoana izao
That was the most important thing to him.	izany no tena zavadehibe taminy
I really know that.	tena fantatro izany
I’m both in the end.	samy aminny farany aho
Not just the idea.	tsy ny hevitra ihany
Nothing is wrong.	tsy hita izay tsy mety
There must be someone.	tsy maintsy misy olona iray
That is for sure.	azo antoka izany
I really like this one.	tiako indrindra ity iray ity
It is not here.	tsy misy izany eto
See if you like it.	jereo hoe tianao izany
There seems to be something special about this.	toa misy zavatra manokana aminity
He shouldn’t have liked it.	tsy tokony ho tiany izany
They don't see me.	tsy mahita ahy izy ireo
The weather is very bad.	tena ratsy be ny andro
I had never seen that before.	tsy nahita izany aho taloha
I saw him dead.	hitako maty izy
But something else seemed different.	nisy zavatra toa hafa anefa
The car is gone.	lasa ny fiara
We have traveled a long way.	efa nanao dia lavitra izahay
For some reason it should be.	noho ny antony sasany dia tokony ho izany
Too much time.	be loatra ny fotoana
Nothing too special.	tsy misy zavatra manokana loatra
I see clearly.	hitako tsara
Look at us !.	jereo izahay
It's like the money is mine.	toy ny hoe ahy ny vola ao
But in reality, this task is not easy.	saingy raha ny marina dia tsy mora io asa io
No one has come yet.	tsy mbola nisy tonga
In humans, he does the same.	aminny olona dia manao toy izany koa izy
He looks like me.	toa ahy izy
No one is there.	tsy misy olona ao
We are .	izahay dia
Otherwise, they would never know.	raha tsy izany dia tsy ho fantany mihitsy
This is too low.	ity dia ambany loatra
Looks beautiful, as usual.	mijery tsara tarehy toy ny mahazatra
This question seems more complicated.	toa sarotra kokoa io fanontaniana io
I don't really like them, in fact.	tsy dia tiako loatra izy ireo raha ny marina
They could not do that or do anything else.	tsy afaka nanao izany izy ireo na nanao hafa
They are three.	telo izy ireo
He knows the land around him.	fantany ny tany manodidina azy
However, there are still many issues with this.	na izany aza mbola misy olana maro momba izany
One goes alone.	ny iray mandeha irery
There was a reason for that.	nisy antony izany
And so it is with me.	ary toy izany koa ny amiko
This is my favorite time.	ity no fotoana tiako indrindra
It could be a little more.	mety ho kely kokoa
He loves it.	tiany izany
You need to do more.	mila manao zavatra bebe kokoa ianao
Not needed in remote locations.	tsy ilaina aminny toerana lavitra
You are not with him.	tsy miaraka aminy ianao
Not this one either.	tsy ity koa
I am still different.	mbola hafa aho
Now they are the same age.	ankehitriny dia mitovy taona ihany izy ireo
Things don’t seem to be too bad here.	toa tsy ho ratsy loatra ny zavatra eto
He was so much fun.	nahafinaritra be izy
It was just made for me.	natao ho ahy fotsiny izany
You have to look for it.	tsy maintsy mijery ho azy
And yes, it’s nice to be with you again.	ary eny mahafinaritra ny miaraka aminao indray
This is a good time.	fotoana tsara izany
Which you can too.	izay azonao atao koa
But it is a process.	dingana iray anefa izany
There is nothing wrong with that.	tsy misy zavatra tsy mety aminizany
But it’s better for people to watch.	tsara kokoa ho anny olona mijery anefa
There is a lot of talk about the future.	be resaka ny ho avy
But we didn't need it.	tsy nila izany anefa izahay
It is also very safe.	tena azo antoka koa izy io
The day will come soon.	ho avy tsy ho ela ny andro
I think everyone is wrong right now.	heveriko fa diso daholo ny rehetra aminizao fotoana izao
Everyone seemed happy.	toa faly ny rehetra
No one is alone.	tsy misy irery
Of course he went to her.	mazava ho azy fa lasa any aminy izy
In the real world, work has a history.	ao aminny tontolo tena izy dia manana tantara ny asa
That’s the word for him, actually.	izany no teny ho azy ny tena marina
He had a reason.	nanana ny antony izy
He loved the two women.	tiany ny vehivavy roa
If you want, you can come with me.	raha tianao dia afaka miaraka amiko ianao
But in the long run, it makes sense.	misy dikany anefa izany rehefa ela ny ela
Not a working car there.	tsy fiara miasa any
Of course, there is nothing you can do now.	mazava ho azy fa tsy misy azonao atao izao
He had it.	nanana azy izy
If you want to do it, do it.	raha te hanao izany ianao dia ataovy
Always hope for the best for you and others.	manantena ny tsara indrindra ho anao sy ny hafa foana
The important thing is the bottom.	ny zavadehibe dia ny ambany
And a new war.	ary ady vaovao
Don't look at it.	aza mijery izany
No, it went.	tsia nandeha io
This question, however, is for another day.	io fanontaniana io anefa dia ho anny andro hafa
There are also some houses.	misy koa ny trano sasany
You know he can't.	fantatrao fa tsy afaka izy
I almost didn't come.	saika tsy tonga aho
No action required.	tsy mila hetsika
The future is also unclear.	ny ho avy koa tsy hita mazava
There are many other such unusual products.	betsaka ny vokatra hafa tsy mahazatra toy izany
I think that’s really good.	heveriko fa tena tsara
But it still gets to me sometimes.	saingy mbola mahazo ahy foana izany indraindray
They had no faces.	tsy nanana tarehy izy ireo
I'm glad you're not.	faly aho fa tsy ianao
They turned out to be very good.	hita fa tena tsara izy ireo
They had no choice.	tsy nanana safidy izy ireo
This one is too much.	be loatra ity iray ity
But a lot of people seem to like doing it.	saingy maro ny olona toa tia manao izany
These others have already seen.	ireo hafa ireo efa nahita
He was very full.	feno be izy
He was not wrong.	tsy diso izy
You looked.	nijery ianao
But, so is everyone.	saingy toy izany koa ny rehetra
But for you one day.	fa ho anao indray andro any
It’s all true, but it doesn’t make sense.	marina daholo izany fa tsy misy dikany
This is clearly seen now.	hita mazava tsara izany ankehitriny
We do it because we do it.	manao izany izahay satria manao izany izahay
He knew this woman.	fantany io vehivavy io
You are so wonderful.	tena mahafinaritra ianao
Sometimes he needs to be wrong.	mila diso izy indraindray
And he, looking at me, must see himself.	ary izy mijery ahy dia tsy maintsy mahita ny tenany
Of course they’re good, that’s all.	mazava ho azy fa tsara izy ireo izay ihany
It should be seen to be good enough.	tokony ho hita fa ampy tsara izany
Mba.	mba
People around him love him.	tia azy ny olona manodidina
The day went by night.	nandeha alina ny andro
It would be very bad.	ho ratsy be izany
Someone said it could be, you know.	nisy olona nilaza fa mety ho izy fantatrao
It was so beautiful.	tena tsara tarehy ilay izy
He always did things first.	nanao zavatra aloha foana izy
It starts small, but eventually becomes very large.	manomboka aminny kely izany fa aminny farany dia lasa lehibe be
The other way around is meaningless.	ny lalana hafa dia tsy misy dikany
When we die, we are gone.	rehefa maty isika dia lasa
We didn’t really do that.	tsy dia tsy nanao izany izahay
Even himself.	na ny tenany aza
It was a wonderful time.	fotoana nahafinaritra tokoa izany
But you don’t want to do that.	saingy tsy te hanao izany ianao
We don’t work like that.	tsy miasa toy izany izahay
They are lost and he is as good as dead.	very ireo ary tsara toy ny maty izy
I hope you do more.	manantena aho fa hanao bebe kokoa ianao
Make the choice.	ataovy ny safidy
It’s a really fun thing to do.	tena zavatra mahafinaritra tokoa izany
He was always there for me.	teo foana izy ho ahy
The wrong man.	ilay lehilahy diso
Everything is still there.	misy ihany ny zavadrehetra
I still love him, he is me.	mbola tiako izy izy aho
The end result, however, is easily obtained.	ny vokatra farany anefa dia mora azo
It’s all beautiful.	tsara tarehy daholo izany
Surely we can do better than that, he said.	azo antoka fa afaka manao tsara kokoa noho izany isika hoy izy
In other words, it is one of life.	aminny teny hafa dia iray aminny fiainana izany
Even worse, he was nothing else.	mbola ratsy kokoa aza tsy nisy zavatra hafa mihitsy izy
And it could be because nothing special is coming.	ary mety ho satria tsy misy zavatra manokana ho avy
Not all actions are required.	tsy ilaina ny hetsika rehetra
And he has.	ary manana izy
Just do it for yourself.	ataovy ho anao fotsiny
There may be more.	mety hisy bebe kokoa
The little things.	ny zavatra kely
But they came.	fa tonga izy ireo
It will not be lost because you are mine.	tsy ho very izany satria ahy ianao
This is not uncommon again.	tsy mahazatra indray izany
These are just big words.	teny lehibe fotsiny ireo
But they are tough.	mafy anefa izy ireo
In fact, it is bad.	raha ny marina dia ratsy izany
I can look at anything.	afaka mijery na inona na inona aho

But that is almost not enough.	saika tsy ampy anefa izany
Yours is one of the good ones.	ny anao dia iray aminireo tsara
We can have everything.	afaka manana ny zavadrehetra isika
Now for the harder stuff.	ankehitriny ho anny zavatra sarotra kokoa
It’s really a lot of work.	tena asa be dia be izany

He never made it.	tsy tonga taminizany mihitsy izy
You should have come and told me.	tokony ho tonga ianao nilaza tamiko
I'm really lost.	tena very aho
You can be who you are.	ianao no mety ho ianao
However, they are very real.	na izany aza tena zavamisy marina izy ireo
When you do, do it right.	rehefa manao izany ianao dia ataovy tsara
However, there are possibilities.	na izany aza misy ny mety
It’s better than all the big games.	tsara kokoa noho ny lalao lehibe rehetra izany
For some people, this is a good thing.	ho anny olona sasany dia zavatra tsara izany
But no more.	tsy misy intsony anefa
All of that stuff is still there.	mbola misy izany zavatra rehetra izany
No money, they said.	tsy misy vola hoy izy ireo
However, this is the problem.	na izany aza io no olana
There was no one inside.	tsy nisy olona tao anatiny
Look at me in big words.	jereo aho aminny teny lehibe
And they have to know what they are.	ary tsy maintsy fantany hoe inona izy ireo
The house is very affordable.	tena mora ny trano
Indeed.	eny tokoa
But there was something great about him.	saingy nisy zavatra lehibe momba azy

There are many options.	betsaka ny safidy
He knew it wasn't real.	fantany fa tsy tena izy io
And they are.	ary izy ireo
He loved me once, and he still loves me.	tia ahy indray mandeha izy ary mbola tia ahy foana
I thought so too.	nieritreritra izany koa aho
I have my place.	manana ny toerana misy ahy aho
Because if so.	satria raha izany
And they had words.	ary nanana teny izy ireo
And a lot of people died.	ary be dia be ny maty
Others love it.	ny hafa tia azy
Maybe it never happened and he’s doing it right.	angamba tsy nisy mihitsy izany ary manao ny marina izy
Nothing was done about them.	tsy nisy na inona na inona natao momba azy ireo
You are absolutely right about that.	tena marina ianao momba izany
This is a wonderful product.	ity dia vokatra mahafinaritra
Very good overall.	tena tsara aminny ankapobeny
He has done it for me once.	efa nanao izany ho ahy indray mandeha izy
This works best if you do it in process.	izany dia miasa tsara raha manao izany aminny dingana ianao
Everyone did something.	samy nanao zavatra ny tsirairay
Either way, yours may be right.	na izany na tsy izany mety marina ny anao
Both are now dead.	efa maty izy roa izao
And maybe sometimes they are.	ary angamba indraindray izy ireo
But there was another problem.	mbola nisy olana hafa anefa
And if he dies, we die too.	ary raha maty izy dia maty koa isika
There are a lot of people there.	betsaka ny olona any
I don't see the real question about that.	tsy hitako ny fanontaniana marina momba anio

Like, alone.	toy ny irery
And here.	ary eto
The reason is very easy to understand.	tena mora azo ny antony
But many people disagree.	saingy maro ny olona tsy mitovy hevitra
He's not there, you know.	tsy ao izy fantatrao
It’s more than usual.	mihoatra noho ny mahazatra azy izany
So you do this thing on the ground.	noho izany dia manao anio zavatra io aminny tany ianao
She had never looked so beautiful before.	mbola tsy nijery azy tsara tarehy toy izany izy taloha
He is indeed dead.	efa maty tokoa izy
There was no history.	tsy nisy tantara
Really crazy, really fun.	tena adala tena mahafinaritra
They are so different.	hafa loatra izy ireo
He was a wonderful man.	lehilahy nahafinaritra azy
The faster the better.	ny haingana no tsara kokoa
It doesn't seem right to you.	toa tsy mety aminao izany
It didn’t work.	tsy nandeha izany
Nothing will be lost in the end.	tsy misy ho very aminity farany
But maybe that way is better.	fa angamba tsara kokoa izany fomba izany
It seemed like it never existed.	toy ny tsy nisy mihitsy izy io
But this is not entirely true.	tsy tena marina anefa izany
And now he was gone.	ary izao dia nandeha izy
We do it again.	manao izany indray izahay
No, that's not the right word.	tsia tsy izany no teny mety
They will do a lot of work for us.	hanao asa betsaka ho antsika izy ireo
If they need you, they come to you.	raha mila anao izy ireo dia tonga ho anao
There really is.	misy tokoa
This is a bad job.	asa ratsy izany
i love him the most.	tiako indrindra izy
The whole idea here is very simple.	ny hevitra rehetra eto dia tena tsotra
However, this process is not always easy.	na izany aza tsy mora foana io dingana io
You had a choice.	nanana safidy ianao
This is something you can do.	ity dia zavatra azonao atao
It’s all very simple.	tsotra be izany rehetra izany
Yes, better than that, actually.	eny tsara kokoa noho izany raha ny marina
It’s fast and big.	haingana sy lehibe izany
And there is still much you can do.	ary mbola betsaka ny azonao atao
Thank you so much for a great day.	misaotra indrindra fa nahafinaritra ny andro
There are new ideas here.	misy hevitra vaovao eto
We follow inside.	manaraka ao anatiny izahay
The choice is ours.	antsika ny safidy
But that’s something he doesn’t like.	saingy zavatra tsy tiany izany
And so, it becomes more about it.	ary noho izany dia lasa bebe kokoa momba izany
He is the only one.	izy ihany no izy
He did something else unusual.	nanao zavatra hafa tsy mahazatra izy
I didn’t have it in me.	tsy nanana izany tao amiko aho
Sounds good to me.	toa tsara amiko
I do not know you.	tsy fantatro ianao
They finally arrived.	tonga ihany izy ireo taminny farany
That’s a lot of food.	izany dia sakafo be dia be
However, you need to make everything simpler.	na izany aza mila manao ny zavadrehetra ho tsotra kokoa ianao
They thought about them and then maybe said.	nieritreritra momba azy ireo izy ireo ary avy eo angamba nilaza
No one was killed.	tsy nisy ny maty
I had never seen anything like it before.	tsy mbola nahita toy izany mihitsy aho taloha
Only us.	isika ihany
Well not really early.	eny fa tsy tena aloha
There are so many of them.	be dia be izy ireo
Stupid, he said.	adala hoy izy
People have never seen anyone like him.	mbola tsy nahita olona toa azy mihitsy ny olona
The type.	ny karazana
Life is a war.	ady ny fiainana
May you be there.	mba mety ho eo ianao
Yes, they said.	eny hoy izy ireo
It all seems so unusual.	toa tsy mahazatra loatra izany rehetra izany
It’s all exactly the same.	mitovy tanteraka daholo izany
He absolutely loved it.	tiany tanteraka izany
We all are.	isika rehetra dia
He loved the car.	tiany ilay fiara
Not about him.	tsy momba azy
Neither they, nor all of us.	na izy ireo na isika rehetra
And of course, they’re both great men.	ary mazava ho azy fa samy lehilahy lehibe izy roa
That is enough for them.	ampy ho azy ireo izany
They are always difficult when they arrive.	sarotra foana izy ireo rehefa tonga
But there was simply no such thing.	saingy tsy nisy toy izany tsotra izao
Need to look at the part.	mila mijery ny ampahany
I look at you, look at them.	mijery anao aho mijery azy ireo
It's a nice place, busy.	toerana mahafinaritra io be atao
If we can get the right people.	raha afaka mahazo olona mety isika
Everything was still there.	mbola teo daholo ny zavadrehetra
Evil is made righteous.	ny ratsy natao ho marina
There are ways, of course.	misy fomba mazava ho azy
This is my problem.	ity ny olana amiko
It goes a long way easily.	mandeha lavitra mora foana
He is very different without it.	tena hafa mihitsy izy raha tsy misy anio
But it's all your fault.	fa diso anao daholo izany
But the end has not yet come.	tsy mbola tonga anefa ny farany
I can have mine and I can.	afaka manana ahy aho ary mety aminizany
He did not know the truth.	tsy fantany ny marina
See if you can get anything.	jereo raha afaka mahazo na inona na inona ianao
I'm busy here.	be atao eto aho
He never saw me.	tsy nahita ahy mihitsy izy
It won’t be easy and it may not be pretty.	tsy ho mora izany ary mety tsy ho tsara tarehy
But that’s a good question.	fa fanontaniana tsara izany
I'm lost.	very aho
Everyone has their own.	samy manana ny azy ny tsirairay
But we are not all with that.	saingy tsy miaraka aminizany isika rehetra
He never came.	tsy tonga mihitsy izy
It didn’t come.	tsy tonga izany
He did more work for us.	nanao asa bebe kokoa ho antsika izy
Yes, this time.	eny ity indray mandeha ity
But there are many reasons.	maro anefa ny antony
Of course too much.	mazava ho azy fa be loatra
There is no end to it.	tsy misy farany izany
No, he looked at me carefully.	tsia nijery ahy tsara izy
Overall, the trip was good.	aminny ankapobeny dia tsara ny dia
Not for everyone.	tsy ho anny rehetra
So, that is where we are now.	noho izany izay no misy antsika ankehitriny
That's just enough.	ampy fotsiny izany
But we did what we had to do.	nanao izay tsy maintsy natao anefa izahay
He is real to me.	tena misy izy amiko
It will be so.	dia ho toy izany
Either way, there you are.	na izany na tsy izany eo ianao
I really like it one day.	tena tiako izany indray andro any
He may not be alone.	mety tsy ho izy irery
I still have that problem.	mbola manana izany olana izany aho
If you go one way.	raha mandeha aminny lalana iray
And that is.	ary izany dia
We’ve all seen it.	nahita izany izahay rehetra
Which is good when everything goes.	izay tsara rehefa mandeha ny zavadrehetra
But of course it’s another process.	saingy mazava ho azy fa dingana hafa izany
They can all be found here.	hita eto daholo izy ireo
The news is better.	ny vaovao dia tsara kokoa
He found someone who was right for him.	nahita olona tena mety aminy izy
But it’s something completely different.	saingy zavatra hafa tanteraka izany
You will know when it comes.	ho fantatrao rehefa tonga izany
It might have been, but he didn’t go.	mety ho izany saingy tsy nandeha izy
He may not even be there.	mety tsy ho eo akory izy
The latter is completely wrong.	diso tanteraka ity farany
Both are true.	samy marina ireo
I could be wrong, of course.	mety ho diso aho mazava ho azy
You did it yourself.	ianao mihitsy no nanao azy
It sounds good to be right.	toa tsara ny hoe marina
I'm glad you're happy.	faly aho fa faly ianao
So we went a long way.	dia nandeha be izahay
For no reason, but did.	tsy nanana antony fa nanao
He was the first to see me.	izy no nahita ahy voalohany
We really existed.	tena nisy izahay
This is not often necessary.	tsy ilaina izany matetika
There were three main results.	nisy vokatra telo lehibe
He may have been there.	mety efa teo izy
I couldn't do that now.	tsy afaka nanao izany aho izao
But it was not night.	tsy alina anefa izany
He is still young.	mbola kely izy
It’s all hard work.	asa mafy daholo izany
Yes it is absolutely true.	eny marina tanteraka izany
To me it is.	amiko izany
It doesn’t always exist.	tsy misy foana izany
That we are free is only partially true.	ny hoe afaka isika dia ampahany ihany no marina
So, three people.	noho izany olona telo
He doesn’t really work.	tsy tena miasa izy
But they finally came.	saingy tonga ihany izy ireo taminny farany
It’s money, money, money.	vola vola vola izany
I'd love to see you there !.	tiako ny mahita anao any
It made sense to him.	nisy dikany taminy izany
Now it’s gone.	ankehitriny dia lasa izany
It’s a bit like life really is.	somary toy ny fiainana tokoa
It goes like this.	mandeha toy izao izany
You should know.	tokony ho fantatrao
That could be a problem.	mety ho olana izany
Therefore, women are essential and no more than that.	noho izany ny vehivavy dia tena ilaina fa tsy mihoatra noho izany
In the same thing.	ao aminny zavatra ihany
Not too much, but a little.	tsy be loatra fa kely
What matters is ours.	ny zavadehibe ny antsika
It’s too big for us.	lehibe loatra ho antsika izany
And they should know.	ary tokony ho fantany
Basically, a crazy night.	aminny ankapobeny alina adala
I will not be happy there.	tsy ho faly aho any
They did a great job.	nanao asa ambony izy ireo
I have already started again.	efa nanomboka indray aho
History is the meaning.	tantara no dikany
But they were nearby.	teo akaiky teo anefa izy ireo
Not all of them did.	tsy izy rehetra no nanao izany
This other method is very inefficient.	ity fomba hafa ity dia tena tsy mety
The year is very good.	tena tsara ny taona
And because she is a woman.	ary satria vehivavy izy
Just for him.	ho azy ihany
As in any normal conversation, there are pros and cons.	toy ny aminny resaka mahazatra dia misy ny mety sy ny tsy mety
They are also very good.	tena tsara koa izy ireo
It seemed like a good idea at the time.	toa hevitra tsara izany taminizany fotoana izany
They are here for you and me.	eto izy ireo ho ahy sy ianao
Yes, thank you for having me.	eny misaotra anao manana ahy
It can’t be done for him.	tsy azo atao ho azy izany
At the moment it is.	aminizao fotoana izao dia
If it was lost, it was not there.	raha very izany dia tsy nisy izany
It was almost on him.	saika teo aminy izany
Maybe it’s just crazy.	adala ihany angamba
They are meaningless at first.	tsy misy dikany izy ireo aminny voalohany
The good and the bad.	ny tsara sy ny ratsy
He must be crazy.	azo antoka fa adala izy
That moment is what matters.	io fotoana io no zavadehibe
To me it’s just as simple.	amiko dia tsotra toy izany ihany
It became a part of me.	lasa ampahany tamiko izany
It was almost fun.	saika nahafinaritra izany
The night is near.	efa akaiky ny alina
Overall very good.	aminny ankapobeny dia tena tsara
He saw pictures in every house.	nahita sary tao aminny trano rehetra izy
Some, perhaps many of them, are already dead.	ny sasany angamba ny maro aminizy ireo dia efa maty
They were both able to draw quickly.	samy afaka nanao sary haingana izy ireo
I shouldn't even be here.	tsy tokony ho eto akory aho
We are very far away.	lavitra be izahay
You are from here.	avy eto ianao
Not bad, not bad at all.	tsy ratsy tsy ratsy mihitsy
No job could be more crazy.	tsy misy asa mety ho adala kokoa
No one seems to be very good.	toa tsy misy olona tena tsara
It’s a crazy world.	tontolo adala izany
Same as before.	mitovy aminny fomba teo aloha ihany
Not found.	tsy hita
And even.	ary na dia
Very easy to work with.	tena mora ny miasa
The problem is, they were able to see us too.	ny olana dia afaka nahita anay koa izy ireo
We had no one.	tsy nanana olona izahay
Two years, though.	roa taona na dia
Or it could be something else.	na mety ho zavatra hafa izany
I'm glad you're here.	faly aho fa eto ianao
Without it, there is not the least.	raha tsy misy dia tsy misy ny kely indrindra
But it can also be expected at the same time.	saingy afaka manantena ihany koa izy io aminny fotoana iray ihany
Yes, this is one of those times.	eny ity no iray aminireo fotoana ireo
There seemed to be no end in sight.	toa tsy nisy farany intsony
No work to do.	tsy misy asa atao
But we were able to do it.	saingy afaka nanao izany izahay
That's the only way.	izany ihany no fomba
It could be two of them.	mety ho ny roa aminizy ireo
Time does not pass.	tsy mandeha ny fotoana
He looked at her hard.	nijery azy mafy izy
Even you can’t follow us.	na ianao aza tsy afaka manaraka anay
This is the worst.	io no ratsy indrindra
We work on this in general.	miasa eto aminity ankapobeny ity izahay
Got a lot of space.	nahazo toerana be dia be
I think it was good.	amiko dia tsara ilay izy
Little things, nothing.	zavatra kely tsy misy na inona na inona
He will be very happy with this.	tena ho faly izy aminity
Very accurate.	tena marina tsara
But with good comes evil.	fa miaraka aminny tsara ny ratsy
It seemed to go well.	toa nandeha tsara izany
That’s another thing.	izany no zavatra hafa
Although he said no.	na dia nilaza aza izy fa tsia
For some people.	ho anny olona sasany
But not many others.	fa tsy dia maro ny hafa
Like too much.	toy ny be loatra
It’s not good or bad.	tsy tsara na ratsy izany
Everything is really hard work.	asa mafy tokoa ny zavadrehetra
It could be the same.	mety ho toy izany koa izy
The work itself is what matters.	ny asa mihitsy no zavadehibe
You are life to me.	ianao no fiainana ho ahy
They did everything.	nanao ny zavadrehetra izy ireo
It’s hard to be real.	mafy ny tena
Maybe that’s where we are now.	angamba izany no toerana misy antsika ankehitriny
However, we have to do it.	na izany aza tokony hanao izany isika
The thing didn't work.	tsy nandeha ilay zavatra
Of course I didn’t want to do that.	mazava ho azy fa tsy te hanao izany aho
We’ve been thinking that kind of thing, you know.	efa nieritreritra izany karazana izany izahay fantatrao
We must see it.	tsy maintsy mahita azy isika
I used to love him.	tia azy aho taloha
This is the main problem.	izany no tena olana lehibe
But it will not be easy.	tsy ho tsotra anefa izany
But it’s not always fun.	tsy mahafinaritra foana anefa
It's mine, he said.	ahy io hoy izy
Ours might make that trip.	ny antsika dia mety hanao izany dia
We can do better now.	afaka manao zavatra tsara kokoa isika ankehitriny
We will see a lot.	ho hita be dia be isika
He must be lost.	tsy maintsy very izy
In a long way.	aminny lalana lavitra
They both seem to be good people.	samy toa olona tsara izy roa
I hope it never comes to that.	manantena aho fa tsy ho tonga aminizany mihitsy
It is not necessary now.	tsy ilaina izany ankehitriny
Bigger, than one thing.	lehibe kokoa noho ny zavatra iray
Then, it becomes difficult.	avy eo lasa sarotra
And then this is the first picture.	ary dia ity no sary voalohany
But there is another step.	misy dingana hafa anefa
He said it wasn't.	nilaza izy fa tsy izany
It was always full of action.	feno hetsika foana ilay izy
He told me it was not possible.	nilaza tamiko izy fa tsy azo atao izany
Maybe he can't either.	tsy afaka koa angamba izy
But not all of them are like that.	tsy toy izany daholo anefa izy ireo
But now he is different.	hafa mihitsy anefa izy izao
I have a little.	kely ny ahy
The man saw her.	nahita azy ilay lehilahy
We can start all over again.	afaka manomboka indray isika
He will grow up and so will he.	ho lehibe izy ary ho toy izany koa izy
We have a house, not a house.	manana trano izahay fa tsy trano
As with any process, however.	toy ny aminny dingana rehetra anefa
You know what you will get there.	fantatrao izay ho azonao any
It will be very difficult for me.	ho sarotra be amiko izany
Sometimes, a lot.	indraindray betsaka
And that is for all species.	ary izany dia ho anny karazana rehetra
Everything is working now.	miasa izao ny zavadrehetra
Something had to be done, and quickly.	nisy zavatra tsy maintsy natao ary haingana
But it is not possible.	tsy azo atao anefa
That's the idea.	izany no hevitra
It was completely empty.	foana tanteraka ilay izy
I looked there.	nijery tany aho
It will be quick and easy.	ho haingana sy mora izany
He really liked it.	tena tiany ilay izy
That seems reasonable.	toa mety izany
It is still possible.	mbola azo atao izany
No one was watching us.	tsy nisy nijery anay
If you need something bad, just do it.	raha mila zavatra ratsy ianao dia ataovy fotsiny
Here they found a suitable home.	eto izy ireo dia nahita trano mety tsara
And not for the first time.	ary tsy vao voalohany
Had to stay somewhere.	tsy maintsy nijanona tany ho any
The house is far away.	ny trano dia lavitra
You can’t have something trivial.	tsy afaka manana zavatra tsy misy dikany ianao
It was a crazy time for me.	fotoana adala tamiko izany
He needs to do well.	mila manao tsara izy
Too far, they said.	lavitra loatra hoy izy ireo
Many of them are not.	maro aminizy ireo no tsy
Even now we are, one on one.	na dia izao aza isika iray aminny iray
For each, they are less meaningful.	aminny tsirairay dia tsy dia misy dikany loatra izy ireo
Still wrong question.	mbola diso fanontaniana
But the truth is, it didn’t make sense.	saingy ny marina dia tsy nisy dikany izany
Apparently he wasn’t completely wrong.	hita fa tsy diso tanteraka izy
It should be bad too.	tokony ho ratsy ihany koa
It's not there yet.	tsy mbola ao
It was never fun.	tsy nahafinaritra mihitsy izany
And he doesn’t seem to be alone.	ary toa tsy irery izy
That is, it did.	izany hoe nanao izany
Maybe he knew the real story.	angamba fantany ny tena tantara
We don’t have a perfect one without the other.	tsy manana iray tanteraka isika raha tsy misy ny iray
But he.	fa izy
They need me.	mila ahy izy ireo
He could not walk far.	tsy afaka nandeha lavitra izy
Maybe they will.	angamba hanao izany izy ireo
Then it went away.	avy eo dia lasa dia
There was worse news to come.	nisy vaovao ratsy kokoa ho avy
I don’t think he ever saw her.	heveriko fa tsy nahita azy mihitsy izy
You always thought there would be more time.	nieritreritra foana ianao fa mbola hisy fotoana bebe kokoa
But I can't.	saingy tsy afaka
Because you are here.	satria eto ianao
And that is what he wants for all of us.	ary izany no tiany ho antsika rehetra
This may or may not be true.	mety ho marina izany na tsia
Only three cars.	fiara telo ihany
This is very difficult at times.	tena sarotra tokoa izany indraindray
It’s no different.	tsy misy hafa aminizany
I've been watching you.	efa nijery anao aho
You are not there.	tsy eo ianao
But then again.	fa avy eo indray
Of course, they did not.	mazava ho azy fa tsy nanao izany izy ireo
But it’s really fun to have it.	tena mahafinaritra anefa ny manana izany
You can’t start anything.	tsy afaka manomboka na inona na inona ianao
Sometimes, he could see it too.	indraindray afaka nahita izany koa izy
But the conversation is easy.	fa mora ny resaka
We always have, and will always do.	manana foana isika ary hanao izany foana
And it’s fun, too.	ary mahafinaritra koa izany
Maybe not enough.	angamba tsy ampy
Death in general.	maty aminny ankapobeny
There are always people.	misy olona foana
I want it to come naturally.	tiako ho tonga ho azy izany
I don’t want him to be unhappy.	tsy tiako tsy ho faly izy
But that is far from it.	saingy lavitra izany
It was important to him.	zavadehibe taminy izany
The same is true for the other words in the.	toy izany koa ho anny teny hafa ao aminny
But you have to get the truth.	fa tokony ho azonao ny marina
First, he looked good.	voalohany nijery tsara izy
It’s all hard about this story.	mafy daholo ny momba ity tantara ity
Beautiful place there.	toerana tsara tarehy tao
This process went well.	nandeha tsara izany dingana izany
In general, this is not a major issue.	aminny ankapobeny dia tsy olana lehibe izany
Not much to talk about.	tsy dia be resaka
And it couldn’t be done.	ary tsy azo natao izany
Two women and one man.	vehivavy roa ary lehilahy iray
He didn't need that fool.	tsy nila anio adala io izy
It doesn’t make any sense at all.	tsy misy dikany mihitsy izany
At the bottom.	aminny farany ambany
She’s just fun.	mahafinaritra fotsiny izy
This does not seem to be new.	toa tsy vaovao mihitsy izany
He was very fast.	haingana be izy
I love some of them.	tiako ny sasany aminizy ireo
It is no more.	tsy misy intsony izany
No one in the world does that.	tsy misy olona eto aminizao tontolo izao manao izany
He sees people.	mahita olona izy
For them, it is a job.	ho azy ireo dia asa izany
I just started.	vao nanomboka aho
From the beginning to the top.	manomboka aminny voalohany ka hatrany ambony
One word and no more.	teny iray ary tsy misy intsony
These are people.	olona ireo
It doesn’t make sense because it doesn’t exist.	tsy misy dikany satria tsy misy
It is a good choice for many people.	safidy tsara ho anny olona maro izany
Many have it now.	maro no manana izany ankehitriny
And people came.	ary tonga ny olona
There they did it.	tany izy ireo no nanao izany
First of all, it may be small.	voalohany indrindra mety ho kely izany
However, this is true.	na izany aza marina izany
And here it is.	ary dia izao ny
He needs to see where he is.	mila mahita ny misy azy izy
Often there was nothing.	matetika dia tsy nisy na inona na inona
That must be the case.	tsy maintsy izay no misy azy
Both times were really fun.	nahafinaritra tokoa ireo fotoana roa ireo
It works for us now.	miasa ho antsika izany ankehitriny
He did nothing.	tsy nanao na inona na inona izy
I am far from me.	lavitra ahy aho
He is great.	izy no lehibe
One is new.	ny iray dia vaovao
It’s so full.	tena feno tanteraka izany
I think that is very important.	heveriko fa tena ilaina tokoa izany
Without them, this work would not have been possible.	raha tsy nisy azy ireo dia tsy ho tanteraka izany asa izany
There was another part.	nisy ampahany hafa
He’s kind of crazy.	karazana adala toy izany izy
All games.	ny lalao rehetra
Years were a big part of that.	ny taona dia ampahany lehibe taminizany
The idea is very simple.	tsotra be ilay hevitra
He could come and go as he pleased.	afaka tonga sy nandeha araka izay tiany izy
But no one has been able to do that yet.	saingy mbola tsy nisy afaka nanao izany
It goes like this.	dia mandeha toy izao
He had the news, which was little there.	nanana ny vaovao izy izay kely teo
The results will come.	ho avy ny vokatra
The same is true of food.	toy izany koa aminny sakafo
I love you too.	tiako koa ianao
They look their best at work.	izy ireo dia mijery tsara indrindra aminny asa
And that’s a really good thing.	ary zavatra tena tsara izany
There is not too little work.	tsy misy asa kely loatra
And there is the problem.	ary misy ny olana
It takes work.	mila asa izany
I've seen you do that.	efa hitako nanao izany ianao
I shouldn't have come, he thought.	tsy tokony ho tonga aho hoy izy nieritreritra
Yes, but not always.	eny fa tsy foana
You’re crazy, ho.	adala ianao ho
That could be far worse.	mety ho ratsy lavitra izany
It’s never easy.	tsy mora mihitsy izany
Even if it doesn’t make sense.	na dia tsy misy dikany aza
They must have been almost there.	tsy maintsy saika teo izy ireo
But that won't be too bad.	tsy ho ratsy loatra anefa izany
Now they may both be lost.	ankehitriny dia mety ho very izy roa ireo
But not so today.	tsy toy izany anefa ankehitriny
Special place.	toerana manokana
You came here because of him.	tonga eto ianao noho izy
But he knew that all of this was meaningless.	fantany anefa fa tsy misy dikany izany rehetra izany
And it’s certainly one of those times.	ary azo antoka fa iray aminireo fotoana ireo izany
The action is the same.	toy izany koa ny hetsika
Good news for.	vaovao tsara ho anny
Everyone sees the same information.	ny olona rehetra dia mahita vaovao mitovy
But now he was looking at her.	nijery azy anefa izy izao
And not too far into the future.	ary tsy lavitra loatra aminny ho avy
That in turn is big and a difficult issue as well.	izay indray no lehibe ary olana sarotra ihany koa
He had nothing for himself.	tsy nanana na inona na inona ho azy izy
It is.	izy io
So everyone else.	ka ny hafa rehetra
Almost all the time, in fact.	saika aminny fotoana rehetra raha ny marina
Also good on the road.	tsara ihany koa aminny lalana
Like nothing happened.	toy ny tsy nisy na inona na inona
But there is no time for that.	tsy misy fotoana anefa izany
We don't need him.	tsy mila azy isika
He, in turn, is himself a familiar and pleasant person.	izy indray dia ny tenany mahazatra sy mahafinaritra
Look at that.	jereo izany
But some games can have many, many more.	saingy ny lalao sasany dia mety manana maro maro hafa
But no one is honest in everything.	tsy misy olona marina anefa aminny zavatra rehetra
You have grown up, he told himself.	efa lehibe ianao hoy izy taminny tenany
We have to take a little more steps.	tsy maintsy manao dingana kely kokoa isika
So he's happy about it.	ka faly aminizany izy
We are very happy about that.	tena faly izahay noho izany
He knew the question.	fantany ilay fanontaniana
All life.	ny fiainana rehetra
But the future.	fa ny ho avy
But even if he did, it didn’t make sense.	saingy na dia nanao izany aza izy dia tsy misy dikany izany
He is the only one here who has all the possibilities.	izy irery no eto manana ny mety rehetra
The future is even worse.	mbola ratsy kokoa aza ny ho avy
You can see them.	afaka mahita azy ireo ianao
Need you now.	mila anao izao
This is it.	izao izany
This is simply wrong.	diso tsotra izao izany
They grew up there, and they died there.	lehibe any izy ireo ary maty any
But there is no problem.	tsy misy olana anefa
Nothing simple, you say.	tsy misy zavatra tsotra hoy ianao
Now we look and see.	ankehitriny isika dia mijery sy mahita
Even a little about him.	na kely aza ny momba azy
And he won't.	ary tsy hanao izany izy
I don’t like it at all.	tsy tiako mihitsy
So, it’s not you, it’s them.	noho izany tsy ianao izany fa izy ireo
Couldn’t be more wrong.	tsy mety diso kokoa
He stopped immediately.	nijanona avy hatrany izy
We can get him something else.	afaka mahazo azy zavatra hafa isika
There are better options out there.	misy safidy tsara kokoa any
There is no time for questions.	tsy misy fotoana ho anny fanontaniana
He knew it was made for the best.	fantany fa natao ho anny tsara indrindra izany
There is so much to do day and night.	betsaka ny zavatra atao na andro na alina
It didn’t make much sense.	tsy dia nisy dikany loatra
It suits me.	mety amiko izany
He alone.	izy ihany
They are always there for you.	eo foana ho anao izy ireo
He had to do something, and quickly.	tsy maintsy nanao zavatra izy ary haingana
He was always wrong.	izy foana no diso
You are not the same as before.	tsy toy ny taloha intsony ianao
You have to go all the way.	tsy maintsy mandeha aminny lalana rehetra ianao
He was about two years old.	roa taona teo ho eo izy
It seems more like that.	toa toy izany kokoa izany
Yes, he is.	eny izy
This is not a bad place.	tsy toerana ratsy izany
I should have stopped.	tokony nijanona aho
And maybe it wasn’t that fun anymore.	ary angamba tsy nahafinaritra toy izany intsony
It's yours alone.	anao irery izany
All of these are completely different.	ireo rehetra ireo dia tsy mitovy aminy mihitsy
The old days.	ny andro taloha
He has already arrived.	efa tonga izy
It was very fast.	haingana mafy ilay izy
And it shouldn’t.	ary tsy tokony
This is the best.	ity no tsara indrindra
He was able to start a new life.	afaka nanomboka fiainana vaovao izy
The day is near.	ny andro izay efa akaiky azy
It’s well worth it, of course.	tena mendrika izany mazava ho azy
No, you are not alone.	tsia tsy irery ianao
I will not do anything.	tsy hanao na inona na inona aho
Where no one was.	izay tsy nisy olona
I could have done it, actually.	afaka nanao izany aho raha ny marina
I don’t like it at all.	tsy tiako mihitsy izany
War is war.	ady ny ady
You really need to work on that.	tena mila miasa aminizany ianao
Maybe it should.	angamba tokony izany
They are very good people.	olona tena tsara izy ireo
The car stopped.	nijanona ilay fiara
I have the best of both worlds.	manana ny tsara indrindra aminny tontolo roa aho
It's easy.	mora ilay izy
Such a wonderful day.	andro mahafinaritra toy izany
Yes, not for long.	eny tsy ela
He did not want to lose what he had.	tsy tiany ny very izay azy
There was really nothing special about it.	tena tsy nisy zavatra manokana momba izany
The world is not our world.	tsy izao tontolo izao misy antsika izao tontolo izao
He will be great.	ho lehibe izy
It’s really not easy to find you.	tena tsy mora ny nahita anao
All of this also works.	izany rehetra izany koa dia miasa
I still can't die.	mbola tsy mety maty aho
I’m glad to have them.	faly aho manana azy ireo
The process can be done in many ways.	ny dingana dia azo atao aminny fomba maro
But not often.	saingy tsy matetika
We have a fun game in three stages.	manana lalao mahafinaritra isika aminny dingana telo
That sounds like a great idea.	toa hevitra mahafinaritra izany
I am high.	ambony aho
That is not the problem.	tsy izay no olana
That was something bad for me.	nisy zavatra ratsy tamiko izany
It’s more than usual, he thought.	mihoatra noho ny mahazatra izany hoy izy nieritreritra
Because it is not enough.	satria tsy ampy izany
It was all done for me.	natao tamiko daholo izany
However, the two are very different.	na izany aza samy hafa be izy roa
A little different than us.	hafa kely noho isika
I had to take a closer look to see the real story.	tsy maintsy nijery akaiky aho vao nahita ny tena tantara
There are two men.	misy lehilahy roa
He looks new.	toa vaovao izy
Everything started to mean more to me.	nanomboka nisy dikany bebe kokoa tamiko ny zavadrehetra
No, he said.	tsia hoy izy
Everything is just fun.	faly ihany ny zavadrehetra
As such, it is somewhat unclear.	araka izany dia somary tsy mazava
However, not everyone sees it that way.	na izany aza tsy ny rehetra no mahita azy toy izany
We didn’t and we won’t.	tsy nanao izany izahay ary tsy hanao izany
This man is dead.	maty io lehilahy io
So you have it.	noho izany dia manana izany ianao
Sometimes it may not even be so.	mety tsy izany mihitsy aza indraindray
This is an option for some people.	ity dia safidy ho anny olona sasany
The food was also delicious.	nahafinaritra koa ny sakafo
They don’t work hard.	tsy miasa mafy izy ireo
It has become a common thing.	lasa zavatra mahazatra izany
And, like me, he always had a great time.	ary toa ahy dia nanana fotoana nahafinaritra foana izy
And not once.	ary tsy indray mandeha
This is important to you.	zavadehibe aminao izany
The question is simple.	tsotra ny fanontaniana
But if that’s all you can do.	fa raha izay ihany no azonao atao
I'm happy about that.	faly aho noho izany
This was new to me.	vaovao tamiko izany
It’s just crazy talk.	resaka adala fotsiny izany
He knew he didn’t like it.	fantany fa tsy tiany izany
Just to be sure.	mba azo antoka ihany
Every woman will do that.	ny vehivavy rehetra dia hanao izany
For men, this is not good.	ho anny lehilahy dia tsy tsara izany
It’s a two -part problem.	olana roa ampahany izy io
She loved the food for both of us.	tiany ny sakafo ho anay roa
That is the next step.	izay no dingana manaraka
But it is always there.	eo foana anefa izany
He did not drive.	tsy nandeha fiara izy
Not much, but still more.	tsy betsaka fa mbola misy ihany
But now he is gone.	efa lasa anefa izy izao
We would be lost without it.	ho very isika raha tsy nisy azy
No, tonight is tonight.	tsia anio alina no alina
In the long run, that may be true.	rehefa ela ny ela dia mety ho marina izany
I know you are not dead.	fantatro fa tsy maty ianao
And very wrong.	ary tena diso
Other times there isn’t.	aminny fotoana hafa dia tsy misy
We are not theirs.	tsy azy ireo isika
In fact, it’s a good thing.	raha ny marina dia zavatra tsara izany
Will do it.	hanao izany
Others, less.	ny hafa kely kokoa
I even fell in love with him.	lasa tia azy mihitsy aza aho
He seems to be a decent man.	toa lehilahy mendrika izy
He is so stupid.	tena adala izy
At any time, and immediately.	aminny fotoana rehetra ary avy hatrany
Not just one of them.	tsy ny iray aminizy ireo ihany
However, in many other ways it is different.	na izany aza aminny fomba maro hafa dia hafa izany
Do not understand.	tsy mahazo
There is no question where I am.	tsy misy fanontaniana ny toerana misy ahy
No, make it necessary.	tsia ataovy tena ilaina izany
Then he looked closer.	dia nijery akaiky kokoa izy
You should know that too.	tokony ho fantatrao koa izany
It just works simple and is really fun.	miasa tsotra fotsiny izy io ary tena mahafinaritra
But maybe we are wrong.	fa angamba diso hevitra isika
Then again, it might happen.	avy eo indray mety misy izany
It’s hard to do that now.	sarotra ny manao izany ankehitriny
And of course, many do not.	ary mazava ho azy fa maro no tsy manao izany
Even if they don’t know it yet.	na dia mbola tsy fantany aza izany
Now, when they work, they work fun.	ankehitriny rehefa miasa izy ireo dia miasa mahafinaritra
But you haven't seen him in a long time.	efa ela anefa ianao no tsy nahita azy
Look at the words.	jereo ny teny
It’s not that important.	tsy hoe zavadehibe izany
He’s very, very fast, too.	tena haingana dia haingana koa izy
We are next.	izahay no manaraka
I never knew it could be that good.	tsy fantatro mihitsy hoe mety ho tsara toy izany
These conversations will not be found.	tsy ho hita ireo resaka ireo
They are like any other species.	toy ny karazana hafa izy ireo
It is more difficult to travel now.	sarotra kokoa ny nanao dia izao
I still don’t like this guy.	mbola tsy tiako io lehilahy io
This is a difficult thing to do.	izany dia zavatra sarotra atao
There was less talk.	nisy resaka kely kokoa
He did not look at the car.	tsy nijery ilay fiara izy
He is also very talkative.	be resaka koa izy
But that is not the point.	tsy izany akory anefa no zavadehibe
Maybe he knew.	angamba fantany
There is no choice you can make.	tsy misy safidy azonao atao
Not so here.	tsy toy izany eto
They make sense in many ways.	misy dikany aminny fomba maro izy ireo
This is the big one.	io ilay lehibe
Things just stopped there.	nijanona teo fotsiny ny zavatra
And he didn't.	ary tsy nanao izany izy
Everyone has their preferences.	samy manana ny tiany ny tsirairay
Or be lost.	na ho very
More needs to be done.	mbola mila atao
We don’t have the work.	tsy manana ny asa izahay
Just die like that.	maty toy izany fotsiny
That’s all you need to know.	izay ihany no tokony ho fantatrao
But he used to be a good man.	olona mendrika anefa izy taloha
Something else came to him.	nisy zavatra hafa tonga taminy
Too far.	lavitra loatra
They are exactly the same.	mitovy tokoa izy ireo
But that is not working now.	tsy mandeha anefa izany ankehitriny
Some are better than others.	ny sasany dia tsara kokoa noho ny hafa
That is the real problem.	izay no tena olana
But I can't.	saingy tsy afaka aho
Because you have a lot of money.	satria manana vola be ianao
He already knows everything about you.	efa fantany daholo ny momba anao
I can't see close.	tsy mahita akaiky aho
But we have to start almost from the beginning.	saingy tsy maintsy manomboka saika manomboka aminny voalohany isika
He just loves the pictures.	tiany fotsiny ny sary
They did not.	tsy nanao izany izy ireo
That could be a beautiful thing.	mety ho zavatra tsara tarehy izany
It was one of mine.	iray taminny ahy ilay izy
Too little or too much is not good either.	tsy tsara koa ny kely na be loatra
But it's not.	saingy tsy izy io
You will get yours.	ho azonao ny anao
But the old way still works.	saingy mbola miasa ihany koa ny fomba taloha
The world watched it.	nijery izany izao tontolo izao
I really like it.	tena tia anio aho
This is great news.	vaovao lehibe izay
They cannot be done together.	tsy azo atao miaraka izy ireo
Hard, hard, hard! 	mafy mafy mafy
Not just money.	tsy ny vola ihany
But look at this.	fa jereo ity
Make sure all the words work.	ataovy azo antoka fa miasa ny teny rehetra
This is a frequently asked question.	fanontaniana matetika izany
This is a reality now.	tena zavamisy izany ankehitriny
At other times.	aminny fotoana hafa
Nothing worth the idea.	tsy misy mendrika ny hevitra
Must love.	tsy maintsy tia
They seem to do.	toa manao izany izy ireo
You also know that you are not human.	fantatrao koa fa tsy olona ianao
Someone died first.	nisy maty aloha
He knew he had to do something.	fantany fa tsy maintsy nanao zavatra izy
Now he has not seen them.	ankehitriny dia tsy nahita azy ireo izy
They are still new.	mbola vaovao ihany izy ireo
He would never do such a thing.	tsy hanao zavatra toy izany mihitsy izy
It is time now.	fotoana ankehitriny izany
Some of them may be women, some not.	ny sasany aminizy ireo dia mety ho vehivavy ny sasany tsy
This is about you.	momba anao ity
Such a time.	fotoana toy izany
However, you still have the same problem.	na izany aza mbola manana olana mitovy aminizany ianao
Everyone had to come at the same time.	tsy maintsy tonga taminny fotoana iray ihany ny rehetra
Now, that’s a small amount of money.	ankehitriny vola kely izany
But there is this little one.	saingy misy ity kely ity
And you got a game too.	ary nahazo lalao koa ianao
Very true to one thing.	tena marina aminny zavatra iray
You did it for yourself.	ianao no nanao izany ho anao
Not very good.	tsy dia tsara loatra
They are still working.	mbola miasa izy ireo
Now, things are better.	aminizao fotoana izao dia tsara kokoa ny zavatra
You really don’t need all that.	tena tsy mila izany rehetra izany ianao
I'm not used to it.	tsy mahazatra ahy
A little more than usual.	somary mihoatra noho ny mahazatra
But this story is only part of it.	ampahany ihany anefa ity tantara ity
This is not a problem in general.	tsy olana olana izany aminny ankapobeny
Great job for everyone around.	asa lehibe ho anny rehetra manodidina
You can still be the first in the new world.	mbola afaka ny ho voalohany aminny tontolo vaovao ianao
Tonight was a little different.	somary hafa mihitsy aza ny anio alina
Now he just did something.	izao izy vao nanao zavatra
He always has.	manana foana izy
It's not like that anymore.	tsy toy izany intsony
It was hard and far away.	mafy sy lavitra ilay izy
But something is wrong.	saingy misy zavatra tsy mety
It’s important and it’s very important too.	zavadehibe izany ary tena zavadehibe koa izany
We have come too far.	efa lasa lavitra loatra isika
The question is then, what should come.	ny fanontaniana dia avy eo inona no tokony ho avy
But that may not be a good idea.	mety tsy hevitra tsara anefa izany
He needed more.	nila bebe kokoa izy
Night is coming.	ho avy ny alina
Ideas and actions things.	hevitra sy hetsika zavatra
Men should be older than women.	tokony ho lehibe kokoa noho ny vehivavy ny lehilahy
I was already thinking.	efa nieritreritra aho
One day he did it.	indray andro dia nanao izany izy
Every game starts though.	manomboka ny lalao rehetra na dia
You may need a location closer to work.	mety mila toerana akaiky kokoa ny asa ianao
Absolutely not.	tsy mety mihitsy
If you die, you die.	raha maty ianao dia maty
Both are meaningless.	samy tsy misy dikany
There is nothing wrong with that.	tsy misy ratsy mihitsy
Only one.	iray ihany
I got money for it in the first place.	nahazo vola ho azy aho taminny voalohany
Otherwise, it’s a bad thing.	raha tsy izany dia zavatra ratsy izany
No news, bad news.	tsy misy vaovao vaovao ratsy

It’s all about the people.	momba ny olona daholo izany
Basically that’s what it is.	aminny ankapobeny dia izay izany
The first step is.	ny dingana voalohany dia
In the end, man.	taminny farany lehilahy

That’s all I like.	izany ihany no tiako
And that can be difficult in life.	ary mety ho sarotra izany eo aminny fiainana
I could have told him.	afaka nilaza taminy aho
Very simple and works well.	tena tsotra ary miasa tsara
Now, you just get it all.	ankehitriny azonao fotsiny izy rehetra

It takes a lot of work.	mila asa be
Which is not the same.	izay tsy mitovy
And it is absolutely right to be stupid.	ary marina tanteraka ny ho adala
He is far more difficult than that.	sarotra lavitra noho izany izy
You know you can’t.	fantatrao fa tsy afaka
What is good for you is bad for others.	izay tsara ho anao dia ratsy ho anny hafa

And no one was happy with him.	ary tsy nisy na iray aza faly taminy
This is always where we are.	izany foana no toerana misy anay
They don’t need him anymore.	tsy mila azy intsony izy ireo
But not immediately.	tsy avy hatrany anefa
However, we had it.	na izany aza dia nanana izany izahay
I'm not good.	tsy tsara aho
But it’s certainly not necessary.	saingy azo antoka fa tsy ilaina izany

It is a process.	dingana iray izany
About three years ago, he never came back.	telo taona teo ho eo izay dia tsy tonga intsony izy
I just want to be alone.	te ho irery fotsiny aho
So, well, well.	ka tsara tsara
You are the first of these.	ianao no voalohany aminity
They are almost like different people.	saika mitovy aminny olona samy hafa izy ireo
But money has many problems.	saingy manana olana maro ny vola
Something was done.	nisy zavatra iray natao
His own.	ny azy manokana
These are just enough.	ampy fotsiny ireo
Only two pictures.	sary roa ihany
It is too early.	efa aloha be izao
That is the problem.	izany no olana
This is my favorite place.	ity no toerana mahafinaritra ahy
Soon, he knew they would be here soon.	tsy ho ela fantany fa tsy ho ela dia ho tonga eto izy ireo
Yes, no point here.	eny tsy misy hevitra eto
We have the past, the present and the future.	manana ny lasa sy ny ankehitriny ary ny ho avy isika
Then he came.	dia tonga izy avy eo
And that can be a big problem.	ary mety ho olana lehibe izany

It’s much simpler.	tsotra kokoa izany
You seem to deserve it.	toa mendrika izany ianao

Crazy, bad pictures.	sary adala ratsy
You made them.	nanao azy ireo ianao
He could be more.	mety ho bebe kokoa izy
He loved to watch.	tia nijery izy
But not today.	fa tsy izao andro izao
No one can do that.	tsy misy olona afaka manao izany
The real idea.	ny tena hevitra
And he’s better.	ary tsara kokoa izy

This is a difficult fact.	zavamisy sarotra izany
I have always loved you.	efa tia anao foana aho
All who do not die.	izay rehetra tsy maty
That is a big question.	fanontaniana lehibe izany
It was a wonderful year.	taona nahafinaritra izany
No, not true.	tsia tsy marina
He seemed to be thinking of her.	toa nieritreritra azy izy
Not for a reason.	tsy noho ny antony iray
I want to be able to do anything.	te ho afaka hanao na inona na inona aho
Although the two are small.	na dia kely aza ny roa
It was fun for them.	nahafinaritra azy ireo izany
We said the first word.	nilaza ny teny voalohany izahay
That's all you know.	izay ihany no fantatrao
Really, really.	tena misy tena misy

Yes, he is not.	eny tsy izy
He doesn’t have to work.	tsy mila miasa izy

This is crazy.	adala izany
That’s great, if you like things like that.	tena tsara izany raha tianao ny zavatra toy izany
It's not there.	tsy ao
But there is an idea.	saingy misy hevitra
It's too easy.	mora loatra izany
I don't need these.	tsy mila ireo aho
Yes, it was a woman.	eny vehivavy ilay izy
I saw them.	hitako izy ireo
It must be someone who knows it well.	tsy maintsy olona fantany tsara io
Either way, you can do it.	na izany na tsy izany azonao atao izany
I thought, maybe.	nieritreritra aho angamba
But the potential is huge.	fa ny mety ho lehibe
And there is nothing wrong with everything either.	ary tsy misy diso aminny zavadrehetra koa
But it’s often hard to come by.	saingy sarotra matetika ny tonga
But there was.	saingy nisy izany
Someone had to die.	nisy olona tsy maintsy maty
Apparently that's not what it is.	hita fa tsy inona izany
Work comes first.	ny asa no voalohany
It certainly works well.	azo antoka fa miasa tsara izy io
We are the same and we are not the same.	mitovy isika ary tsy mitovy
But the other thing is real.	saingy ny zavatra hafa dia tena izy
It stopped and looked around.	nijanona izy io ary nijery ny manodidina
It’s all really here.	tena eto daholo izany
No, there is no such thing.	tsia tsy misy toy izany
But it’s okay if you don’t.	fa tsara raha tsy manao izany ianao
The idea is not fulfilled.	tsy tanteraka ilay hevitra
It was wrong then, and it is wrong now.	diso izany taminizany ary diso izany ankehitriny
For now, the latter is still true.	aminizao fotoana izao ity farany ihany no mbola marina
They are different people.	olona hafa izy ireo
And you never know.	ary tsy fantatrao mihitsy
But no one is watching.	tsy misy mijery azy anefa
They are not things.	tsy zavatra izy ireo
But this one.	saingy ity iray ity
I work new.	miasa vaovao aho
But he didn't seem happy.	toa tsy faly loatra taminizany anefa izy
He didn't see her go.	tsy nahita azy nandeha izy
I am very new to this.	tena vaovao aho aminity
He did not know what was to come.	tsy fantany izay ho avy
But the real world doesn’t go that way.	saingy tsy mandeha toy izany ny tontolo tena izy
He did not look at the place himself.	tsy nijery ilay toerana ny tenany
Jobs are easily lost and lost.	mora very ny asa ary tsy hita intsony
He is not at all.	tsy izany mihitsy izy
And the picture is gone.	ary lasa ilay sary
He is not of good age.	tsy manana taona tsara izy
It's not like that at all.	tsy mba toy izany mihitsy
And it goes without saying.	ary mandeha ho azy
They are not like us.	tsy toa antsika izy ireo
Not everyone dies.	tsy ny rehetra no maty
This car is a safe choice.	safidy azo antoka io fiara io
Yes, that is why.	eny izany no antony
There should be no reason for that.	tsy tokony hisy antony izany
Here we have the place.	eto isika dia manana ny toerana
And women are women.	ary ny vehivavy dia vehivavy
He was looking at me now.	nijery ahy izy izao
That’s exactly what it’s all about.	izany mihitsy no tena tsara
Many of them are bigger in this way.	maro aminizy ireo no lehibe kokoa aminizany fomba izany
The day is clear now.	efa mazava ny andro ankehitriny
But no one did.	saingy tsy nisy olona nanao izany
He had other things too.	nanana zavatra hafa koa izy
Only here.	eto ihany
He said he couldn't stop.	nilaza izy fa tsy afaka nijanona
This is a completely new problem.	olana vaovao tanteraka ity
Both started.	samy nanomboka
Words in it.	teny ao anatiny
Instantly watch your favorite games.	jereo avy hatrany ny lalao tianao indrindra
He enjoyed doing it.	nahafinaritra azy ny nanao izany
This is a small problem.	olana kely ity
And we don’t have to go far.	ary tsy mila mandeha lavitra isika
However, it was nice to have that option.	na izany aza nahafinaritra ny nanana izany safidy izany
You can't make me.	tsy afaka manao ahy ianao
They have seen him.	efa nahita azy izy ireo
Maybe that’s the best.	angamba izany no tsara indrindra
So there is a reason.	noho izany dia misy antony
The end is near, some say.	efa akaiky ny farany hoy ny sasany
It certainly has one.	azo antoka fa manana iray izy io
But of course no one had.	saingy mazava ho azy fa tsy nisy nanana
He always did.	izy foana no nanao azy
He is older than she is.	be taona kokoa noho izy izy
Now it is.	ankehitriny dia
It belongs to him.	azy io
Maybe he loves me.	angamba izy tia ahy
The future is now the past.	ny ho avy izao ny lasa
I'm happy now.	faly aho izao
Crazy fun fun.	adala mahafinaritra mahafinaritra
We still have a little time.	mbola manana fotoana kely isika
He used to be fun.	nahafinaritra izy taloha
You can't do anything.	tsy afaka manao na inona na inona ianao
I think they are one.	heveriko ho iray izy ireo
And he was fun.	ary nahafinaritra izy
But they did not stop there.	tsy nijanona taminizany anefa izy ireo
It was always there, but there was something else about it.	foana ilay izy saingy nisy zavatra hafa taminizany
They came again.	tonga indray izy ireo
This is always done.	izany foana no atao
You are beautiful too.	tsara tarehy koa ianao
Another question.	fanontaniana iray hafa
They need to see the story in everything.	mila mahita ny tantara aminny zavadrehetra izy ireo
No, it seems to me.	tsy misy toa ny ahy izany
Everything else should be derived from it.	ny zavatra hafa rehetra dia tokony ho azo avy aminizany
I think you’ve seen a lot of fighting.	heveriko fa nahita ady be ianao
I thought so.	nieritreritra izany aho
It was a fun game.	lalao nahafinaritra azy io
I really enjoyed going there.	tena tiako ny nandeha tany
Now the great war.	ankehitriny ny ady lehibe
He traveled as much as he could.	nanao dia betsaka araka izay azo atao izy
You are as good as the next game.	tsara toy ny lalao manaraka ianao
But neither is he.	tsy izy koa anefa
I will be foolish because of you.	hanao adala aho noho ny aminao
It was completely different before.	hafa tanteraka ilay izy teo aloha
Not enough time.	fotoana tsy ampy
He is fast.	haingana izy
He didn’t like it very much.	tsy dia tiany loatra izany
But tonight it wasn’t right.	fa anio alina dia tsy mety izany
I thought of him in pictures.	nieritreritra azy taminny sary aho
You can still come.	afaka tonga ihany ianao
And for that we are very grateful.	ary noho izany dia misaotra indrindra izahay
This can be done easily and quickly.	azo natao mora sy haingana izany
It went really well.	tena nandeha tsara ilay izy
You have arrived.	efa tonga ianao
And he looks like me.	ary toa ahy izy
But he never was.	saingy tsy nisy mihitsy izy
And now he is gone.	ary izao dia lasa izy
He is next.	izy no manaraka
So, you never know.	noho izany tsy fantatrao mihitsy
I will be more spontaneous.	ho tonga ho azy kokoa aho
It’s probably in the news right now.	efa ao aminny vaovao angamba izany aminizao fotoana izao
He is free at any time if necessary.	afaka aminny fotoana rehetra izy raha ilaina
Either way, he does.	na izany na tsy izany dia manao izany izy
The other part of the story.	ny ampahany hafa aminny tantara
More people have jobs than ever before.	betsaka ny olona manana asa noho ny teo aloha
I think they should be about two years old.	heveriko fa tokony ho roa taona eo ho eo izy ireo
It was good.	tsara ilay izy
Easy guy, he said.	lehilahy mora hoy izy
I could not walk.	tsy afaka nandeha aho
If he can’t have me, no one can.	raha tsy afaka manana ahy izy dia tsy misy afaka
She's not pretty now.	tsy tsara tarehy izy izao
It really meant a lot to them.	tena nisy dikany ho azy ireo tokoa izany
I have a problem.	manana olana aho
That is far from it, in fact.	lavitra izany raha ny marina
He found himself.	nahita ny tenany izy
I hope everything goes well.	manantena aho fa mandeha tsara ny zavadrehetra
For others, action now.	ho anny hafa hetsika aminizao fotoana izao
We may be wrong.	mety ho diso isika
And he saw nothing.	ary tsy nahita na inona na inona izy
If we.	raha isika
He couldn't seem to think.	toa tsy afaka nieritreritra izy
You also have no photos.	tsy manana sary koa ianao
I was with them.	teo aminizy ireo aho
It makes a lot of sense.	misy dikany be
We had two options.	nanana safidy roa izahay
If nothing better.	raha tsy misy tsara kokoa
And those ideas die.	ary maty ireo hevitra ireo
But, you need to start where they are.	saingy mila manomboka aminny toerana misy azy ireo ianao
Or almost did.	na saika nanao izany
That kind of made sense.	nisy dikany izany karazana izany
Sometimes in life there is something.	indraindray eo aminny fiainana dia misy zavatra iray
They have to do it internally.	tsy maintsy manao izany ao anatiny izy ireo
But he seems to be wrong.	toa diso anefa izy
You have a problem here.	manana olana ianao eto
And each of these is very difficult to do.	ary ny tsirairay aminireo dia tena sarotra ny manao
So we can all be free.	koa afaka ny ho afaka isika rehetra
Especially not now.	indrindra fa tsy izao
Everyone was there.	teo ny rehetra
Things are not going well.	tsy mandeha ny zavamisy
No, he was wrong.	tsia diso izy
In spite of everything, it was still there.	na dia teo aza ny zavadrehetra dia mbola teo ihany
Never see anyone.	aza mahita olona mihitsy
Two days go by.	roa andro mandeha
That's all.	izany ihany
So, well, you came.	noho izany tsara tonga ianao
But we went a step further.	saingy nanao dingana bebe kokoa izahay
There is time here.	misy fotoana eto
But you really want to do something.	saingy tena te hanao zavatra ianao
It can always be done for you.	azo atao foana izany ho anao
It should be a feminine thing.	tokony ho zavatra vehivavy
I really like it.	tena tiako io
This is not all bad.	tsy ratsy daholo izany
It was a great time.	fotoana be izany
He also did not look far.	tsy nijery lavitra koa izy
Check them out below !.	jereo eto ambany izy ireo
That was, at first, for me.	izany taminny voalohany ho ahy
They are even worse than they wanted to be.	mbola ratsy lavitra noho izay tiany izy ireo
But it shouldn’t.	fa tsy tokony
And you’re right it’s a lot of work.	ary marina ny anao fa asa be
Because you are small.	satria kely ianao
The hard work can begin now.	afaka manomboka izao ny asa mafy
It will be the same for you.	ho toy izany koa ho anao
Too little for them.	kely loatra ho azy ireo
She is not beautiful.	tsy tsara tarehy izy
They do not love him more than we do.	tsy tia azy mihoatra noho isika izy ireo
No, it's very good.	tsia tena tsara ilay izy
It takes years and years and years.	mila taona sy taona ary taona
However, it is better to do it in the first place.	na izany aza tsara kokoa ny manao izany aminny fomba voalohany
We got two.	nahazo roa izahay
Without time, things can happen at any time.	raha tsy misy ny fotoana dia mety hisy ny zavatra aminny fotoana rehetra
But in the end they were there.	saingy taminny farany dia teo izy ireo
Without it, we are lost.	raha tsy misy izany dia very isika
Also, your location will be a factor.	ary koa ny toerana misy anao dia ho antony iray
Of course, this is not enough.	mazava ho azy fa tsy ampy izany
It’s just part of it.	ampahany fotsiny izany
So for no reason.	ka tsy misy antony
It can't work.	tsy afaka miasa
I think it has to be.	heveriko fa tsy maintsy ho izany
Then they started.	dia nanomboka izy ireo
That is almost none.	izany hoe saika tsy misy
But something else.	zavatra hafa anefa
Can't come fast.	tsy afaka tonga haingana
No results were obtained.	tsy nisy vokatra azo
It was all as if it had happened before.	toy ny efa nisy teo aloha izany rehetra izany
Things are not right.	tsy mety ny zavatra
There will be a lot of people there.	ho betsaka ny olona any
I like to have my own.	tiako ny manana ny ahy manokana
But this is not just another day.	tsy andro hafa fotsiny anefa izao
To me that is.	amiko dia izay
But nothing big.	saingy tsy misy zavatra lehibe
I just don’t know why.	tsy fantatro fotsiny ny antony
It could be different.	mety ho hafa izany
You can disagree, of course.	afaka tsy mitovy hevitra ianao mazava ho azy
It didn’t go well.	tsy nandeha tsara izany
But I have a question for you.	manana fanontaniana aminao anefa aho
This kind of thing.	ity karazana zavatra ity
But this does not happen automatically.	tsy mandeha ho azy anefa izany
Because it really means something to him.	satria tena misy dikany aminy izany
The same is true for insignificant people.	toy izany koa ho anny olona tsy misy dikany
It’s easier for him to get around.	mora kokoa ho azy ny manodidina
Kind of crazy.	karazana adala
They just seem fun.	toa mahafinaritra fotsiny izy ireo
Of course, we may be wrong about that.	mazava ho azy fa mety ho diso hevitra momba izany isika
I hope it never happens.	manantena aho fa tsy hisy mihitsy izany
It has to work.	tsy maintsy miasa izany
And you said it yourself.	ary ianao mihitsy no nilaza izany
Thank you for this question.	misaotra anao aminity fanontaniana ity
He stopped again.	nijanona indray izy
And that was the best thing for him.	ary izany no zavatra tsara indrindra ho azy
They did.	nanao izany tokoa izy ireo
i am alone	irery aho
The idea here is simple.	tsotra ny hevitra eto
There is a lot of evil.	be dia be ny ratsy
It was a great day.	nahafinaritra ny andro
About two years ago.	tokony ho roa taona lasa izay
It’s like losing a part of yourself.	toy ny very ampahany aminny tena
But the reality is it all needs to start somewhere.	saingy ny zavamisy dia mila manomboka any ho any ny rehetra
The reason will be seen there.	ho hita eo ny antony
It was really fun to say that.	tena nahafinaritra ny nilaza izany
It doesn’t start well.	tsy manomboka tsara
You are not really here.	tsy tena eto ianao
I arrived earlier.	tonga tany aloha aho
You will do good.	hanao ny tsara ianao
Even you.	na ianao aza
But at the right time.	saingy aminny fotoana mety
He enjoyed everything.	nahafinaritra azy ny zavadrehetra
The journey was the hardest.	ny dia no sarotra indrindra
Look! 	jereo
True and false stories.	tantara marina sy tsy marina
Times are different.	hafa ny fotoana
I don't want to be in this house.	tsy te ho ao aminity trano ity aho
One step, two steps.	dingana iray dingana roa
The same goes for all other methods.	toy izany koa ny fomba hafa rehetra
He didn’t, but he could have done it.	tsy nanao izany izy fa afaka nanao izany
He is here with me.	eto amiko izy
Maybe nothing can be done.	angamba tsy misy azo atao
These men work.	miasa ireo lehilahy ireo
For two main reasons.	noho ny antony roa lehibe
They will never do that.	tsy hanao izany mihitsy izy ireo
Stupid man.	lehilahy adala
The choice can be difficult.	mety ho sarotra ny safidy
Probably very close.	angamba tena akaiky
There is none now.	tsy misy izao
It is good that we are here.	tsara ny hoe eto isika
There are no trivial questions.	tsy misy fanontaniana tsy misy dikany
Yes, that is a problem.	eny olana izany
I hope it made sense.	manantena aho fa nisy dikany izany
i will do some.	hanao sasany aho
This is the best year for me.	ity no taona tsara indrindra ho ahy
This is probably the only place you know.	io ihany angamba no toerana fantatrao
Something completely masculine.	zavatra lehilahy tanteraka
Some people find it difficult.	ny olona sasany dia sarotra izany
We have done the work for you.	efa nanao ny asa ho anao izahay
Many of them.	maro aminizy ireo
As a matter of fact.	raha ny zavamisy izany
No one else was there.	tsy nisy olona hafa teo
People who don’t, that’s fine.	ny olona izay tsy tsara izany
He is now dead.	efa maty izao
So maybe not.	ka angamba tsy izany
Basically it will do this in other worlds.	aminny ankapobeny dia hanao izany aminny tontolo hafa izy io
Right now, the options may be too many.	aminizao fotoana izao ny safidy dia mety ho be loatra
But he is not like me.	fa tsy mitovy amiko izy
Whatever it is, it doesn’t fit well.	na inona na inona izany dia tsy mety tsara izany
In the right way, of course.	aminny fomba mety mazava ho azy
But he could think clearly.	afaka nieritreritra tsara anefa izy
He was a man and now.	izy dia lehilahy ary ankehitriny
We don’t need the same thing.	tsy mila zavatra mitovy isika
The real work begins now.	manomboka izao ny tena asa
He is completely absent.	tsy eo tanteraka izy
It’s not something special.	tsy zavatra manokana izany
It was work as usual for him.	asa toy ny mahazatra ho azy izany
Over time, they will make the story for you.	rehefa mandeha ny fotoana dia hanao ny tantara ho anao izy ireo
Love him so much.	tia azy loatra
This is the hardest part of my problem.	ity no ampahany sarotra indrindra aminny olana mahazo ahy
And yes, this is part of it.	ary eny ity dia ampahany
It needed something more.	nila zavatra bebe kokoa izany
I knew it was there.	fantatro fa nisy izany
He is nothing but a fool.	tsy inona izy fa adala
Getting a job is not easy.	tsy mora ny mahazo asa
Never do that to me.	aza manao izany amiko mihitsy ianao
You are still beautiful.	mbola tsara tarehy ianao
Maybe about everything.	angamba momba ny zavadrehetra
The results are almost identical.	ny vokatra dia saika mitovy
I always love him.	tiako foana izy
Working hard was never a problem for me.	tsy olana tamiko mihitsy ny miasa mafy
He is always happy.	faly foana izy
But you have a problem.	saingy manana olana ianao
If there is no past, there is no present, but we are only now.	raha tsy misy ny lasa tsy misy ankehitriny fa ankehitriny ihany isika
They look better now.	toa tsara kokoa izy ireo ankehitriny
It needs something.	mila zavatra izany
The reason, you have to know it.	ny antony tsy maintsy fantatrao izany
I'm fine.	tsara ny ahy
So comes the question, a common question.	noho izany dia tonga ny fanontaniana fanontaniana mahazatra
Chances are, so are you.	ny mety dia toy izany koa ianao
I’m game for history.	lalao ho anny tantara aho
He was not stupid and did not do anything wrong.	tsy adala izy ary tsy nanao ratsy
You need to know that you can be good enough.	tokony ho fantatrao fa afaka ny ho ampy ianao
I didn’t do anything right.	tsy nanao zavatra tsara aho
Either way, the important thing is that we can do the same thing.	na izany na tsy izany ny zavadehibe dia ny hoe afaka manao zavatra mitovy ihany koa isika
This is a great time for you.	fotoana lehibe ho anao izany
You never did that.	tsy nanao izany mihitsy ianao
He said it was nice to see me.	nilaza izy fa mahafinaritra ny mahita ahy
I don't see him anymore.	tsy hitako intsony izy
And we have what follows for you.	ary manana ny zavatra manaraka anao izahay
But you love me anyway.	saingy tia ahy ianao na izany aza
I'm not bad.	tsy ratsy aho
This is not how it should be.	tsy izany no tokony ho izy
You know very well that this place really existed.	fantatrao tsara fa tena nisy io toerana io
People with a reason.	olona misy antony
I lost everything.	very ny zavadrehetra aho
Yes, he did.	eny fantany tokoa
Come right away.	tonga avy hatrany
More questions perhaps.	fanontaniana bebe kokoa angamba
They have to be clear in order to be accessible.	tokony ho mazava tsara izy ireo mba ho azo
They were not alone.	tsy irery izy ireo taminizany
There is a lot of truth.	be dia be ny marina
But there was a big problem.	nisy olana lehibe iray anefa
That’s what’s important to me.	izany no zavadehibe amiko
Many others do not.	maro ny hafa tsy izany
This is tough.	mafy ity
They will know you were there.	ho fantany fa teo ianao
Sounds too good if not true.	toa tsara loatra raha tsy marina
You will be very happy.	ho faly be ianao
I love working there.	tiako ny miasa any
They were worthy, but no one else.	mendrika izy ireo saingy tsy nisy hafa
And then he thought of something.	ary avy eo dia nieritreritra zavatra izy
It will be seen to be insufficient.	ho hita fa tsy ampy
He means a lot to me.	misy dikany be amiko izy
Like nothing in the slightest.	toy ny tsy misy na dia kely aza
I find that there is none.	hitako fa tsy misy izany
That’s the same way I do.	izany no fomba mitovy amiko
Someone had to say something.	nisy olona tsy maintsy nilaza zavatra
But you know.	fa fantatrao
Such is the situation here.	toy izany ny zavamisy eto
They work, and fast.	miasa izy ireo ary haingana
Both for him.	samy ho azy
But that may not be the case.	saingy mety tsy izany no izy
I hope so.	manantena aho fa izany
Nice people around him.	olona nahafinaritra ny manodidina azy
The places are not the same.	tsy mitovy ny toerana
It’s all very difficult.	tena sarotra izany rehetra izany
There are no two ways about it.	tsy misy fomba roa momba izany
It is only for you.	dia ho anao irery ihany
There were more people than there should have been.	betsaka noho ny tokony ho nisy ny olona
I never thought of you like that.	tsy mbola nieritreritra anao toy izany mihitsy aho
And because it shouldn’t have happened, it did.	ary satria tsy tokony hisy izany dia nanao izany
He is not his either.	tsy azy koa izy
It’s a necessary issue.	resaka ilaina izany
And they never will.	ary tsy hanao izany mihitsy izy ireo
I look at him crazy.	mijery azy adala aho
You are good.	tsara ianao
And that’s where the trouble started.	ary teo no nanomboka ny olana
That is the big question.	izany no fanontaniana lehibe
Not everything is done.	tsy ny zavatra rehetra no atao
Either always do it or sometimes don’t.	na manao izany foana na tsy manao izany indraindray
There is food for everyone.	misy sakafo ho anny rehetra
He really comes to himself now.	tena tonga aminny tenany izy izao
Now.	izao izao
Don't be so stupid.	aza manao adala toy izany
It’s a little fun.	mahafinaritra kely izany
It’s with work.	miaraka aminny asa izany
Here are the words, here are the meanings.	eto ny teny eo ny dikany
I don't like you for that.	tsy tiako ianao aminizany
He is very tough.	mafy be izy
And he didn't either.	ary tsy nanana izy koa
They are all one.	iray izy rehetra
However, this is not stupid.	na izany aza tsy adala izany
And that’s good too.	ary tsara koa izany
Thank you so much for everything.	misaotra betsaka aminny zavatra rehetra
I was able to do that.	afaka nanao izany aho
Not a single one will be lost.	tsy ho very na dia iray aza
No one ever said that.	tsy nisy nilaza izany mihitsy
He doesn’t have it.	tsy manana izany izy
For him and for you.	ho azy sy ho anao
But it is not, it is near.	tsy izany anefa fa efa akaiky
So you can do anything with it.	noho izany dia afaka manao na inona na inona aminizany ianao
He is the same.	mitovy izy
But you know it all.	fantatrao anefa izany rehetra izany
It’s great.	lehibe io
It would have been better if they had done nothing.	tsara kokoa raha tsy nanao na inona na inona izy ireo
But he looked at me intently.	nijery ahy tsara anefa izy
It was a beautiful word.	teny mahafinaritra ilay izy
Probably never.	mety tsy hisy mihitsy
So we have others.	ka manana hafa isika
Of course, that is not the case here.	mazava ho azy fa tsy izany no zavamisy eto
I must be wrong.	tsy maintsy diso aho
Just like that, there was something about it.	toy izany ihany nisy zavatra teo aminy
Work on this has already begun.	efa nanomboka ny asa momba izany
Or maybe it is.	na angamba izy io
Not so good for others.	tsy dia tsara aminny hafa
But even then, it is uncertain.	saingy na izany aza dia tsy azo antoka
In fact, it is good.	raha ny marina dia tsara izany
It was no longer fun.	tsy nahafinaritra intsony ilay izy
But that doesn't seem to be coming.	toa tsy ho avy anefa izany
He is now completely lost.	very tanteraka izy ankehitriny
We were still there.	mbola nisy isika
No, it doesn't exist.	tsia tsy misy izany
Yes, it is very possible.	eny tena azo atao izany
It can’t be wrong.	tsy mety diso
But look at us now.	fa jereo izao isika
One of the best.	iray aminireo tsara indrindra
And they often seem more accurate.	ary matetika izy ireo no toa marina kokoa
But he has good reason.	manana antony ampy anefa izy
It will only be mine if need be.	ho lasa ahy ihany izy io raha ilaina
It’s all too much for me.	be loatra amiko izany rehetra izany
This is a bad place.	toerana ratsy io
The problem is already common.	efa mahazatra ny olana
I live more.	aminny fiainana bebe kokoa aho
Here's why.	ity ny antony
We played a really good game.	nanao lalao tena tsara izahay
We all had a little bit.	samy nanana kely izahay rehetra
Yes, they can work.	eny afaka miasa izy ireo
It's crazy.	adala io
No, too many years.	tsia taona maro loatra
He is far from dead.	lavitra ny maty izy
If they lose it, they lose everything.	raha very izany izy ireo dia very ny zavadrehetra
We cannot do enough.	tsy afaka manao ny ampy isika
But to you too.	fa aminao koa
You have to come alone.	tokony ho tonga irery ianao
I want you to love me.	tiako ho tia ahy ianao
I looked at the house.	nijery ny trano aho
It’s a lot of work.	asa be izany
You come to love him.	lasa tia azy ianao
You work.	ianao no miasa
It’s a sure thing.	zavatra azo antoka izy
That thing should be for you.	tokony ho anao izany zavatra izany
This is probably the biggest.	ity angamba no lehibe indrindra
But one day.	fa indray andro any
And very quickly they died.	ary haingana dia haingana dia maty izy ireo
And maybe we won’t.	ary angamba tsy hanao izany isika
Hope yours is a good go.	manantena ny anao fa tsara ny mandeha
He can have a woman he likes.	afaka manana vehivavy tiany izy
That was enough for him.	ampy ho azy izany
Many other such stories.	tantara maro hafa toy izany
In a good way.	aminny fomba tsara izany
But they couldn’t be more wrong.	saingy tsy mety ho diso kokoa izy ireo
We need to do something about it.	mila manao zavatra momba izany isika
He looked right.	nijery ny marina izy
This turns out to be untrue.	hita fa tsy marina izany
No words.	tsy misy teny
Finally, the man saw clearly.	farany dia nahita tsara ilay lehilahy
It would be crazy for him.	ho lasa adala ho azy izany
I already love him so much.	efa tiako loatra izy
So he can do it as he pleases.	noho izany dia afaka manao izany araka izay tiany izy
But it’s good.	saingy tsara izany
It is also more important than anything else.	zavadehibe kokoa noho ny zavadrehetra koa izany
We took our first steps down that path.	nanao dingana voalohany aminizany lalana izany izahay
I thought about it all.	nieritreritra izany rehetra izany aho
And of course they had.	ary mazava ho azy fa nanana izy ireo
It’s a job to come.	asa ho avy izany
It’s important, you say.	zavadehibe hoy ianao
It is also timely.	anny fotoana koa izany
Nor is he the last.	tsy izy koa no farany
There could be a reason, he knew.	mety hisy antony fantany
I know it shouldn't be.	fantatro fa tsy tokony ho izany
He is one of them.	iray aminy izy
One or two.	iray na roa
But the food is really good.	saingy ny sakafo dia tena tsara tokoa
The first is easy.	voalohany ny mora
I have the same problem.	manana olana mitovy aho
There was too much to do.	be loatra ny tsy maintsy natao taminizany
It was so bad.	tena ratsy be ilay izy
It’s more than just money.	mihoatra noho ny vola ihany izany
But for many, that is no longer the case.	saingy ho anny maro dia tsy misy intsony izany
He wanted me to come.	tiany ho avy aho
And he is the same in other ways.	ary mitovy aminy aminny fomba hafa koa izy
He wants you to know that.	tiany ho fantatrao izany
People have no idea.	tsy manana hevitra ny olona
We didn’t think to do anything wrong.	tsy nieritreritra ny hanao ratsy izahay
Or his.	na ny azy
Anyway, he's gone.	na izany na tsy izany lasa izy
And that sounds like a really good thing.	ary toa zavatra tena tsara izany
Surely we have never gone this far.	azo antoka fa mbola tsy lasa lavitra toy izao izahay
It’s not entirely about me.	tsy momba ahy tanteraka izany
Last night.	ny alina farany
I am very close.	tena akaiky aho
It seemed fuller than before.	toa feno kokoa noho ny teo aloha ilay izy
He’s not dead, not yet.	tsy maty izy tsy mbola
I am in endless work now.	ao aminny asa tsy misy farany aho izao
And he did the right thing.	ary nanao izay mety
Sometimes it’s lonely.	indraindray dia irery
This one gets me all the time.	ity iray ity dia mahazo ahy aminny fotoana rehetra
He finally stopped.	nijanona izy taminny farany
And often it works.	ary matetika dia miasa izany
What a story that will be.	ho tantara inona izany
Good people can do bad things.	afaka manao ratsy ny olona tsara
You know it doesn’t work well.	fantatrao fa tsy mandeha tsara izany
In fact, the best thing for him.	raha ny marina ny zavatra tsara indrindra ho azy
Sometimes very fast.	indraindray tena haingana
If they do, fine.	raha manao izany izy ireo dia tsara
And so it is here.	ary toy izany koa ny eto
Anything you don’t understand.	izay rehetra tsy azonao
Conversation is not very important to him.	tsy dia zavadehibe aminy ny resaka
It all still went on.	mbola nandeha ihany izany rehetra izany
He became confused.	lasa very hevitra izy
Either here or there.	na eto na any
He was a great man there.	lehilahy lehibe izy tao
It doesn’t work anymore.	tsy mandeha intsony izany
For a simple reason.	noho ny antony tsotra
It works fine now.	miasa tsara izany ankehitriny
There’s too much potential here.	be loatra ny mety ho azy eto
Whatever it means.	na inona na inona dikany
This one issue is really two issues.	ity olana iray ity dia tena olana roa
That's exactly what it is.	izany indrindra no izy
They have to be.	tsy maintsy ho izy ireo
Of course, you shouldn’t do that.	eny tokoa tsy tokony hanao izany ianao
This idea, too, is irrelevant.	ity hevitra ity koa dia tsy misy dikany
Not at all.	tsy toy izany mihitsy
But others can.	fa ny hafa afaka
I still like some things about it, of course.	mbola tiako ny zavatra sasany momba izany mazava ho azy
He is a very nice man.	lehilahy mahafinaritra tokoa izy
I have been there.	efa tany aho
You are absolutely right.	tena marina ianao
Or maybe he shouldn’t have said that at all.	na angamba tsy tokony ho nilaza izany mihitsy izy
The hard part is coming.	ho avy ny ampahany sarotra
Make sure they work.	ataovy azo antoka fa miasa izy ireo
He had watched me do that before.	efa nijery ahy nanao izany izy taloha
Do this if possible.	ataovy izany raha azo atao
So it’s nice to have it.	ka mahafinaritra ny manana azy
Sometimes there is no way.	indraindray tsy misy lalana
I hope it makes sense now.	manantena aho fa misy dikany izao
And especially not a woman like her.	ary indrindra fa tsy vehivavy toa azy
It doesn’t go to you.	tsy lasa anao izany
Now he wants to do it.	ankehitriny dia te hanao izany izy
It doesn't seem right to me.	toa tsy mety amiko izany
It was all too much for him.	be loatra ho azy izany rehetra izany
You have a lot of time.	manana fotoana betsaka ianao
You just have to be there and fast.	tsy maintsy ho eo fotsiny ianao ary haingana
Now that’s another story.	ankehitriny dia tantara hafa
Please do this.	mba ataovy izao
They may come today.	mety ho tonga anio izy ireo
What is needed is time.	ny ilaina dia ny fotoana
I know you are not like that.	fantatro fa tsy toy izany ianao
Something unusual.	zavatra tsy mahazatra
You have two of us now.	manana anay roa ianao izao
From the world.	avy aminizao tontolo izao
I don't see that question.	tsy hitako izay fanontaniana izay
I loved seeing some of it.	tiako ny nahita ny sasany taminizany
It’s his own.	izy manokana izany
I think you will like him.	heveriko fa ho tianao izy
If he wanted to, he could do it.	raha tiany dia afaka nanao izany izy
See the results.	jereo ny vokatra
Finding good people is not easy.	tsy mora ny nahita olona tsara
Worse than that, he was alone.	ny ratsy kokoa noho izany dia irery izy
Nothing was easy anymore.	tsy nisy mora intsony
Yeah, that’s a little bit.	eny somary kely izany
They love me.	tia ahy izy ireo
I will make time.	hanao fotoana aho
Yes, one can hope.	eny afaka manantena ny olona iray
That’s the only thing that really matters.	izay ihany no tena zavadehibe
He loves her.	izy no tiany
Not too big.	tsy dia lehibe
Not these.	tsy ireo
It’s different than being with you.	hafa noho ny miaraka aminao
This is the right place.	io no toerana mety
I see that he is probably better here.	hitako fa tsara kokoa angamba izy eto
I know this is not easy for you.	fantatro fa tsy mora aminao izany
That’s the hard part.	izay no sarotra
Thank you though.	misaotra anao na izany aza
Not in the real world.	tsy eo aminny tontolo tena izy
He has always been there.	efa teo foana izy
He always walks.	mandeha foana izy
There are two other parts to this.	misy ampahany roa hafa aminizany
It’s just different.	hafa ihany izany
Yes, that is not possible.	eny tsy azo atao izany
I don't need anything else.	tsy mila zavatra hafa aho
Neither of these is necessary however.	tsy ilaina ny iray aminireo na izany aza
Very happy with the results.	tena faly taminny vokatra
If only he could see her now.	raha mba afaka nahita azy izy izao
So this food issue must be important.	noho izany dia tsy maintsy zavadehibe io resaka sakafo io
Not you anymore.	tsy ianao intsony
He has a good manner.	manana fomba tsara izy
Simple things, nonsense.	zavatra tsotra tsy misy dikany
They had nothing again.	tsy nanana na inona na inona indray izy ireo
The process is very simple.	ny dingana dia tena tsotra
But this is not a bad thing either.	tsy ratsy koa anefa izany
What is less obvious is the reason.	ny tsy dia hita loatra dia ny antony
They needed a job.	nila asa izy ireo
People were happy to see him.	faly ny olona nahita azy
They couldn’t be better.	tsy afaka ny ho tsara kokoa izy ireo
The world, in fact, is easy to understand.	izao tontolo izao raha ny marina dia mora azo
But, for the most part this one is not for me.	saingy aminny ankapobeny dia tsy natao ho ahy ity iray ity
They may be in the wrong house.	mety ho any aminny trano tsy mety izy ireo
And then everything made sense.	ary avy eo dia nisy dikany ny zavadrehetra
This is what is in it.	izao no ao anatiny
We need every man.	mila ny lehilahy tsirairay isika
What is true of you is not true of everyone.	ny marina aminao dia tsy marina ho anny rehetra
Here is one.	ity misy iray
First you need to do it.	voalohany dia mila manao izany ianao
I am not a difficult person.	tsy olona sarotra aho
He hadn't seen it yet.	mbola tsy nahita izany izy
Almost any of them can work.	saika ny iray aminizy ireo dia afaka miasa
These are just the big three.	ireo ihany no telo lehibe
He fought, not one.	nanao ady izy fa tsy iray akory
More seems better.	betsaka kokoa no toa tsara kokoa
I was crazy to be there.	adala aho fa teo
So if you like.	ka raha tianao
He must know that we need him.	tsy maintsy ho fantany fa mila azy isika
He seemed to enjoy it at the time.	toa nahafinaritra azy izany taminizany fotoana izany
No, you need to work on it.	tsia mila miasa aminizany ianao
I hope you can find one one day.	manantena aho fa afaka mahita iray ianao indray andro any
It does make sense.	misy hevitra tokoa izy io
And now he is dead.	ary ankehitriny dia maty izy
I think he will be great.	heveriko fa ho lehibe izy
We are very happy.	faly be izahay
He became a word.	lasa teny izy
You should be happy about that.	tokony ho faly aminizany ianao
I hope you got them.	manantena aho fa nahazo azy ireo ianao
He had a beautiful age.	nanana taona tsara tarehy izy
He did not know the truth.	tsy fantany ny tena marina
Then you have me.	dia manana ahy ianao
We both came.	samy tonga izahay
I don’t see that either.	tsy hitako koa izany
The other three arrived quickly.	tonga haingana ny telo hafa
But often they didn’t.	saingy matetika dia tsy nanao izany
There is nothing to be gained or lost.	tsy misy na inona na inona ho azo sy ho very
They are long gone.	efa ela izy ireo no lasa
Maybe that’s not true.	angamba tsy marina izany
I just want to make food.	te hanao sakafo fotsiny aho
That time seems to have come.	toa tonga izany fotoana izany
It seemed so big, and it really was.	toa lehibe tokoa ilay izy ary tena nisy tokoa izany
They have to look closer than usual.	tsy maintsy mijery akaiky kokoa noho ny mahazatra izy ireo
I haven't seen it yet.	mbola tsy nahita aho
So we have two good options.	noho izany dia manana safidy roa tsara izahay
However, this does not seem to make sense.	na izany aza dia toa tsy misy dikany izany
I'm really good now.	tena tsara aho izao
To me though.	amiko na izany aza
There is no money right now.	tsy misy vola aminizao fotoana izao
I looked at him carefully.	nijery azy tsara aho
Yes, and we are better off without it.	eny ary tsara kokoa isika raha tsy misy izany
It arrives very quickly and fits perfectly.	tonga haingana dia haingana ary mety tsara
Now, that’s common.	ankehitriny efa mahazatra izany
It may not make much sense.	mety tsy dia misy dikany loatra izany
Almost everywhere.	saika misy eny rehetra eny
It sees reality.	mahita zavamisy izy io
And nothing is certain.	ary tsy misy azo antoka
The story is also true.	marina koa ilay resaka
They will be wrong if they do.	ho diso izy ireo raha manao izany
However, privacy is important to them now.	na izany aza zavadehibe ho azy ireo ny fiainana manokana aminizao fotoana izao
I was so happy to see him.	faly be aho nahita azy
Here, you have to work.	eto tsy maintsy miasa ianao
Maybe he will come to you.	angamba ho avy aminao izy
Whatever the thing is, it’s gone now.	na inona na inona ilay zavatra dia lasa izao
He is not one and never will be one.	tsy iray izy ary tsy ho iray mihitsy
It was nice to see some people.	nahafinaritra ny nahita olona sasany
But you have a clear path for me.	manana lalana mazava ho ahy anefa ianao
Three smaller ones.	telo kely kokoa
And they are not very clear.	ary tsy dia mazava loatra izy ireo
That’s all that matters.	izay ihany no misy dikany
To be true and true and true.	mba ho marina sy marina ary marina
You have a very good job in life.	manana asa tena tsara eo aminny fiainana ianao
I should know that by now.	tokony ho fantatro izany izao
But the idea is not the same.	tsy fomba iray ihany anefa ny hevitra
Some are that there are too many stupid people.	ny sasany dia hoe be loatra ny olona adala
Just whatever you want.	izay tianao ihany
There will never be anything like that again.	tsy hisy zavatra ho toy izany intsony
There are problems, of course.	misy olana mazava ho azy
The first problem is the following.	ny olana voalohany dia ity manaraka ity
We haven’t got it yet.	mbola tsy nahazo izany izahay
You are meaningless.	tsy misy dikany ianao
It generally works like this.	aminny ankapobeny dia miasa toy izao izany
A woman should never be alone.	tsy tokony ho irery mihitsy ny vehivavy iray
You can see it now.	afaka mahita azy ianao izao
It is enough for them to do so.	ampy ho azy ireo ny manao izany
Well, maybe another time.	eny ary mety aminny fotoana hafa
Now for the fun part.	ankehitriny aminny ampahany mahafinaritra
You are also the most beautiful.	ianao koa no tsara tarehy indrindra
Maybe that's what it is.	izany angamba no izy
People seemed happy.	toa faly ny olona
Someone is dead.	olona iray efa maty
One day he is here, there again.	indray andro izy eto any indray
I had no other choice.	tsy nanana safidy hafa aho
I think that’s all.	heveriko fa izany rehetra izany
For me these things go by themselves.	ho ahy ireo zavatra ireo dia mandeha ho azy
We see a lot of things.	mahita zavatra maro isika
Apparently not, however.	toa tsy izany anefa
As for him, it could be the same.	raha ny momba azy dia mety ho toy izany koa
It was as if they had never seen a real man before.	toy ny tsy mbola nahita lehilahy tena izy ireo taloha
And the story isn’t very good.	ary tsy dia tsara loatra ny tantara
The work was meaningless.	tsy nisy dikany ny asa
Still don’t and never will.	mbola tsy manao ary tsy hanao izany mihitsy
But it has to be fast.	tokony ho haingana anefa
Every moment is fun.	mahafinaritra ny fotoana tsirairay
Either way, the choice is yours.	na izany na tsy izany anao ny safidy
There are many options here.	betsaka ny safidy eto
Maybe it’s not always easy.	angamba tsy mora foana izany
He had never seen it come.	tsy mbola nahita izany ho avy izy
She is small and a bit ugly.	kely izy ary somary ratsy tarehy
But we’re just getting started anyway.	saingy vao nanomboka izahay na izany aza
Probably still my favorite part of you.	mety mbola ny ampahany tiako indrindra avy aminao
I got good and bad news.	nahazo vaovao tsara sy ratsy aho
This is the time.	izany no fotoana
But I will not do that.	tsy hanao izany anefa aho
That is no longer the case.	tsy izany intsony no zavamisy
The fight went well for me.	nandeha tsara ny ady tamiko
It doesn't fit well.	tsy mety tsara
He may be wrong.	mety ho diso izy
They don’t always see clearly as they should.	tsy mahita mazava araka ny tokony ho izy foana izy ireo
But it is still possible.	mbola azo atao anefa izany
The house and its interior are now mine.	ny trano sy ny ao anatiny dia ahy izao
It is not a matter of money.	tsy resaka vola io
In fact, it seems like something else.	raha ny marina toa zavatra hafa izany
In that way.	aminizany fomba izany
Of course not.	mazava ho azy fa tsy izany
I didn't even look at one.	tsy nijery ahy na dia iray aza aho
It is clear that it is coming.	efa mazava fa ho avy
And some of that will be difficult.	ary ho sarotra ny sasany aminizany
This is clear to me.	mazava amiko izany
If you can look at me.	raha afaka mijery ahy ianao
But in a much better place than before.	saingy aminny toerana tsara lavitra noho ny taloha
I hope so.	manantena aho fa
He is doing something.	manao zavatra izy
And nothing too early.	ary tsy misy aloha loatra
Next, you do something else.	manaraka izany dia manao zavatra hafa ianao
He wants the world to be a better place.	tiany ho toerana tsara kokoa izao tontolo izao
I went.	nandeha aho
Only the present is real.	ny aminizao fotoana izao ihany no tena misy
This can be done quickly.	azo atao haingana izany
In fact, it’s not as difficult as it seems.	raha ny marina tsy dia sarotra araka ny hita
We have to do it in the end.	tokony hanao izany isika aminny farany
It’s an easy choice.	safidy mora izany
And it will soon be different.	ary tsy ho ela dia hafa
Good for close work.	tsara ho anny asa akaiky
Maybe it’s better here.	angamba tsara kokoa ny eto
We may not.	mety tsy isika
It may not have been easy for him either.	mety tsy mora taminy koa izany
There’s a lot they don’t know.	betsaka ny zavatra tsy fantany
More is likely to follow.	betsaka kokoa no mety ho manaraka
Lost the no.	very ny no
Only the essentials.	ny tena ilaina ihany
He has to work, hard.	tsy maintsy miasa izy mafy
It’s a completely different person.	olona hafa tanteraka io
Not a man.	tsy lehilahy
No one was like that often.	tsy nisy olona toy izany matetika
At the time, only one thing was important.	taminizany fotoana izany dia zavatra iray ihany no zavadehibe
Don’t make that face.	aza manao izany tarehy izany
Although not like women.	na dia tsy toy ny vehivavy aza
It was a new life there.	fiainana vaovao izany tao
A very beautiful world surrounds the place.	tontolo tena tsara no manodidina ny toerana
It could be a year.	mety ho iray taona
But it’s a fun and exciting place.	fa toerana mahafinaritra sy mahafinaritra
I think he is there now.	heveriko fa eo izy izao
They have a wonderful story.	manana tantara mahafinaritra izy ireo
Not only this.	tsy izao fotsiny
Every man for himself.	ny lehilahy tsirairay ho anny tenany
The people downstairs were very nice to me.	tena tsara tamiko ny olona tany ambany
Very common as well.	tena mahazatra ihany koa
But you are wrong and you know it.	fa diso ianao ary fantatrao izany
He could never walk.	tsy afaka nandeha mihitsy izy
It’s a great place for them.	toerana tena tsara ho azy ireo izany
He is like that, no different.	toy izany izy tsy hafa
At first, she fell in love with him.	lasa tia azy izy taminny voalohany
But they are there.	saingy eo izy ireo
There wasn’t much of it.	tsy dia nisy loatra izany
Especially once you get here.	indrindra raha vao tonga eto ianao
But this is not easy.	tsy tsotra mihitsy anefa izany
They are all over us.	eny rehetra eny momba antsika izy ireo
And you are mine.	ary ahy ianao
He said he could.	nilaza izy fa mety ho izy
But, you could be.	saingy mety ho ianao
It seems familiar about him.	toa mahazatra ny momba azy
There was no more money for food.	tsy nisy vola intsony ho anny sakafo
But they did not walk alone.	tsy nandeha irery anefa izy ireo
I will do it here.	hanao izany aho eto
It is still much lower than his.	mbola ambany lavitra noho ny azy izany
I love him right away.	tiako izy avy hatrany
And there was nothing trivial.	ary tsy nisy na inona na inona tsy misy dikany
Here again we disagree.	eto indray dia tsy mitovy hevitra isika
You are as fun as she is !.	mahafinaritra toa azy ianao
Yes, it’s just words.	eny teny fotsiny izany
When you look at all the parts.	rehefa mijery ny ampahany rehetra ianao
I would be crazy otherwise.	ho adala aho raha tsy izany
You're right, that's right.	tena marina ianao marina izany
Once, then again.	indray mandeha avy eo indray
But facts first.	fa zavamisy aloha
There is nothing more beautiful.	tsy misy zavatra tsara tarehy kokoa
We could have done it better.	afaka nanao izany tsara kokoa izahay
This can be a real problem.	mety ho olana tokoa izany
Very good, actually.	tena tsara raha ny marina
None of them.	tsy misy aminizy ireo
This is impossible.	tsy azo atao mihitsy izany
Especially in the beginning.	indrindra fa taminny voalohany
You start.	manomboka ianao
It’s a really fun way to go.	tena fomba mahafinaritra tokoa izany
He looks good.	mijery tsara izy
These are small things.	zavatra kely ireo
Even if he doesn’t want to do it.	na dia tsy te hanao izany aza izy
Some are still uncertain.	mbola tsy misy antoka ny sasany
The essentials are exactly the same.	ny zavadehibe dia mitovy tanteraka
Now with that.	ankehitriny miaraka aminizany
It sounds fun.	toa mahafinaritra izany
The man.	ny lehilahy
But this is not wrong.	tsy diso anefa izany
It started with a very old life.	nanomboka taminny fiainana taloha ela be izany
One last thought.	hevitra kely farany
Maybe it’s for the best.	angamba ho anny tsara indrindra izany
Of course, he’s really great.	mazava ho azy fa tena lehibe izy
They both seem confused.	toa very hevitra izy roa
And so is this man.	ary koa io lehilahy io
It starts with one of my favorite places.	manomboka aminny iray aminireo toerana tiako indrindra izany
Photo by himself.	sary avy aminny tenany
But there is another reason.	misy antony hafa koa anefa
In a way like never before.	aminny fomba tsy mbola nisy toy izany teo aloha
Some people are like that.	toy izany koa ny olona sasany
He won’t lose this one either.	tsy ho very ity iray ity koa izy
Even if not for others.	na dia tsy ho anny hafa aza
There are only three of us now.	izahay telo ihany izao
I’m busy though.	be atao aho na izany aza
And you start with a small step.	ary manomboka aminny dingana kely ianao
And some, in fact.	ary ny sasany raha ny marina
There is something in it.	misy zavatra ao
So, it has to be true.	noho izany tsy maintsy ho marina izany
But this is my favorite.	fa ity no tiako indrindra
I love it too.	tiako koa ilay izy
Or, better yet, both.	na tsara kokoa izy roa
People look at themselves.	mijery ny tenany ny olona
And we do more with that.	ary manao bebe kokoa aminizany izahay
The results, yes, are delicious.	ny vokatra eny dia mahafinaritra
One thing is for sure.	zavatra iray no azo antoka
Everything needed a lot of work.	nila asa be ny zavadrehetra
It will have to come soon.	tsy maintsy ho avy tsy ho ela
Make or die.	manao na maty
Not so once.	tsy toy izany indray mandeha
Too much actually, but just fun.	betsaka loatra raha ny marina fa mahafinaritra fotsiny
For this reason, the normal part is often done.	noho izany antony izany dia matetika ny ampahany mahazatra no atao
And so, in fact, you are.	ary noho izany raha ny marina ianao
But it could be so.	mety ho toy izany anefa izy
There were none.	tsy nisy ireo
I know it’s a long way off.	fantatro fa lavitra izany
First of all, you start.	voalohany indrindra dia manomboka ianao
But you have grown up.	fa ianao efa lehibe
This is a problem for all women.	izany no olana ho anny vehivavy rehetra
But I can't do it.	saingy tsy afaka manao
Not often enough.	tsy ampy matetika
It can be a good thing or a bad thing.	mety ho zavatra tsara na ratsy izany
No, no, it’s not just the game.	tsia tsia tsy ny lalao ihany
What is.	inona ny
This may be a true misconception.	mety ho diso hevitra marina izany
He doesn't need anything else.	tsy mila zavatra hafa izy
He didn’t want to be wrong.	tsy te ho diso izy
Such a very bad approach.	fomba ratsy be toy izany
You didn't say that.	tsy nilaza izany ianao
Then he went again.	dia nandeha indray izy
It may not be there.	mety tsy ho eo izany
We don’t need that anymore.	tsy mila izany indray izahay
However, it is not as simple as it may seem.	na izany aza tsy dia tsotra araka ny mety ho hita izany
It’s like a part of you is dead.	toy ny hoe misy ampahany aminao maty
Yes, not good.	eny tsy tsara
You go for something else.	mandeha zavatra hafa ianao
He didn't need it anymore.	tsy nila izany intsony izy
It doesn’t seem like much.	toa tsy dia be loatra
It is also very far away.	lavitra be koa izy io
It's not yours, it's his, mine.	tsy anao izany fa ny azy ny ahy
If they only knew what it was.	raha mba fantany hoe inona izany
The food doesn’t last long.	tsy mandeha ela ny sakafo
Whatever the real situation.	na inona marina ny zavamisy
Not far at night.	tsy lavitra ny alina
It’s just one.	iray ihany izany
Something beautiful and crazy.	zavatra tsara tarehy sy adala
One day is the same.	indray andro dia iray ihany
I think he needs a little time.	heveriko fa mila fotoana kely izy
But you don’t get it.	fa tsy azonao
It's a nonsense word.	teny tsy misy dikany izany
Of course, this is only true.	mazava ho azy fa marina ihany izany
Will come here.	ho tonga eto
I may not have seen it.	mety tsy hitako izany
Very good at that.	tena tsara aminizany
He couldn't say why, but he did.	tsy afaka nilaza ny antony izy fa izy
You cannot do evil.	tsy afaka manao ratsy ianao
I might do it at some point.	mety hanao izany aho aminny fotoana iray
Sometimes the two are small.	indraindray kely ny roa
Two or three, in fact.	roa na telo raha ny marina
Both were not.	samy tsy nisy izany
That's enough for me.	ampy ahy izany
And then we love them.	ary avy eo dia tia azy ireo isika
In fact, it works sometimes.	raha ny marina dia miasa izany indraindray
And many of them are really good.	ary maro aminizy ireo no tena tsara
I didn’t always do that.	tsy nanao izany foana aho
I can't see what's inside.	tsy hitako ny ao anatiny
I never saw a dead face.	tsy mba nahita tarehy maty
In the game.	aminny lalao
No, do nothing.	tsia aza manao na inona na inona
They came today.	tonga izy ireo anio
It is together.	izy io dia miaraka
I will be happy with that.	ho faly aho aminizany
But they are enough.	ampy azy ireo anefa
It is very important to me.	tena ilaina ho ahy izany
So that’s all good.	ka tsara daholo izany
Nice women, both of them.	vehivavy mahafinaritra izy roa
Both things are true.	samy marina ireo zavatra roa ireo
There was nothing there.	tsy nisy na inona na inona tao
He still looks good.	toa mbola tsara ihany izy
You don’t have either.	tsy manana ianao koa
You have to have a choice in that.	tsy maintsy manana safidy ianao aminizany
They are something completely different.	zavatra hafa tanteraka izy ireo
Both are out of the question.	samy tsy misy resaka
He is the next for sure.	izy no manaraka azo antoka
They are very wrong to do so.	tena diso izy ireo manao izany
But it is too simple.	tsotra loatra anefa izany
You have something good here.	manana zavatra tsara ianao eto
But I found something.	nahita zavatra aho anefa
She really loves him.	tena tia azy izy
We went there.	nandeha tany izahay
We need to do both.	mila manao ny roa isika
The final work.	ny asa farany
There is no end to the action.	tsy misy farany ny hetsika
It seems to work.	toa miasa
They may be just like you and me.	mety ho toa ahy sy ianao ihany izy ireo
In fact, not new.	raha ny marina tsy vaovao
He was already one.	efa iray ihany izy
See all pictures.	jereo ny sary rehetra
That’s a good thing for men your age.	zavatra tsara ho anny lehilahy mitovy taona aminao izany
There was no such thing.	tsy nisy toy izany
But time is running out.	kely be anefa ny fotoana
It’s not that he was completely wrong in the past.	tsy hoe diso tanteraka izy taloha
The world never existed.	tsy nisy mihitsy izao tontolo izao
He is also very important to me.	tena zavadehibe amiko koa izy
He seemed to know the house.	toa fantany ilay trano
He works for me now.	miasa amiko izy izao
Of course, they are happy.	mazava ho azy fa faly izy ireo
That's not good.	tsy hoe tsara izany
You can't die now.	tsy mety maty ianao izao
Make time.	ataovy ny fotoana
He simply did not know.	tsy fantany tsotra izao
Just look at them.	jereo fotsiny izy ireo
It’s a quick job.	asa haingana izany
There will be no future of this thing in the future.	tsy hisy ho avy aminizany zavatra izany aminny ho avy
You came here.	tonga eto ianao
And I know.	ary fantany aho
Everyone has always said that.	efa nilaza izany hatrany ny rehetra
That’s because that’s what it is.	izany dia satria izany no izy
Without you, nothing else matters.	raha tsy misy anao dia tsy misy zavadehibe hafa
Look here now.	jereo eto izao
There are a lot of results.	be dia be ny vokatra azo
These products can be absolutely beautiful.	ireo vokatra ireo dia mety ho tsara tarehy tanteraka
Look now.	jereo izao
And he lost a lot, you know.	ary very be izy fantatrao
He, however.	izy anefa
And the people said.	ary hoy ny olona
Yes, you can too.	eny mety ho ianao koa
On less plentiful land.	aminny tany tsy dia be loatra
You know, in the end.	fantatrao aminny farany
There may be something like a distance movement.	mety misy zavatra toy ny hetsika any lavitra
I work on it.	miasa aminizany aho
Which seems bad.	izay toa ratsy
It will never work.	tsy mety miasa mihitsy izany
It has to be.	tsy maintsy ho izany
I also like people like me.	tiako koa ny olona toa ahy
Maybe it works for some, but not for me.	angamba mety ho anny sasany izany fa tsy ho ahy
You are so wrong.	tena diso hevitra ianao
I'm not wasting time.	tsy very fotoana aho
But it is gone.	efa lasa anefa izany
Whatever, man.	na inona na inona lehilahy
Sometimes you had to stop walking.	indraindray ianao dia tsy maintsy nijanona tsy nandeha
Nothing was found there.	tsy misy zavatra hita any
But he could still see.	mbola afaka nahita ihany anefa izy
But it's more fun.	mahafinaritra kokoa anefa izany
This may or may not be a problem.	mety ho olana izany na tsia
too early.	aloha loatra
This can be done in the right way.	izany dia azo atao aminny fomba mety
Yes, he is a handsome man.	eny lehilahy tsara tarehy izy
So there are many of these.	noho izany dia maro ireo
But the world is completely different.	hafa tanteraka anefa izao tontolo izao
It was just a job.	asa fotsiny ilay izy
So, it works well.	noho izany miasa tsara izy io
It’s a wonderful story.	tantara mahafinaritra izy io
It's been a long time, maybe.	efa ela angamba
It didn’t seem to go well.	toa tsy nandeha tsara izany
It’s really fun to watch.	tena mahafinaritra ny mijery
not me anymore.	tsy aho intsony
You are doing a really good job.	tena manao asa tsara ianao
I love you, but you are not mine.	tiako ianao fa tsy ahy ianao
Yes, we are here too.	eny eto koa izahay
We always did.	nanao foana izahay
I can't do anything with him.	tsy afaka manao na inona na inona aminy aho
I didn’t think much of it.	tsy dia nieritreritra loatra aho
You don't need anything from me.	tsy mila na inona na inona amiko ianao
No woman has ever done that.	tsy mbola nisy vehivavy nanao izany
But yeah, it’s great, look at the picture.	fa eny lehibe izany jereo ny sary
In fact, no one was sure.	raha ny marina tsy nisy olona azo antoka
They are both great.	samy lehibe izy ireo
The truth is, that’s all.	ny marina izay ihany
We had some really nice people there.	nanana olona tena tsara izahay tany
It had to be done quickly.	tsy maintsy natao haingana izany
Now he’s glad he didn’t.	faly izy izao fa tsy nanao izany
I had to do it all.	tsy maintsy nanao izany rehetra izany aho
The same is true.	marina koa izany
But the discussion of history is not really important to me here.	fa ny ady hevitra momba ny tantara dia tsy tena zavadehibe amiko eto
He had nothing of his own.	tsy nanana na inona na inona taminny tenany izy
And these are the first two.	ary ireo no roa voalohany
Everyone is working well.	miasa tsara ny rehetra
It will not come in the future.	tsy ho avy izany aminny ho avy
And it’s not necessary.	ary tsy ilaina izany
It is a clear night.	alina mazava tsara izao
Money is not the important thing.	tsy ny vola no zavadehibe
If he is there.	raha any izy
A classic classic story.	tantara mahazatra mahazatra
In fact, he never did.	raha ny marina dia tsy nanao izany mihitsy izy
He still hasn't got it.	mbola tsy nahazo izany izy
We did ours.	nanao ny anay izahay
We have one of the dead.	manana iray aminireo maty izahay
The money is still there.	mbola misy ny vola
There is nothing certain about it.	tsy misy zavatra azo antoka momba izany
Even one is too many.	na ny iray aza dia maro loatra
It’s from there.	avy any izany
You know he will be there, of course.	fantatrao fa ho eo izy mazava ho azy
He just saw it now.	vao nahita izany izy izao
What is to come, to come.	izay ho avy ho avy
Not because he said something stupid.	tsy hoe satria nilaza zavatra adala izy
Very nice guy.	lehilahy mahafinaritra tokoa
There is no time for anything else.	tsy misy fotoana aminny zavatra hafa
It almost seemed like he really enjoyed it.	toa saika nahafinaritra azy tokoa izany
He loves to do that stuff.	tiany ny manao izany zavatra izany
Not that it will matter to you.	tsy hoe ho zavadehibe aminao izany
I don’t know that actually.	tsy fantatro izany raha ny marina
But, it’s often too small.	saingy matetika dia kely ihany koa izany
As fast as you can.	haingana azonao atao
But only a little.	fa kely fotsiny
But it can be important.	mety ho zavadehibe anefa izany
They really need it.	tena mila izany izy ireo
Especially women have a lot to lose.	indrindra fa ny vehivavy manana be dia be ho very
There were two of us.	nisy roa izahay
But something else.	fa zavatra hafa koa
They seem new.	toa vaovao izy ireo
Lots of people.	be dia be ny olona
I love the end result.	tiako ny vokatra farany
There may be others to come.	mety hisy hafa ho avy
It is one of many.	iray aminny maro izany
Thankfully he did the right thing.	misaotra fa nanao ny marina izy
To the real world.	ho aminny tontolo tena izy
But we can do something about it.	afaka manao zavatra momba izany anefa isika
Everyone seemed happy.	toa faly ny tsirairay
The picture in the story.	ny sary ao aminny tantara
I saw the.	hitako ny
And again, and again, and again.	ary indray ary indray ary indray
He, too.	izy koa
We both had a crazy night.	alina adala izahay roa
Yes, it is the same.	eny mitovy ihany izany
I'll be here soon.	tsy ho ela eto aho
They are hard and tough in general.	mafy sy mafy izy ireo aminny ankapobeny
And no one did anything.	ary tsy nisy nanao na inona na inona
Of course, there were also negatives.	mazava ho azy fa nisy ihany koa ny ratsy
To you too.	aminao koa
We are at the end.	eo aminny farany isika
But the choice is that.	fa ny safidy dia izany
But there is nothing you can do.	saingy tsy misy na inona na inona azonao atao
Maybe it’s for him.	angamba ho azy izany
Maybe, it will be different this year.	angamba ho hafa aminity taona ity
But the problem is.	fa ny olana dia
But people may be wrong.	mety ho diso hevitra anefa ny olona
It is still a long way off.	mbola lavitra izany
This is not for you.	tsy mety aminao izany
But this is not going well.	tsy mandeha tsara anefa izany
They stopped soon.	nijanona tsy ela izy ireo
I think we lost that.	heveriko fa very izany isika
But he did not have to.	tsy nila nanao izany anefa izy
That's it.	izay izany
Often, though, that is the problem.	matetika anefa izany no olana
So it could become a lot of things.	noho izany dia mety ho lasa zavatra maro
Well, you have that reason.	eny ary manana izany antony izany ianao
Good work too.	asa tsara koa
We are in the same house.	ao aminny trano iray ihany izahay
They have more than one job.	manana asa mihoatra ny iray izy ireo
To me, all is well.	amiko dia tsara daholo
This approach is wrong.	diso izany fomba izany
You couldn't say why.	tsy afaka nilaza ny antony ianao
But it is very bad for them.	tena ratsy ho azy ireo anefa
I think sometimes we disagree with reality.	heveriko fa indraindray isika dia tsy mitovy hevitra aminny zavamisy
I love them, but I don’t like them.	tiako izy ireo saingy tsy tiako izy ireo
We have to do something, but we can’t.	tsy maintsy manao zavatra isika saingy tsy afaka
I don’t know if this is the right path.	tsy fantany raha io no lalana mety
There is one thing.	misy zavatra iray
They are more numerous than we are.	betsaka kokoa noho ny anay izy ireo
That is the reality here.	izany no zavamisy eto
Stupid thing to do.	zavatra adala atao
My man is yours.	anao ny lehilahy ahy
It is for us.	ho antsika izany
And many did.	ary maro no nanao izany
There is no question that they are real.	tsy misy fanontaniana hoe tena izy ireo
It used to be.	teo aloha izany
But we were wrong.	fa diso lalana izahay
Maybe it was his.	angamba mety ho azy izany
I love you, and always have that.	tiako ianao ary manana izany foana
I went too far.	lasa lavitra loatra aho
Which is beautiful.	izay tsara tarehy
It shouldn’t.	tsy tokony
I think you have a problem with that.	heveriko fa manana olana aminizany ianao
He is the one who really has the problem.	izy no tena manana olana
When you start something, you do it right.	rehefa manomboka zavatra ianao dia manao izany araka ny tokony ho izy
I thought about doing it again.	nieritreritra ny hanao izany indray aho
I'm just getting started.	vao manomboka aho
I hope he is right.	manantena aho fa marina izy
You can find these here and here.	azonao atao ny mahita ireo eto sy eto
He had seen it.	efa nahita izany izy
Seems very fast.	toa haingana be
In a big way.	aminny fomba lehibe
I love this woman.	tiako ity vehivavy ity
You can't walk on that.	tsy afaka mandeha aminizany ianao
Not very clear.	tsy dia mazava loatra
I think we can do something special together.	heveriko fa afaka manao zavatra manokana isika miaraka
If you are wrong for whatever reason.	raha diso ianao na inona na inona antony
The idea is, there is a place for everyone here.	ny hevitra dia hoe misy toerana ho anny rehetra eto
There are two other options.	misy safidy roa hafa
We all work on it.	miasa aminizany isika rehetra
But it really is like that.	saingy tena toy izany tokoa
This is a two -step process.	izany dia dingana roa
But it is not.	tsy izany anefa
This will continue to be true in the future.	mbola ho marina izany aminny ho avy
The work works.	miasa ny asa
But one thing is for sure.	saingy nisy zavatra iray azo antoka
They are two different things.	izy ireo dia roa samy hafa
I no longer thought.	tsy nieritreritra intsony aho
It could be us again.	mety ho antsika indray izany
He has already done so.	efa nanao izany izy
They began to rejoice there.	nanomboka faly tao izy ireo
Look at it.	mijery azy io
I did not go.	tsy nandeha aho
With a trip away from you.	miaraka aminny dia lavitra anao
It’s the fastest, right now.	io no haingana indrindra ankehitriny
He told himself that he was not alone.	nilaza ny tenany fa tsy irery izy
But not here and not now.	fa tsy eto ary tsy izao
my favorite.	tiako indrindra
You make more money.	mahazo vola bebe kokoa ianao
Which at the moment is not like that.	izay aminizao fotoana izao dia tsy toa azy
This place is great.	lehibe io toerana io
No one has it any easier.	tsy misy olona manana izany mora kokoa fotsiny
I think it went well.	heveriko fa nandeha tsara izany
It’s so easy now.	mora tokoa izany ankehitriny
He is no longer human.	tsy olona intsony izy
Then came the usual work.	avy eo dia tonga ny asa mahazatra
But no one can see that.	tsy misy afaka mahita izany anefa
Either way, they died.	na izany na tsy izany dia maty izy ireo
This may not be easy for you.	mety tsy ho mora aminao izany
And some are really beautiful.	ary ny sasany dia tena tsara tarehy
More than that.	mihoatra noho izay hita
It was the most fun.	io no tena nahafinaritra indrindra
But the best is yet to come.	saingy mbola ho avy ny tsara indrindra
Either way, this is how it goes.	na izany na tsy izany dia izao no mandeha
They got it.	nahazo izany izy ireo
It was made for me.	natao ho ahy io
And we will.	ary hanao izany isika
As such.	toy izany
He knows it now.	fantany izany ankehitriny
And all that is enough.	ary izany rehetra izany dia ampy
And then, that’s fine.	ary avy eo tsara izany
They don't even work for themselves.	tsy miasa ho anny tenany akory izy ireo
It works better when available.	miasa tsara kokoa izy io rehefa misy
Many people were unemployed.	betsaka ny olona tsy nanana asa
I have to do it.	tsy maintsy manao izany aho
I would love to see it.	tiako ny mahita anio
Good food too.	sakafo tsara koa
Do it as appropriate.	manao izany ho toy ny mety
It’s fun to watch.	mahafinaritra ny mijery izany
And it looks good, too.	ary toa tsara koa izany
The latter fact is important.	zavadehibe ny zavamisy farany
It's a job.	asa io
The same is true.	izany koa no marina
It looks real.	toa ny tena izy
Yes, sometimes it’s hard to walk.	eny sarotra indraindray ny mandeha
Take a quick look.	jereo haingana ianao
I love the work.	tiako ny asa
It works the same on all issues.	miasa mitovy aminny olana rehetra izany
It is also difficult.	sarotra koa izany
Then the next step is easy to do.	avy eo dia mora ny nanao ny dingana manaraka
If he has one, he said.	raha manana iray izy hoy izy
It was really bad.	tena ratsy ilay izy
It’s not just about them.	tsy ny momba azy ireo fotsiny
This can be done in two ways.	azo atao aminny fomba roa izany
I can do what I enjoy.	afaka manao izay mahafinaritra ahy aho
Not the inside, actually.	tsy ny ao anatiny raha ny marina
Of course, this is very bad.	mazava ho azy fa tena ratsy be izany
As they are now.	toy ny nisy azy ireo ankehitriny
But there is no time yet.	saingy tsy mbola misy fotoana
This is not bad !.	tsy ratsy izany
He seems safe.	toa azo antoka izy
So at all times and therefore.	noho izany aminny fotoana rehetra sy noho izany
He had never seen anything like them.	mbola tsy nahita toa azy ireo mihitsy izy
There is only hard work.	asa mafy ihany no misy
About them all.	ny momba azy ireo rehetra
It is not lost yet.	tsy mbola very izany
We are superior.	ambony isika
Or just one.	na iray ihany
It’s just not a really fun way.	tsy fomba tena mahafinaritra fotsiny izany
He was just telling the truth.	nilaza ny marina fotsiny izy
Not too long.	tsy tena ela
Good and bad news for me.	vaovao tsara sy ratsy ho ahy
He does not want you to be happy.	tsy tiany ho faly ianao
These three in general can be difficult.	ireo telo ireo aminny ankapobeny dia mety ho sarotra
But they never came.	tsy tonga mihitsy anefa izy ireo
If you really love it, be happy.	raha tena tia ianao dia faly aminizany
A great place to work.	toerana mahafinaritra ny miasa
Or maybe two or three.	na angamba roa na telo
Great place for a fun game.	toerana tsara ho anny lalao mahafinaritra
It was a familiar land.	tany mahazatra ilay izy
Two men, and two women.	lehilahy roa ary vehivavy roa
He goes fast though.	mandeha haingana izy na izany aza
He was indeed there.	teo tokoa izy
The location was good and the food was delicious.	tsara ny toerana ary nahafinaritra ny sakafo
Yes, it takes time.	eny mila fotoana izany
He looked around, and saw nothing.	nijery manodidina izy ary tsy nahita na inona na inona
But no words came.	saingy tsy nisy teny tonga
He never told her again that he loved her.	tsy nilaza taminy intsony izy fa tia azy
In fact, we have the following product.	raha ny marina dia manana izao vokatra manaraka izao isika
Simple maybe but not easy.	tsotra angamba fa tsy mora
Night follows day and night follows day.	ny alina manaraka ny andro ary ny alina manaraka ny andro
But ideas first.	fa hevitra aloha
In those days, that was one thing.	taminizany andro izany zavatra iray izany
In many ways.	aminny fomba maro
I know someone can do that to me.	fantatro fa misy olona afaka manao izany amiko
We are all different.	samy hafa isika rehetra
Just far away.	lavitra fotsiny
It was a great time.	tena nahafinaritra ilay fotoana
However, it is not the most reliable.	na izany aza dia tsy azo antoka indrindra
He will never be.	tsy ho izany mihitsy izy
But he is not always bad.	tsy ratsy foana anefa izy
He always works hard.	miasa mafy foana izy
So is life.	tsy izany koa ny fiainana
It was not easy for him.	tsy mora taminy izany
Not now, of course.	tsy izao mazava ho azy
I don't see much.	tsy dia hitako loatra
You don’t know what you’re missing.	tsy fantatrao izay tsy ampy anao
Maybe he’s really on top.	angamba tena any ambony izy
This is my favorite one.	ity no iray no tiako indrindra
Because you can't.	satria tsy afaka
Yes, and he told me.	eny ary nilaza tamiko izy
And he does.	dia manao izany izy
I need something else.	mila zavatra hafa aho
It’s always good to be simple.	tsara foana ny tsotra
And he had to.	ary tsy maintsy nanao izany izy
Just another death.	maty hafa ihany
This is the real thing.	izany no tena izy
And we will be better than that.	ary ho tsara kokoa noho izany isika
The bad days he had.	ny andro ratsy nahazo azy
There are a lot of big issues.	betsaka ny olana lehibe
The idea was great.	nahafinaritra ny hevitra
I don’t think we do that.	heveriko fa tsy manao izany isika
This is also wrong.	diso koa izany
Sometimes it’s hard to do more than that.	indraindray dia sarotra ny manao mihoatra noho izany
Not so today.	tsy izany koa ankehitriny
Or they can do both.	na afaka manao ny roa izy ireo
And you just know.	ary fantatrao fotsiny
They didn’t have a pleasant conversation.	tsy nanao resaka mahafinaritra izy ireo
Not the work.	tsy ny asa
In fact, it is all of us.	raha ny marina dia antsika rehetra izany
I know there will be more.	fantatro fa mbola hisy bebe kokoa
And others who did not.	ary ny hafa izay tsy nanao izany
You don’t follow one.	tsy manaraka ny iray ianao
Really good job with both of them.	tena asa tsara miaraka aminizy roa
especially for us.	manokana ho antsika
We were in a difficult place.	tao aminny toerana sarotra izahay
I love the best.	tiako ny tsara indrindra
This is not a game.	tsy lalao ity
There you look good.	ao ianao toa tsara
He could not walk.	tsy afaka nandeha izy
You can only do what you can.	izay azonao atao ihany no azonao atao
The work, of course, is different.	ny asa mazava ho azy dia hafa
I don't agree with that.	tsy mitovy hevitra aminizany aho
But then she was very beautiful.	fa tsara tarehy be izy avy eo
Not one day.	tsy indray andro
Of course, money matters.	mazava ho azy fa ny vola no zavadehibe ao
The man looked up.	nijery ilay lehilahy
No, not an idea.	tsia tsy hevitra iray akory
But not as much as possible.	saingy tsy araka izay azo atao
I think that’s true sometimes.	heveriko fa marina izany indraindray
He looks like a handsome man.	toa lehilahy tsara tarehy izy
No more bad stories.	tsy misy tantara ratsy intsony
Yes, there is a part of it.	eny misy ampahany aminizany
It was much harder than before.	sarotra lavitra noho ny teo aloha ilay izy
Nothing was good at all.	tsy nisy zavatra tsara mihitsy
The house was full of earth, and the parts were low.	feno tany ny trano ary ambany ny ampahany
It really doesn’t make sense.	tena tsy misy dikany
Then he is.	avy eo izy
But it doesn’t make much sense here.	tsy dia misy dikany loatra anefa izany eto
They are often the most effective products.	matetika izy ireo no tena vokatra tsara
Well, a small part of it.	eny ary ampahany kely aminizany
That alone, however, is not enough.	izay ihany anefa dia tsy ampy
Of course, this is a never -ending battle.	mazava ho azy fa ady tsy misy farany izany
You will be there.	ho eo ianao
Very hard.	mafy dia mafy
I still need them.	mbola mila azy ireo aho
We did that and they were needed first.	nanao izany izahay ary tena ilaina aloha izy ireo
No one came for us.	tsy nisy olona tonga ho anay
And there it was,.	ary teo izany
However, it seems like a lot.	na izany aza toa be dia be izany
These are all jobs.	asa daholo ireo
I don’t seem to deserve it.	toa tsy mendrika azy aho
It seems like everything and the end.	toa ny zavadrehetra ary ny farany
No, we will not.	tsia tsy hanao izany izahay
When they saw the first one, it seemed to be everywhere.	rehefa nahita ilay voalohany izy ireo dia toa teny rehetra teny
He seems to be such a person.	toa olona toy izany izy
Or misplaced.	na diso toerana
And many more.	ary maro hafa koa
The results are not good.	tsy tsara ny vokatra
I don't want to go there.	tsy te ho any aho
They are always here.	eto foana izy ireo
There is both right and wrong.	samy tsy misy marina ary tsy misy diso
I like it now.	tiako izao
Not many can.	tsy maro no afaka
Like me new.	toy ny ahy vaovao
You are coming now.	ho avy ianao izao
Or, yes, you get the idea.	na eny azonao ny hevitra
Something small, simple.	zavatra kely tsotra
There is something else to it.	mbola misy zavatra hafa aminizany
And these are fun.	ary mahafinaritra ireo
He might have something there.	mety manana zavatra izy any
Not too big, not too small.	tsy lehibe loatra tsy kely loatra
Right now, he didn’t have anything he liked.	aminizao fotoana izao dia tsy nanana zavatra tiany izy
But words work.	fa ny teny miasa
There is a next path.	misy lalana manaraka
There was war.	teo ny ady
It will be better and worse.	ho tsara sy ratsy kokoa
I can't find a car.	tsy mahita fiara aho
Nothing to do.	tsy misy atao
Maybe nothing.	angamba tsy misy na inona na inona
The car is gone.	lasa ilay fiara
Types of food.	karazana sakafo
And it’s just as good.	ary tsara toy izany
I hope he becomes one.	manantena aho fa ho lasa iray izy
I think you might do worse.	heveriko fa mety hanao ratsy kokoa ianao
Not all difficult words are difficult.	tsy ny teny sarotra rehetra no sarotra
We are happy to see him.	faly izahay mahita azy
Now for the other end.	ankehitriny ho anny farany hafa
People saw something.	nahita zavatra ny olona
It’s still not easy but it’s possible.	mbola tsy mora mihitsy fa azo atao
Lots of beautiful things.	be dia be ny tsara tarehy
But he has yet to see anything.	saingy mbola tsy nahita na inona na inona izy
It’s just a good job.	asa tsara fotsiny io
Maybe someone will be there soon.	mety hisy olona ho any tsy ho ela
There may be good things.	mety hisy zavatra tsara
I don't see what to lose.	tsy hitako izay ho very
I really don’t know.	tena tsy fantatro mihitsy
But no, we are.	saingy tsia isika
It’s something.	zavatra izany
There was nothing in it.	tsy nisy na inona na inona tao aminy
As a result, he died.	noho izany dia maty izy
Then the game begins.	dia manomboka ny lalao
Right now, you don’t have that option.	aminizao fotoana izao tsy manana izany safidy izany ianao
Expect a safer world.	manantena tontolo azo antoka kokoa
But that may not be enough.	mety tsy ho ampy anefa izany
It really looks like it.	tena toa azy io
Something for everyone.	zavatra ho anny rehetra
He is not yours.	tsy anao izy
He was there.	tao izy
It may be so.	mety ho izany no izy
They always had.	nanana foana izy ireo
He also started walking.	nanomboka nandeha koa izy
Too good to be true.	tsara loatra raha marina
But we saw them.	fa nahita azy ireo izahay
There are no words for him.	tsy misy teny ho azy
It can be easy and automatic.	mety ho mora sy mandeha ho azy izany
In fact, it simply isn’t.	raha ny marina dia tsy izany tsotra izao
Not too bad.	tsy tena ratsy
As you know by now, this is not the case.	araka ny efa fantatrao izao dia tsy izany no izy
And his too.	ary ny azy koa
We can go when the time comes.	afaka mandeha isika rehefa tonga ny fotoana
I don't even see what's to come.	tsy hitako akory izay ho avy
This is for the following reason.	izany dia noho ny antony manaraka
It's ours, ours.	azy io ny antsika
For us, however, for me.	ho antsika na izany aza ho ahy
He is with one or two others.	miaraka aminny iray na roa hafa izy
Sometimes it is the same.	toy izany koa izy indraindray
Everything seemed to go well.	toa nandeha tsara ny zavadrehetra
So we must have or, similarly,.	noho izany dia tsy maintsy manana na mitovy aminizany
No, that's really crazy.	tsia tena adala izany
I think that's what it is.	heveriko fa izay no izy
Some of these require money.	mila vola ny sasany aminireo
I see life.	hitako ny fiainana
These are good ideas.	hevitra tsara ireo
He had been there before.	efa tany izy taloha
Not in this house.	tsy aminity trano ity
So, for us.	noho izany ho antsika
We are all the same now.	mitovy daholo isika izao
Here we get the same amount of money.	eto isika dia mahazo vola mitovy
Couldn't do it.	tsy afaka nanao izany
And of course, timing is the most important thing.	ary mazava ho azy ny fotoana no tena zavadehibe
This is the first.	ity no voalohany
And they are very good.	ary tena tsara izy ireo
There are a lot of them around us.	betsaka izy ireo eto aminny manodidina anay
What’s worse is that it all makes no sense.	ny tena ratsy dia tsy misy dikany izany rehetra izany
He always wanted to do good.	te hanao zavatra tsara foana izy
This is not the best way to come.	tsy io no fomba tonga tsara indrindra
But it’s all about the same thing, basically.	fa izy rehetra dia momba ny zavatra iray ihany aminny ankapobeny
Works well, everything is going well.	miasa tsara mandeha tsara ny zavadrehetra
All is well.	tsara daholo ny rehetra
Not the game at all.	tsy ny lalao mihitsy
Not yet, and probably not yet.	tsy mbola ary angamba tsy mbola
He came.	tonga izy
They weren't there much.	tsy dia tao izy ireo
None of these things are true today.	tsy misy marina ireo zavatra ireo ankehitriny
I think this world might need us.	heveriko fa mety mila antsika ity tontolo ity
And the other part.	ary ny ampahany hafa
But that seems very difficult.	toa sarotra be anefa izany
I don’t like to see him like that.	tsy tiako ny mahita azy toy izany
It’s definitely fast.	azo antoka fa haingana izany
We are one person.	olona iray ihany isika
There is nothing for him.	tsy misy na inona na inona ho azy
It can be ugly.	mety ho ratsy tarehy izany
Nothing else.	tsy misy zavatra hafa

This man is very familiar.	tena mahazatra anio lehilahy io
But more people can do it than they do now.	saingy betsaka kokoa ny olona afaka manao izany noho ny manao izany ankehitriny
We have always done that.	efa nanao izany foana izahay
The day is always day.	andro foana ny andro
If one thing is the same, it is the same.	raha mitovy ny zavatra iray dia iray ihany
The big, the small and the big.	ny lehibe ny kely ary ny lehibe
Not in any way.	tsy aminny fomba rehetra

It’s not a hard game, but it’s really tough.	tsy lalao sarotra izany fa tena mafy
One step, then another.	dingana iray avy eo hafa

He said the man was dead.	nilaza izy fa maty ilay lehilahy
We don’t have a full day.	tsy manana tontolo andro izahay
There was also no one.	tsy nisy koa ny iray
The movement is only part of the war.	ampahany aminny ady ihany ny hetsika
Time is running out.	lasa ny fotoana
Both are no longer obvious, or very important.	samy tsy hita mazava loatra intsony na tena zavadehibe
And you love me.	ary tia ahy ianao
In fact, it is like.	raha ny marina dia toy ny
I liked him.	nahafinaritra ahy izy

Here you do not need a car.	eto ianao dia tsy mila fiara
And so these stories.	ary noho izany ireo tantara ireo
I am not a good man.	tsy lehilahy tsara aho
That sounds bad.	toa ratsy izany
He has to start right away.	tsy maintsy manomboka avy hatrany izy
Both are unclear.	samy tsy misy mazava ny resaka
And we are all very happy.	ary faly be izahay rehetra
Make sure you know what you want.	ataovy azo antoka fa fantatrao izay tianao
Only you had a choice.	ianao irery no nanana safidy

It was a great day !.	tena nahafinaritra ny andro
But we did.	nanao izany anefa izahay
There was a little problem.	nisy olana kely
I prefer real food.	tiako kokoa ny tena sakafo
I'm still far away.	mbola lavitra ny ahy
A long time has passed.	fotoana ela be no lasa
Now it is not.	ankehitriny dia tsy izany
I have come a long way.	efa tonga lavitra aho
But it can easily be done with something like that.	saingy azo atao mora foana aminny zavatra toy izany
Yes, that is not an idea at all.	eny tsy hevitra mihitsy izany
This is also fun.	ity koa dia mahafinaritra
Like around the house.	toy ny manodidina ny trano
Some do today.	misy manao anio
There was no real money there.	tsy nisy vola tena izy teo
It really doesn’t make sense to me.	tena tsy misy dikany amiko izany
Fast, fast, fastest.	haingana haingana haingana indrindra
It will be beautiful.	ho tsara tarehy izy io
There is no way to be without a part.	tsy misy fomba ho tsy misy ampahany
Look closest to you.	jereo ny akaiky anao indrindra
He got the worse end.	nahazo ny farany ratsy kokoa izy
Inside, there was a variety of activities.	tao anatiny dia nisy karazana hetsika
Now, look at me.	ankehitriny jereo aho
Now they were there.	ankehitriny dia teo izy ireo
It's easy now.	mora izao
None of the above.	tsy misy eo ambony
And nothing wrong was done.	ary tsy nisy ratsy natao
This is often a difficult task.	matetika dia asa sarotra izany
For the first time, this is not bad.	ho anny voalohany dia tsy ratsy izany
It should be for me.	tokony ho ahy io
It doesn’t make much sense.	tsy misy dikany loatra
They are just people.	olona fotsiny izy ireo
It’s a matter of conversation.	resaka resaka io

Definitely one for you.	tena iray ho anao

It’s exactly the same, but whatever.	mitovy tanteraka izany fa na inona na inona
They are watching.	mijery izy ireo
You are nothing.	tsy inona ianao

It still exists.	mbola misy foana izany
There was no money.	tsy nisy ny vola
It’s hard to do that sometimes.	sarotra ny manao izany indraindray
Currently, they do not exist.	aminizao fotoana izao dia tsy misy izy ireo
I might do something like this.	mety hanao zavatra toy izao aho
The current action is, of course, meaningless.	ny hetsika ankehitriny dia mazava ho azy fa tsy misy dikany
You haven't seen anything yet.	mbola tsy nahita na inona na inona ianao
In fact, everyone should be here soon.	raha ny marina tokony ho eto tsy ho ela ny rehetra
And now it is not.	ary ankehitriny tsy izany

That idea didn't make sense to me at all.	tsy nisy dikany tamiko mihitsy izany hevitra izany
It’s like seeing it.	toy ny mahita izany
It is easy to understand.	mora azo izany
Samy mora.	samy mora
I’m glad it is.	faly aho fa izy io
I’ve had it before.	efa nanana izany aho taloha
He enjoyed it at first.	nahafinaritra azy ilay izy taminny voalohany
It doesn’t make much sense.	tsy misy dikany loatra izany
It should be simpler than that.	tokony ho tsotra kokoa noho izany
And it’s the same with an event.	ary mitovy aminny hetsika iray
But he was there, no matter what about him.	teo anefa izy na inona na inona momba azy
I love it all.	tiako daholo izany
Both alone.	samy irery
Something had to be done.	nisy zavatra tsy maintsy natao
It’s fun but a bit difficult.	mahafinaritra fa somary sarotra
Age is one reason.	antony iray ny taona
The same was true in previous years.	toy izany koa taminny taona taloha
Because you did it last.	satria ianao no nanao izany farany
But it doesn’t make sense.	saingy tsy misy dikany izy
But that is not the problem for them.	tsy izany anefa no olana ho azy ireo
But the picture is more complicated than that.	saingy sarotra kokoa noho io ny sary
Overall, he is very happy with it.	aminny ankapobeny tena faly aminizany izy
He had never seen her like that before.	mbola tsy nahita azy toy izany mihitsy izy taloha
For women, it doesn’t make sense.	aminny vehivavy dia tsy misy dikany izany
He had a beautiful home.	nanana trano tsara tarehy izy

Will come again and often.	ho tonga indray ary matetika
It's also easier.	mora kokoa koa ilay izy

I went faster.	nandeha haingana kokoa aho
But that’s the way it is now.	fa izany no fomba misy aminizao fotoana izao
I really love you and need you.	tena tiako ianao ary mila anao
He didn't look at her.	tsy nijery azy izy
You can do this in two places.	azonao atao aminny toerana roa izany
He is doing something stupid.	manao zavatra adala izy
This is where the potential lies.	io no toerana misy ny mety
This is also very important.	tena zavadehibe koa izany
He just has you.	manana anao fotsiny izy
We may have at this stage.	mety manana aminity dingana ity isika
Apparently he is not alone.	toa tsy izy irery angamba
And the war is taking a new step.	ary ny ady dia manao dingana vaovao
This is a difficult thing.	zavatra sarotra izany
He does not make choices for himself.	tsy manao safidy ho azy manokana izy
They were a problem then, they are a problem now.	olana izy ireo taminizany olana izy ireo ankehitriny
And more and more.	ary bebe kokoa hatrany
He alone.	izy irery
He really didn't see anything.	tsy nahita na inona na inona tokoa izy
I think you have one.	heveriko fa manana iray ianao
To be full of food.	mba ho feno sakafo
I can't see him.	tsy hitako izy
You need to go somewhere else.	mila mandeha hafa ianao
It can be very easy.	mety ho tena mora izany
Apparently, they were wrong about that as well.	hita fa diso hevitra momba izany koa izy ireo
In fact, it will come.	raha ny marina dia ho avy izany
Otherwise, he might go completely insane.	raha tsy izany dia mety ho lasa adala tanteraka izy
We are now real.	lasa tena misy isika izao
And he looked at him.	dia nijery azy izy
This often seems like a bad thing.	matetika dia toa zavatra ratsy izany
Nothing is more difficult.	tsy misy zavatra sarotra kokoa
So we have to work on something more general.	noho izany dia tsy maintsy miasa aminny zavatra ankapobeny kokoa isika
You really have more options.	tena manana safidy bebe kokoa ianao
No one liked the game better.	tsy nisy olona tia kokoa ny lalao
It just seems crazy.	toa adala fotsiny
I wish it didn’t do anything.	tiako fa tsy nanao na inona na inona izany
Just get two.	mahazo roa fotsiny
There are no ups and downs.	tsy misy ambony sy ambany
We are the only ones here.	isika irery no eto
The land existed.	ny tany nisy
Above.	eto ambony
He had to do this often.	tsy maintsy nanao izany matetika izy
It is necessary to go.	ilaina ny mandeha
Not at all.	tsy aminizao rehetra izao
And the night.	ary ny alina
And there was no such thing.	dia tsy nisy toy izany
It shouldn’t make sense.	tsy tokony hisy dikany izany
I can't do anything like this.	tsy afaka manao zavatra toy izao aho
It wasn’t made for me.	tsy natao ho ahy izany
It’s a great time, man.	fotoana lehibe izany lehilahy
Then he came.	dia tonga izy
So no problem.	ka tsy misy olana
So he saw it too.	ka dia nahita izany koa izy
I'm really into him.	tena ho azy aho
More to come soon.	mbola ho avy tsy ho ela
Maybe not all, but some.	mety tsy ny rehetra fa ny sasany
But yes, it was fun.	saingy eny nahafinaritra izany
I know you and I already love you.	fantatro ianao ary efa tiako ianao
The world has gone crazy.	lasa adala izao tontolo izao
This is because there was not one.	izany dia satria tsy nisy na dia iray aza
You should have no problem.	tsy tokony hisy olana aminao
It's so ugly.	tena ratsy tarehy izany
History is, in the end, what matters.	ny tantara dia aminny farany ny zavadehibe
It was fun to watch.	nahafinaritra ny nijery azy io
I have another life.	manana fiainana hafa aho
But he has me.	fa manana ahy izy
What is yours ?.	inona ny anao
He is too full.	feno loatra izy
The road is not the problem.	tsy ny lalana no olana
He had never seen her before.	mbola tsy nahita azy mihitsy izy
He loves us both.	samy tia antsika izy
Especially the one thing.	indrindra fa ilay zavatra iray
That doesn’t seem to be enough.	toa tsy ampy izany
He didn't need time.	tsy nila fotoana izy
We all did that then.	samy nanao izany isika rehetra taminizany
He had watched it.	efa nijery izany izy
Certainly not always.	ny azo antoka fa tsy foana
But not so fast.	saingy tsy dia haingana
It’s not hard to find it.	tsy sarotra ny mahita azy
Time alone.	fotoana irery
And it could be bigger than one.	ary mety ho lehibe kokoa noho ny iray
Nothing too big.	tsy misy zavatra lehibe loatra
So, he’s not stupid.	noho izany tsy adala izy
They are both beautiful.	samy tsara tarehy izy ireo
The process is very fast.	tena haingana ny dingana
It takes time.	mila fotoana izany
I know it sounds crazy.	fantatro fa toa adala
But yes, he has an idea.	saingy eny manana hevitra izy
They do, but not only that.	manao izany izy ireo fa tsy izany ihany
In fact, they can’t.	raha ny marina tsy afaka izy ireo
He is three years old.	telo taona izy
There are a lot of really good things that are really good.	betsaka ny zavatra tena tsara izay tena tsara
And more to come.	ary mbola ho avy
I know very little.	kely ihany no fantatro
If you were different.	raha mba hafa ianao
It all seems too good to be true.	toa tsara loatra izany rehetra izany raha tsy marina
Then he looked at himself.	dia nijery ny tenany izy
There was not a single mistake and he now had it.	tsy nisy diso na dia iray aza ary izy izao no nanana azy
I look down again.	mijery ambany indray aho
I also think you know those two things.	heveriko koa fa fantatrao ireo zavatra roa ireo
He seems to be a good man for the neighborhood.	toa lehilahy tsara ho anny manodidina izy
A woman is never right for her.	ny vehivavy iray dia tsy mety ho azy mihitsy
The idea is the same.	mitovy ny hevitra
It is no different today.	tsy misy hafa aminizao andro izao
But they found a way.	saingy nahita fomba izy ireo
He doesn't like these people either.	tsy tiany koa ireo olona ireo
I am bad at everything else.	ratsy aminny zavatra hafa rehetra aho
I’m glad we did.	faly aho fa nanao izany izahay
Then it’s all yours.	dia anao daholo izy
A word or two.	teny iray na roa
He had never seen such a beautiful person.	mbola tsy nahita olona tsara tarehy toy izany izy
I will not come to that question.	tsy ho tonga aminizany fanontaniana izany aho
It's just a problem.	olana fotsiny izany
The small parts, some really pretty big.	ny ampahany kely kely ny sasany tena tsara tarehy lehibe
He now had money for himself.	nanana vola ho azy izy izao
There is no time for that.	tsy misy fotoana izany
So it had to go.	ka tsy maintsy nandeha izany
It was made for me.	natao ho ahy izany
There was a time.	nisy fotoana izany
It just took time.	nila fotoana fotsiny izany
A very beautiful woman.	vehivavy tena tsara tarehy
This is especially true here.	marina indrindra izany eto
It’s hard to do anything good about it.	sarotra ny manao zavatra tsara aminizany
It’s like he could be really bad.	toy ny hoe mety ho tena ratsy izy
This is a big problem for the following reason.	olana lehibe izany noho ity antony manaraka ity
Like never before.	toy ny tsy mbola nisy
Everything works well.	miasa tsara daholo
I have enough problems.	manana olana ampy aho
Yes, to me it seems so.	eny ho ahy toa izany
But then he disappeared.	saingy tsy hita intsony izy avy eo
I don’t want anyone to blame me for them.	tsy tiako hisy ho diso ahy ho azy ireo
Especially when you’re walking in a land with no roads.	indrindra rehefa mandeha aminny tany tsy misy lalana ianao
It’s not easy but it’s well worth it.	tsy mora fa tena mendrika izany
Even if they don’t.	na dia tsy izy ireo aza
I had to see that last thing.	tsy maintsy nahita anio zavatra farany io aho
More products for you.	vokatra bebe kokoa ho anao
I was really good at it.	tena tsara aho taminizany
Maybe he really had a choice.	angamba nanana safidy tokoa izy
I know the man.	fantatro ilay lehilahy
It’s for everyone, even if nothing else.	ho anny rehetra izany na tsy misy na inona na inona
But it all works.	saingy miasa daholo izany
That is in the end.	izany dia aminny farany
Even if it’s too much.	na dia be loatra aza izany
This is the least.	izany no kely indrindra
I really don’t like it anymore.	tena tsy tiako izany indray
The game went really well.	nandeha tsara dia tsara ny lalao
There were very nice people.	nisy olona nahafinaritra be
And another year.	ary taona iray hafa
They will not.	tsy hanao izany izy ireo
In.	aminny
That's me.	izany no ahy
First of all, it’s kind of bad.	voalohany indrindra karazana ratsy izany
You may even know him.	mety ho efa fantatrao aza izy
Of course yes.	mazava ho azy fa eny
He wants to be in the best place possible.	te ho eo aminny toerana tsara indrindra azo atao izy
He did, but not for long.	nanao izany izy saingy tsy ela
He now knows everything.	fantany ny zavadrehetra izao
So that's it.	ka izay izany
And then, no.	ary avy eo tsy nisy
So, the best thing is the truth.	noho izany ny zavatra tsara indrindra dia ny marina
Someone did these things.	nisy olona nanao ireo zavatra ireo
He could have thought faster.	afaka nieritreritra haingana kokoa izy
It was a great time for him.	fotoana lehibe ho azy izany
However, this is the worst thing you can do.	na izany aza ity no zavatra ratsy indrindra azonao atao
Everything about this game seems so fun.	toa mahafinaritra be ny zavadrehetra momba ity lalao ity
So that's it.	ka izay no
But it can be more difficult.	mety ho sarotra kokoa anefa izany
He started the war.	nanomboka ny ady izy
But that is a reality today.	tena zavamisy ankehitriny anefa izany
You can, or of course.	azonao atao na mazava ho azy
This is the one for me.	ity no iray ho ahy
I just watched the fight.	vao nijery ny ady aho
It really looks like this to me.	toa ahy tokoa ity
There were many problems.	nisy olana maro
We really did.	tena nanao izany izahay
You have no home, and little money.	tsy manana trano ianao ary kely ny vola
It should be about it.	tokony ho momba azy io
Saw the others there.	nahita ny hafa teo
He stopped, confused and unsure.	nijanona izy very hevitra ary tsy azo antoka
He had a full and wonderful day.	nanana andro feno sy nahafinaritra izy
He wanted it for himself.	tiany ho azy izany
But it’s a little too much.	saingy kely dia kely izany
They are even lower.	mbola ambany kokoa izy ireo
And he didn't think to do it.	ary tsy nieritreritra ny hanao izany izy
And that goes two ways.	ary izany dia mandeha aminny lalana roa
all day.	tontolo andro
But not always.	saingy tsy izany foana
I don't want to.	tsy te
And traveled.	ary nanao dia
I expect more from you.	manantena bebe kokoa avy aminao aho
We disagree with both of them.	tsy mitovy hevitra aminizy roa ireo izahay
Then he looked at me first.	dia nijery ahy voalohany
But there is more here.	mbola betsaka kokoa anefa ny eto
Doing well, he told me.	manao tsara hoy izy tamiko
He does more.	manao bebe kokoa izy
I really love him.	tena tia azy tokoa
What a car.	fiara inona
The man looked at her once.	nijery azy indray mandeha ilay lehilahy
It may not be a big deal to me.	mety tsy ho zavatra lehibe izany amiko
And we start again.	ary manomboka indray isika
He didn't know any of them.	tsy fantany na dia iray aza
And he knows better too.	ary fantany tsara kokoa koa
It only takes two.	afaka roa ihany izany
That’s all for today.	izay ihany no ho anny anio
I'm happy for him too.	faly aminy koa aho
We are still new.	mbola vaovao izahay
I think that’s good for me.	heveriko fa tsara ho ahy izany
But one of them works well.	saingy ny iray aminizy ireo dia miasa tsara
But something could happen.	mety hisy zavatra anefa
That’s it, of course.	izany no izy mazava ho azy
The first part is very clear.	ny ampahany voalohany dia mazava tsara
Everything will be better.	ho tsara kokoa ny rehetra
I love this one.	tiako ity iray ity
I never said that.	tsy nilaza izany mihitsy aho
But you are doing very well.	tena mandeha tsara anefa ianao
But that is no longer possible.	tsy azo atao intsony anefa izany
It seems so far away.	toa lavitra be izao
There are so many good things about him.	be dia be ny zavatra tsara momba azy
I know no one likes him, but still.	fantatro fa tsy misy olona tia azy saingy na izany aza
And if that is true.	ary raha marina izany
If not now, it won’t be long.	raha tsy izao dia tsy ho ela
They are wrong and we are right.	diso izy ireo ary marina isika
He stayed where he was.	nijanona teo aminny nisy azy izy
But sometimes things go wrong.	saingy mandeha ny zavatra indraindray
This is not really a war story.	tsy tena tantara momba ny ady akory izany
Maybe everything was there.	angamba nisy ny zavadrehetra
This is not usually a problem.	tsy olana izany matetika
He will never be like that again.	tsy ho toy izany intsony izy
He can't do that.	tsy afaka manao izany izy
The car is not bad either.	tsy ratsy koa ny fiara
So we go the other way.	noho izany dia mandeha aminny fomba hafa isika
But, then again, maybe that’s it.	saingy avy eo indray angamba izany
I had an idea about him.	nanana hevitra aho momba azy
But of course that doesn’t always go that way.	saingy mazava ho azy fa tsy mandeha aminizany foana izany
Do it for yourself either.	ataovy ho anao na
The choice is his.	ho azy ny safidy
Like this.	toy izao
He doesn’t.	tsy manao izany izy
Still working on the same problem.	mbola miasa aminny olana mitovy
Now that could be a good game.	aminizao fotoana izao dia mety ho lalao tsara izany
Don’t get that idea.	aza mahazo izany hevitra izany
We will both do it.	samy hanao izany isika
There was too much.	be loatra ny tao
Even you see it.	na ianao aza mahita izany
To me, you are all that matters.	amiko dia ianao no zavadehibe rehetra
Well, that’s about it.	eny ary izany no momba izany
They’re just fun.	mahafinaritra fotsiny izy ireo
Thanks to all of us again.	misaotra antsika rehetra indray
But he thought too much of her.	nieritreritra azy be loatra anefa izy
This idea is simply wrong.	diso tsotra izao io hevitra io
More than ever.	mihoatra noho ny taloha
That’s a lot for me.	be dia be ho ahy izany
But this is a good story.	saingy tantara tsara ity
At other times as well.	aminny fotoana hafa koa
So, at first.	noho izany taminny voalohany
I know it works for you.	fantatro fa mety aminao izany
The meaning is also strong.	mafy koa ny dikany
They are acting crazy.	manao adala izy ireo
Whether you do it or not.	na hanao izany ianao na tsia
But there is no such thing there.	saingy tsy misy toy izany any
It all seems fun.	toa mahafinaritra izany rehetra izany
Of course, that is the case.	mazava ho azy fa izany no izy
One woman simply died.	vehivavy iray no maty tsotra izao
So, we don’t have to start from the beginning.	noho izany tsy mila manomboka aminny voalohany isika
I don’t like to love words either.	tsy tiako ny tia ny teny koa
A bigger step.	dingana iray lehibe kokoa
He wanted to do it alone.	te hanao izany irery izy
I just have to come.	tsy maintsy tonga fotsiny aho
It seems to be the last, too.	toa ny farany koa
He stopped when he saw us.	nijanona izy rehefa nahita anay
He already had enough.	efa nanana ny ampy izy
Our place today is different.	hafa ny toerana misy antsika ankehitriny
You have nothing to do with it.	tsy misy na inona na inona aminao miaraka aminao
If any.	raha misy
Both were never done.	samy tsy nisy natao mihitsy
I don't really know.	tsy fantatro marina
But it can be big on that.	mety ho lehibe aminizany anefa
It seems to be the best done.	toa ny tsara indrindra no natao
But this is true.	marina anefa izany
Definitely a first.	azo antoka fa voalohany
However, there are many problems with this approach.	na izany aza dia misy olana maro aminity fomba ity
And many other little things.	ary zavatra kely maro hafa
Here is a question.	ity misy fanontaniana
The road goes in two directions.	ny lalana dia mandeha aminny lalana roa
No one sees me.	tsy misy mahita ahy
This is a very common problem.	tena olana mahazatra izany
If they are ugly, make them very ugly.	raha ratsy tarehy izy ireo dia ataovy ratsy be izy ireo
I don’t really see him very well.	tsy dia hitako loatra izy raha ny marina
We are both real.	samy tena misy isika
Or maybe we don’t.	na mety tsy isika
But he was not wrong.	fa tsy diso izy
Maybe no one told him.	angamba tsy nisy nilaza taminy
I am new to all of this.	vaovao aminizany rehetra izany aho
They had an idea.	nanana hevitra izy ireo
But he knew enough.	saingy ampy ny fantany
In general, life is good.	aminny ankapobeny dia tsara ny fiainana
But this is not the worst.	tsy izany anefa no ratsy indrindra
Yes, as good as the first.	eny tsara toy ny voalohany
He loves things that work.	tiany ny zavatra miasa
If only people were that simple.	raha mba ho tsotra toy izany ny olona
This is not very new.	tsy dia vaovao loatra izany
It was never designed specifically.	tsy natao manokana mihitsy izany
They have a good idea.	manana hevitra tsara izy ireo
It was too late to start.	efa ela loatra izy no nanomboka
Maybe there was nothing there at all.	angamba tsy nisy na inona na inona mihitsy teo
Like, a long time.	toy ny ela be
No more need to do.	tsy mila atao intsony
Worth the trip.	mendrika ny dia
Only two.	roa ihany
But there is.	misy anefa izany
Some people come alone.	misy olona tonga irery
Safe and secure home.	trano azo antoka sy azo antoka
This is shown below.	izany no hita eo ambany
He will be there again.	ho tonga eo indray izy
It was farther inside.	lavitra kokoa ny tao anatiny
And now, he said, that day has surely come.	ary ankehitriny hoy izy dia tonga tokoa izany andro izany
He was almost dead.	efa saika maty izy
Otherwise, a lot of people would have had it.	raha tsy izany dia ho betsaka ny olona nanana izany
Those who want to do, are.	ireo izay te hanao dia
We will do it if we have to.	hanao izany izahay raha tsy maintsy
These people have a history.	manana tantara ireo olona ireo
He has been saying that for a long time.	efa ela izy vao nilaza izany
Such an idea is not worth it.	tsy mendrika ny hevitra toy izany
Especially in such a beautiful place.	indrindra fa aminny toerana tsara tarehy toy izany
He knows we are close.	fantany fa akaiky isika
He will do it.	izy no hanao izany
It starts at the beginning.	izy io dia manomboka aminny voalohany
But it may be different.	mety ho hafa anefa izany
It has always been a matter of money.	efa resaka vola foana io
I know you will get it.	fantatro fa ho azonao izany
Work for them, work for us.	miasa ho azy ireo miasa ho antsika
I no longer thought clearly.	tsy nieritreritra tsara intsony aho
The picture is easy.	mora ilay sary
Yes we are.	eny isika
I didn’t stop there.	tsy nijanona teo aho
Which is a good thing, too.	izay zavatra tsara ihany koa
We must be able to hope.	tsy maintsy afaka manantena isika
I didn’t say that.	tsy nilaza izany aho
You are the one.	ianao no iray
We did something stupid.	nanao zavatra adala izahay
I'm leaving.	lasa aho
You should know that they existed.	tokony ho fantatrao fa nisy izy ireo
Or be different.	na ho samy hafa karazana
Yes, we will not.	eny tsy hanao izany izahay
All of these are not for him.	tsy mety ho azy daholo ireo
So we have the right world and the right people.	noho izany dia manana tontolo mety sy olona mety ho azo atao isika
Or from him.	na avy aminy
It had to be.	tsy maintsy nisy izany
It doesn’t matter to men.	tsy zavadehibe ho anny lehilahy izany
He will always be there.	ho any foana izy
Well, that's not true.	eny ary tsy marina izany
She is too beautiful.	tsara tarehy loatra izy
In every game, and at all times.	aminny lalao rehetra ary aminny fotoana rehetra
You can come if you want.	afaka tonga ianao raha tianao
He is not stupid.	tsy adala izy
Either more accurate or more accurate or more worthy.	na marina kokoa na marina kokoa na mendrika kokoa
It is a whole new world.	tontolo vaovao tanteraka izany
Or have a little of both !.	na manana kely aminizy roa
He will never do such a bad thing.	tsy hanao ratsy toy izany mihitsy izy
He does what he wants to do.	manao izay tiany atao izy
To him, they could not do wrong.	ho azy dia tsy afaka nanao ratsy izy ireo
Yes, that is not the real reason.	eny tsy izany no tena antony
It loves you.	tia anao izany
Many of these words are still unintelligible.	maro aminireo teny ireo no mbola tsy azo
We both have it.	samy manana izany isika
It must be done well.	tsy maintsy atao tsara izany
She didn’t want to be pretty for him.	tsy te ho tsara tarehy ho azy izy
Do them well and do them hard.	ataovy tsara izy ireo ary ataovy mafy
The woman looked at me.	nijery ahy ilay vehivavy
It became me.	lasa ahy ilay izy
But this is not good.	tsy tsara anefa izany
We didn’t talk a bit.	tsy nanao resaka kely izahay
He was not wrong in any way.	tsy diso na iray aza izy
And maybe he just needs a job.	ary angamba mila asa fotsiny izy
He didn’t want the day to come, especially.	tsy tiany ho avy ny andro indrindra
You have done the right thing.	efa nanao ny marina ianao
But it didn’t come.	saingy tsy tonga izany
Other times not.	aminny fotoana hafa tsy
He doesn't like her.	tsy tia azy izy
Something that may not really exist.	zavatra mety dia tsy tena misy
They are very useful for long journeys by car.	tena ilaina aminny dia lavitra aminny fiara izy ireo
We are starting a new year now.	manomboka taona vaovao isika izao
The less thoughtful ones.	ireo tsy dia be hevitra
Maybe not this year, but he will.	mety tsy ho aminity taona ity fa hanao izany izy
It can be too big, sometimes.	mety ho lehibe loatra indraindray
There is so much more to it.	mbola betsaka kokoa ao
At that time it was all over.	taminizany fotoana izany no zavadrehetra
There was something else about this work.	nisy zavatra hafa momba ity asa ity
Not once, or once, and he knew it.	tsy indray mandeha na indray mandeha ary fantany izany
I really love you.	tena tia anao aho
In fact, it is neither good nor bad.	raha ny marina tsy tsara na ratsy izany
They are happy.	faly izy ireo
We need new people now.	mila olona vaovao isika ankehitriny
It's below.	eo ambany io
Some are mine, some are not.	ny ahy ny sasany ny sasany tsy
And we have.	ary manana isika
But it is not so simple.	tsy dia tsotra loatra anefa izany
I will not do anything unworthy.	tsy hanao zavatra tsy mendrika loatra aho
We all did well.	nanao tsara isika rehetra
To me, this is a problem.	amiko dia olana izany
Not when he’s too close.	tsy rehefa akaiky loatra izy
Sometimes it just comes, sometimes it goes.	indraindray dia tonga fotsiny indraindray mandeha
The place seemed lonely without it.	toa irery ilay toerana raha tsy nisy azy
It is still uncertain.	mbola tsy azo antoka izany
I don’t like a lot of people.	tsy tiako ny olona maro
And the next night.	ary ny alina manaraka
He found his place.	nahita ny toerana misy azy izy
No one loves you yet.	mbola tsy misy tia anao
If he wants to be so crazy.	raha te ho adala be izy
They have their reasons, they have yours.	manana ny antony izy ireo manana ny anao
She was as beautiful as ever, maybe more so.	tsara tarehy toy ny teo aloha izy angamba mihoatra noho izany
Likewise, he had it.	toy izany koa nanana azy
I couldn't even look at him.	tsy afaka nijery azy akory aho
I went right away.	nandeha avy hatrany aho
But it’s not like work.	saingy tsy toy ny asa izany
It becomes difficult.	lasa sarotra izany
So you have a lot of unhappy people.	noho izany dia manana olona maro tsy faly ianao
I looked hard at this place.	nijery mafy anio toerana io aho
You can do this quickly and easily.	azonao atao haingana sy mora izany
You never get it now.	tsy azonao izao mihitsy
On the other hand, they don’t.	aminny iray hafa dia tsy manao izany izy ireo
It doesn’t make sense and you know it doesn’t make sense.	tsy misy dikany izany ary fantatrao fa tsy misy dikany izany
It's all gone.	efa lasa daholo
See photo for photos.	jereo ny sary ho anny sary
Only the worst.	ny ratsy indrindra ihany
But there is no way around it.	saingy tsy misy fomba manodidina izany
I see you're not sure.	hitako fa tsy azonao antoka
This car is good.	tsara ity fiara ity
People look more than they should.	mijery mihoatra noho ny tokony ho izy ny olona
I was just lost.	very fotsiny aho
We are meaningless.	tsy misy dikany isika
Yes, it’s hard to say no.	eny sarotra ny nilaza hoe tsia
Better than you.	tsara kokoa noho ianao
You already get what you want.	efa azonao izay tianao
And follow a simple method.	ary manaraka fomba tsotra
But do it fast.	fa ataovy haingana
Sounds like a really good idea.	toa hevitra tsara tokoa
Without it, they would not exist.	raha tsy nisy izany dia tsy nisy izy ireo
She absolutely loves him.	tia azy tanteraka izy
I don't mean anything to you.	tsy misy dikany aminao aho
You are right, of course.	marina ny anao mazava ho azy
You don’t have to be so bad.	tsy tokony ho ratsy be ianao
There were people like him.	nisy olona toa azy koa
Not yet a man.	tsy mbola lehilahy
I will not do that.	tsy hanao izany aho
I have to have this car.	tsy maintsy manana ity fiara ity aho
It's really bad.	tena ratsy ny azy
He is not a pleasant man.	tsy lehilahy mahafinaritra izy
Good for him.	tsara ho azy
Not small and not big.	tsy kely ary tsy lehibe
They are confused about time or place.	very hevitra momba ny fotoana na ny toerana izy ireo
Not again.	tsia indray
In fact, there was almost no such thing.	raha ny marina dia saika tsy nisy toy izany
This is a problem in two ways.	olana aminny fomba roa izany
Housing is very difficult for people.	tena sarotra ny trano aminny olona
On its own, a good game.	aminny azy manokana lalao tsara
Women, in fact.	vehivavy raha ny marina
Yes, they are very common.	eny tena mahazatra izy ireo
He looked at the man again.	nijery indray ilay lehilahy izy
thank you.	misaotra
No more.	tsy misy intsony
I can do it faster on my own.	afaka manao izany haingana kokoa aho irery
It’s very easy for you.	tena mora aminao izany
That is the right path.	izany no lalana marina
He has nothing, but looks at everything.	tsy manana na inona na inona izy fa mijery ny zavadrehetra
They are very different.	tena samy hafa izy ireo
It goes so much more than that.	lasa mihoatra lavitra noho izany
For him alone.	ho azy irery
It could be a close one.	mety ho akaiky iray izany
But the house was empty.	tsy nisy na inona na inona anefa ilay trano
Others are the same.	mitovy ny hafa
Maybe too happy.	faly loatra angamba
Faster and possibly worse.	haingana kokoa ary mety ho ratsy kokoa
I like it real.	tiako raha tena izy
But he has also done his part.	efa nanao ny azy koa anefa izy
He seems to know the former.	toa fantany ilay taloha
This is not about you.	tsy momba anao ity
He has to see the reality here.	tsy maintsy mahita ny zavamisy eto izy
Life will be simpler.	ho tsotra kokoa ny fiainana
The game went well.	nandeha tsara ny lalao
Which wouldn’t be very good.	izay tsy ho tena tsara
It's been a long time.	efa ela be izay
Both seem to have gone too far.	samy toa lasa lavitra
Because you know.	satria fantatrao
Yes, one way or another.	eny fomba iray na hafa izany
Maybe he liked it.	tiany angamba ilay izy
But I think there is a problem.	saingy heveriko fa misy olana
You know you will.	fantatrao fa hanao izany ianao
The same is true of many others.	toy izany koa ny maro hafa
They look at them.	mijery azy ireo izy ireo
Everything will be easier.	ho mora kokoa ny zavadrehetra
That’s a big reason.	antony lehibe izany
We need more than that.	mila mihoatra noho izany isika
Whether you do or not.	na manao na tsy manao ianao
This is a difficult problem, in general.	olana sarotra izany aminny ankapobeny
But now the house will be empty.	ho foana anefa ny trano ankehitriny
It's a person.	olona io
The problem is, he doesn’t like it.	ny olana dia tsy tiany izany
It will be a wonderful night.	ho alina mahafinaritra izany
I hope soon.	manantena aho fa tsy ho ela
But we are all the same.	fa isika rehetra dia mitovy aminy
It could be one day, it could be two.	mety ho iray andro mety ho roa
And these may be true.	ary mety ho marina ireo
There seemed to be nothing left.	toa tsy nisy na inona na inona intsony
She loves the pictures.	tiany ny sary
But yes, it’s still all about him.	saingy eny mbola momba azy daholo izany
I see it everywhere.	hitako eny rehetra eny
So nothing at all.	ka tsy misy mihitsy
They never looked at me.	tsy nijery ahy mihitsy izy ireo
Then you will.	dia hanao izany ianao
Some do it.	misy manao izany
Now, that could be bad.	ankehitriny mety ho ratsy izany
It’s all about him.	momba azy daholo izany
They seem confused.	toa very hevitra izy ireo
It went fast.	nandeha haingana izany
I don’t always know that.	tsy fantatro foana izany
There is nothing special about women.	tsy misy zavatra manokana momba ny vehivavy
He looks at me everywhere.	mijery ahy eny rehetra eny izy
He seemed almost happy.	toa saika faly izy
Yes, we hope that will happen.	eny manantena isika fa ho tanteraka izany
But it is not busy.	tsy be atao anefa
It’s kind of crazy.	karazana adala izany
But now he is not doing that.	tsy manao izany anefa izy izao
In fact, his was the first.	raha ny marina dia ny azy no voalohany indrindra
I really hope they do well.	tena manantena aho fa hanao tsara izy ireo
Like, very appropriate.	toy ny tena mety
You're having fun now.	mahafinaritra anao izao
You can only do one kind of good.	karazana tsara iray ihany no azonao atao
In fact, there is not enough time.	raha ny marina dia tsy ampy ny fotoana
No job is the same.	tsy misy asa mitovy
It will go even further when it arrives.	ho lasa lavitra kokoa rehefa tonga
I might lose my home then.	mety ho very trano aho ary
It’s about history.	momba ny tantara ilay izy
Yes, this is not entirely true.	eny tsy marina tanteraka izany
He never looked at anything.	tsy nijery na inona na inona mihitsy izy
And we did it for a reason.	ary nanao izany izahay noho ny antony iray
They also don’t know about you.	tsy fantany koa ny momba anao
Bad people will still be bad.	ny olona ratsy dia mbola ho ratsy ihany
There is the other news.	misy ilay vaovao hafa
This is the first and most obvious reason.	izany no antony voalohany sy mazava indrindra
Of course they could.	mazava ho azy fa mety ho izy ireo
But something else happened.	nisy zavatra hafa tonga anefa
And he can't.	ary tsy afaka izy
This is the real person.	io no tena olona
Very fast.	haingana tsara
But he didn't like to look at her.	tsy tiany anefa ny nijery azy
This movement does not.	ity hetsika ity dia tsy manao izany
I didn't see well.	tsy nahita tsara aho
You had fun.	nahafinaritra anao
Everyone can watch it there.	afaka mijery azy any ny rehetra
Maybe he didn’t like it.	angamba tsy tiany izany
I should be on one or the other.	tokony ho eo aminny iray na ny iray aho
It could be even worse.	mety ho ratsy kokoa aza
It’s all meant to be fun.	izany rehetra izany dia natao ho mahafinaritra
But they are nothing.	tsy misy na inona na inona anefa izy ireo
It starts for us.	manomboka ho antsika izany
None of these.	tsy misy dikany aminireo
They also love fun.	tia mahafinaritra koa izy ireo
I always see them, so they really work.	hitako foana izy ireo ka tena miasa
You are still according to the world.	mbola araka izao tontolo izao ianao
And they look at options.	ary mijery ny safidy izy ireo
It has to be done quickly, so you have to.	tsy maintsy atao haingana izany ka tsy maintsy ianao
Yes, but not completely.	eny fa tsy tanteraka
He was good to me.	tsara tamiko izy
Once upon a time for me.	indray mandeha ho ahy
But it is also not an option.	tsy safidy koa anefa izany
It's not just that.	tsy izany fotsiny no izy
They did not.	tsy nanao izany ny azy ireo
It’s been a long time for me, too.	efa ela ihany koa no ahy
But, no, he was right.	saingy tsia marina ny azy
Not a good fight.	tsy tsara ady
Yes, even the one.	eny na dia ilay iray aza
The food was plentiful.	tena be ny sakafo tao
No, even better than that.	tsia na dia tsara kokoa noho izany aza
Everyone is happy.	faly ny rehetra
He needs the conversation.	mila ny resaka izy
It only works once.	indray mandeha ihany no miasa
It must mean something to you.	tsy maintsy misy dikany aminao ihany izany
They are too fast.	haingana loatra izy ireo
I got another one.	nahazo iray hafa aho
It’s a nonsense story.	tantara tsy misy dikany izany
Not if they deserve it, that is.	tsy raha mendrika izany izy ireo izany hoe
And so it is with everything else.	ary toy izany koa aminny zavatra hafa rehetra
This is not the best day for me.	tsy io no andro tsara indrindra ho ahy
This could be a false product.	mety ho vokatra diso izany
Fun, actually.	mahafinaritra raha ny marina
We must do that.	tokony hanao izany isika
And saw you.	ary nahita anao
This one is a bit cheap.	ity iray ity dia somary mora
In fact, none of us really did that either.	raha ny marina tsy nisy tena nanao izany koa izahay
And we can’t be everywhere at the same time.	ary tsy afaka ny ho eny rehetra eny aminny fotoana iray isika
Not bad, though.	tsy ratsy fa
We see the good and the bad.	mahita ny tsara sy ny ratsy isika aminizany
It’s hard to find a good woman.	sarotra ny mahita vehivavy tsara
But it’s fast.	saingy haingana izany
That's a long way.	lavitra be izany
Went around.	nandeha teny aminny manodidina
And all these people are doing things.	ary ireo olona rehetra ireo dia manao zavatra
It’s harder than it might seem.	sarotra kokoa noho izay mety ho hita
No one had it.	tsy nisy nanana izany
I kind of like it.	somary tiako izany
Beautiful place.	toerana tsara tarehy
But nothing came to me.	tsy nisy na inona na inona tonga tamiko anefa
I just don’t like it.	tsy tiako fotsiny izany
Over time, they will become more common.	rehefa mandeha ny fotoana dia ho hita aminny ankapobeny izy ireo
But there are others.	misy hafa koa anefa
Next time, take a look first.	aminny manaraka jereo kely aloha
The pictures too.	ny sary koa
It shouldn’t be there right now.	tsy tokony ho ao izany aminizao fotoana izao
It will still be there.	mbola ho hita eo
Too big.	lehibe loatra
And that is exactly what was there.	ary izany indrindra no tao
There is no choice whatsoever.	tsy misy safidy na inona na inona
Everything else is more complicated.	ny hafa rehetra dia sarotra kokoa
Only two people disagree.	olona roa ihany no tsy mitovy hevitra
It's still far away, but it's a little closer now.	mbola lavitra fa somary akaiky kokoa izao
As before, they didn’t go.	toy ny teo tsy nandeha izy ireo
But I have a question.	manana fanontaniana anefa aho
For them, we are very simple.	ho azy ireo dia tena tsotra isika
I didn't see it before.	tsy hitako aloha izany
The method consists of two parts.	ny fomba dia misy ampahany roa
He was right, and he knew it.	marina ny azy ary fantany izany
He was almost confused.	saika very hevitra izy
And here’s the idea.	ary izao ny hevitra
It's too far away.	lavitra loatra izany
But we didn't go there.	tsy nandeha tany anefa izahay
And this one.	ary ity iray ity
Beautiful, he thought not there.	tsara tarehy hoy izy nieritreritra tsy teo
It may have made sense in the past.	mety ho nisy dikany izany taloha
But many questions remained.	mbola maro anefa ny fanontaniana nijanona
It was as if he knew.	toy ny hoe fantany
It started well.	nanomboka tsara izany
They are fast.	haingana izy ireo
Like where he was.	toy ny toerana nisy azy
Yes, he loves her.	eny tiany izy
It doesn’t do anything at all.	tsy manao na inona na inona mihitsy
Not all women need me.	tsy mila ahy ny vehivavy rehetra
It’s fun to watch.	mahafinaritra ny mijery azy
And no, it's not.	ary tsia tsy izany
I think that's too true.	heveriko fa marina loatra izany
And between me and you, the faster the better.	ary eo amiko sy ianao ny haingana no tsara kokoa
Which is impossible.	izay tsy azo atao
What matters is the path.	ny zavadehibe dia ny lalana
It was inside.	tao anatiny izany
They all watched it.	nijery anio izy rehetra
A person who is supreme in himself.	olona iray izay ambony indrindra ny tenany
They are for us and for us alone.	ho antsika sy ho antsika irery izy ireo
He has to see it.	tsy maintsy mahita azy izy
Sounds good to me.	toa mety tsara amiko
Nice time.	ny fotoana mahafinaritra
But he had a good idea about the game.	nanana hevitra tsara momba ny lalao anefa izy
Which may be good for some.	izay mety ho tsara ho anny sasany
It’s a lot of steps.	dingana maro izany
Maybe one or two, nothing important.	angamba iray na roa tsy misy zavadehibe
There are others.	mbola misy hafa
Then again, he doesn’t need it.	avy eo indray dia tsy mila izany izy
Thank you for that work.	misaotra anao taminizany asa izany
He was too confused.	very hevitra loatra izy
And it’s not hard.	ary tsy sarotra izany
Then the idea came to him.	dia tonga taminy ilay hevitra
Even if you don’t.	na dia tsy manao izany aza ianao
Not like.	tsy toy ny
And he was very happy.	ary tena faly izy
It was small, simple, and meaningless.	kely sy tsotra ary tsy nisy dikany ilay izy
I can't do anything about it anymore.	tsy afaka manao na inona na inona intsony aho momba izany
I hope yours is better.	manantena aho fa tsara kokoa ny anao
This will do it.	izany dia hanao izany
Or not so much.	na tsy dia mazava loatra
They do.	manao izany izy ireo
We had that idea.	nanana izany hevitra izany izahay
But it could be worse than usual.	saingy mety ho ratsy kokoa noho ny mahazatra
Like there is no end.	toy ny tsy misy farany
And for everyone.	ary ho anny olona rehetra
Not one or two, each.	tsy iray na roa tsirairay avy
This goes next.	io no lasa manaraka
The two questions are not the same.	tsy mitovy ny fanontaniana roa
And this is the result.	ary ity no vokatra
There are many options.	misy safidy maro
But it still works.	saingy mbola mandeha ihany izany
Everyone about me.	ny olona rehetra momba ahy
I prefer the beautiful pictures.	tiako kokoa ny sary tsara tarehy
Thanks for the idea.	misaotra aminny hevitra
You should be happy too.	tokony ho faly koa ianao
It can’t be money.	tsy mety ho vola izany
But she is not just beautiful.	tsy hoe tsara tarehy fotsiny anefa izy
Although difficult before, it seems impossible now.	na dia sarotra aza teo aloha dia toa tsy azo atao izany ankehitriny
Often the place is simply empty.	matetika ny toerana dia tsy misy tsotra izao
It’s great.	lehibe izy io
All games are available.	ny lalao rehetra misy
Already, hadn’t.	efa tsy nanana
But it never goes well.	saingy tsy mandeha tsara mihitsy izany
It hasn't arrived yet.	tsy mbola tonga
They seem to enjoy doing it.	toa mahafinaritra azy ireo ny manao izany
You’re a man, and you’re not wrong.	lehilahy ianao ary tsy diso
No, it wasn't before.	tsia tsy izany taloha izany
No, he didn't come.	tsia tsy tonga izy
And of course it’s a more complicated story.	ary mazava ho azy fa tantara sarotra kokoa izany
This is the day now.	izao no andro ankehitriny
For all of them.	ho azy rehetra
In general, it won’t matter.	aminny ankapobeny dia tsy ho zavadehibe izany
But that is not true of me.	tsy marina anefa izany amiko
It started there.	nanomboka teo
The problem is real.	tena misy ilay olana
You are even smaller than people.	mbola kely kokoa ianao aminny olona
I think he likes her.	heveriko fa tiany izy
They are .	izy ireo dia
A lot of women had it.	betsaka ny vehivavy nanana izany
You need to hurry.	mila haingana ianao
But he knew he would do it, sometimes.	saingy fantany fa hanao izany izy indraindray
No, they don’t, but sometimes.	tsia tsy manao izany izy ireo fa indraindray
Thanks for the pictures.	misaotra taminny sary
Others will be there if you don’t die.	ny hafa izay ho eo raha tsy maty ianao
They are not far away.	tsy lavitra izy ireo
But he had no other choice.	saingy tsy nanana safidy hafa izy
You had to do it.	tsy maintsy nanao izany ianao
He told her he didn't.	nilaza taminy izy fa tsy nanao izany
I don't see any problem here.	tsy hitako izay olana eto
And it can always be for everyone.	ary mety ho anny rehetra foana izany
But it will come.	fa ho avy izany
But, of course, that is not the case.	saingy mazava ho azy tsy izany no izy
However, you can do this with.	na izany aza azonao atao izany aminny
I don't need one anymore.	tsy mila iray intsony aho
Although some of them are not enough.	na dia tsy ampy aza ny sasany aminizy ireo
No problem there.	tsy misy olana any
Reality is all around us.	ny zavamisy dia manodidina antsika
He didn't tell her.	tsy nilaza taminy izy
Not money.	tsy vola
Everything becomes normal.	lasa mahazatra ny zavadrehetra
Nothing to see here.	tsy misy hita eto
So we have a choice.	noho izany dia manana safidy isika
When none of these things are true.	rehefa tsy misy marina ireo zavatra ireo
It all comes down to food.	tonga hatrany aminny sakafo izany
But nothing can be done.	saingy tsy misy azo atao
We can hope.	afaka manantena isika
I wouldn’t have seen it coming.	tsy ho nahita izany ho avy aho
He had a great night.	nanana alina lehibe izy
Once he didn’t see me much anymore.	indray mandeha tsy dia nahita ahy intsony izy
We are even the same, people say.	mitovy mihitsy aza izahay hoy ny olona
But yes, for sure.	fa eny azo antoka
Impossible, but very difficult.	tsy azo atao fa tena sarotra
A lot like them.	be toa azy ireo
It’s not as big as the others, but it’s beautiful.	tsy dia lehibe toy ny hafa izy io fa tsara tarehy
Yes, it’s not too much.	eny tsy dia be loatra izany
Others are new.	ny hafa dia vaovao
They won't even know you're here.	tsy ho fantany akory fa eto ianao
And that’s what’s important.	ary izany no zavadehibe
You are as bad as everyone else.	ratsy toy ny hafa rehetra ianao
Yes, but it is true.	eny fa marina izany

What could have happened.	inona no mety ho nisy
You usually do it alone.	ianao irery no manao izany aminny ankapobeny

There weren't too many people there.	tsy dia betsaka loatra ny olona teo
Like everything else it starts with a story.	toy ny zavatra hafa rehetra dia manomboka aminny tantara
I don't need it.	tsy mila izany aho

Of course they are not.	mazava ho azy fa tsy izy ireo
This one is tough.	sarotra ity iray ity
If they had it, everything would be different.	raha nanana izany izy ireo dia ho hafa ny zavadrehetra
But he was almost found.	saika hita ihany anefa izy
It's been too long.	efa ela loatra ilay izy
Basically, everything is different.	aminny ankapobeny samy hafa ny zavadrehetra
However, there is something common that is not clear to me.	na izany aza misy zavatra mahazatra tsy mazava amiko
I'm safer than you are.	azo antoka kokoa noho ianao aho

They began to think.	nanomboka nieritreritra izy ireo
There is no real guarantee of this.	tsy misy antoka marina izany
He’s just something else.	zavatra hafa fotsiny izy
To him, time is of the essence.	aminy dia tsy misy dikany ny fotoana
People came.	tonga ny olona
And these actions are different for each person.	ary ireo hetsika ireo dia tsy mitovy aminny olona tsirairay
They are essential for that.	tena ilaina aminizany izy ireo
I know it doesn’t make much sense now.	fantatro fa tsy dia misy dikany loatra izany ankehitriny
I have an idea.	manana ny hevitra aho
That is all that is needed sometimes.	izay ihany no ilaina indraindray
Whatever you get, it will be worth it.	na inona na inona azonao dia ho mendrika izany

He said not you.	nilaza izy fa tsy ianao
There are many things about him.	betsaka ny zavatra momba azy

In fact, you deserve the best.	raha ny marina mendrika ny tsara indrindra ianao
I am not alone either.	tsy irery koa aho
He said the same thing about himself.	nilaza toy izany koa izy momba ny tenany
We are not with that.	tsy miaraka aminizany isika
We are on the right path.	eo aminny lalana marina isika
But none of this is really true.	saingy tsy misy aminireo no tena marina
He seems to have no idea.	toy ny tsy manana hevitra izy

Or he may not have one.	na mety tsy manana iray izy
It is very close.	tena akaiky izany
When he arrives, he will be in a better place.	rehefa tonga izy dia ho eo aminny toerana tsara kokoa

Or better yet, need to.	na tsara kokoa mila

It’s like I’m not getting a real job.	ho toy ny tsy mahazo asa tena izy aho
Now we have another problem.	manana olana iray indray isika izao

Not a really good thing.	tsy zavatra tsara tokoa

In other words, no.	aminny teny hafa tsia

Nothing seems to be the last time.	tsy misy toa ny fotoana farany
They didn't say anything to me.	tsy nilaza na inona na inona tamiko izy ireo
It’s already beautiful.	efa tsara tarehy
These are the.	ireo dia ny

I said do both !.	hoy aho hoe samy ataovy
I want everyone to do it for me.	tiako ny hanao izany amiko ny rehetra
Love and cherish them.	tia sy tia azy ireo
Not the right age.	tsy ny taona mety
No, not always.	tsia tsy izany foana
He will be selfish.	ho tia tena izy
He may have a picture.	mety manana sary izy
You have to do a good job with him.	tsy maintsy manao asa tsara miaraka aminy ianao
Not that we are.	tsy hoe isika
At the time it was probably the right path.	taminizany fotoana izany angamba no lalana marina
Such a lot of money.	vola be toy izany
I did it one night.	nanao izany aho indray alina
We should be happy when others love something.	tokony ho faly isika rehefa tia zavatra ny hafa

We did nothing wrong.	tsy nanao ratsy izahay
Often very fast.	matetika dia haingana be
They are gone too.	efa lasa koa izy ireo
Just a little bit.	kely fotsiny
To me, the story is almost complete.	amiko dia efa saika feno tanteraka ilay tantara
It always is.	foana izany
But that is not enough for me.	tsy ampy ahy anefa izany
Yes, that may not be the best idea.	eny mety tsy izany no hevitra tsara indrindra
For me it will be soon.	ho ahy tsy ho ela izany
I never wanted to come.	tsy te ho tonga mihitsy
He couldn't do anything about it.	tsy afaka nanao na inona na inona momba izany izy

Ideas are very important.	tena zavadehibe ny hevitra
The potential is huge.	ny mety dia lehibe
Certainly not in the past.	azo antoka fa tsy toy izany izy taloha
They had to travel far, as before.	tsy maintsy nandeha lavitra izy ireo toy ny teo aloha
That is, do what is right now.	izany hoe ataovy izay mety aminizao fotoana izao
Now, none of them are there.	ankehitriny tsy misy aminizy ireo ao

Others cannot.	ny hafa tsy afaka
I just love him.	tia azy fotsiny aho

Many will be there just like you.	maro no ho eo toa anao
It shouldn't be.	tsy tokony ho izany
Everyone sees it once and for all.	samy mahita izany indray mandeha ny rehetra
And it’s really not that hard.	ary tena tsy dia sarotra izany
There may be other ways.	mety misy fomba hafa
He is very, very good.	tena tsara tokoa izy
She might lose herself to this guy.	mety ho very ny tenany aminity lehilahy ity izy
I will not do that to you.	tsy hanao izany aminao aho
Not everyone did.	tsy ny rehetra no nanao izany
Both for their own.	samy ho aminny azy avy
It’s not the same at all.	tsy mitovy mihitsy
I think these people must be different.	heveriko fa tsy maintsy ho hafa ireo olona ireo
It used to be easier.	mora kokoa izany taloha
This game was in it.	ity lalao ity dia tao anatiny
Not unless you are very fast.	tsy raha tsy hoe haingana be ianao
Too much had to be done.	be loatra ny tsy maintsy natao
If so, that’s fine.	raha eny tsara izany

We are from the same place.	avy aminny toerana iray ihany izahay
This is very important to me.	tena lehibe ho ahy izany
Great and great choice.	safidy lehibe sy lehibe
They are no longer possible.	tsy azo atao intsony izy ireo
We are so happy to have you here.	tena faly izahay manana anao eto
It was a wonderful time.	fotoana mahafinaritra izany
Like, very simple.	toy ny tena tsotra
Things in themselves are nothing special.	ny zavatra aminny tenany dia tsy misy zavatra manokana
Otherwise, they won’t do the same.	raha tsy izany dia tsy hanao izany koa izy ireo
He follows her around or she follows him.	manaraka azy manodidina izy na izy manaraka azy
You probably already know that.	efa fantatrao angamba izany
One day it will all make sense.	indray andro any dia hisy dikany daholo izany
The first option is no choice.	ny safidy voalohany dia tsy misy safidy
This is for a specific reason.	izany dia noho ny antony manokana
The smaller man was too fast for him.	haingana loatra taminy ilay lehilahy kely kokoa
He had no surroundings.	tsy nanana manodidina izy
And we had a great time.	ary nanana fotoana tsara izahay
He is very important.	tena ilaina izy
And there it is.	ary misy izany
It’s easy and very versatile.	mora izany ary tena maro be
There was nothing lacking in it.	tsy nisy tsy ampy mihitsy ilay izy
Maybe we should do it a little more.	angamba tokony hanao izany kely kokoa
Yes, we will.	eny hanao izany isika
And this is the fun part.	ary ity no ampahany mahafinaritra
And that's it, you know.	ary izany no izy fantatrao
But it didn’t die, even close.	saingy tsy maty izany na dia akaiky aza
This is the first and biggest problem.	io no olana voalohany sy lehibe indrindra
Of course, history will come.	mazava ho azy fa ho avy ny tantara
Not on the ground nearby.	tsy teo aminny tany teo akaiky teo
The man is still dead.	mbola maty ihany ilay lehilahy
Sometimes it goes well, and sometimes it doesn’t.	indraindray mandeha tsara izany ary indraindray tsy mandeha
You still need good results.	mbola mila vokatra tsara ianao
But they may not be.	saingy mety tsy izy ireo
It doesn't seem to fit him anymore.	toa tsy mety aminy intsony
No other work.	tsy misy asa hafa
You got a good idea.	nahazo hevitra tsara ianao
And it doesn’t work.	ary tsy mandeha izany
I lost mine too.	very ny ahy koa
The following year he was at war again.	taminny taona manaraka dia teo aminny ady indray izy
It is only possible for now.	aminizao fotoana izao ihany no azo atao
I just had to be there.	tsy maintsy teo fotsiny aho
I think he knows that.	heveriko fa fantany izany
There was nothing like them.	tsy nisy toa azy ireo
I think it came naturally.	heveriko fa tonga ho azy izany
Yes, that sounds bad.	eny toa ratsy izany
I think so.	heveriko tsara izany
Some of them are dead now.	misy aminizy ireo no maty ankehitriny
I had to watch.	tsy maintsy nijery aho
Far, far worse.	lavitra ratsy lavitra
While this is true, it is actually a small problem.	na dia marina aza izany dia olana kely izany raha ny marina
But he needed to be sure.	nila nahazo antoka anefa izy
So this is the war.	ka izao no ady
Another good man.	lehilahy tsara iray hafa
No, it's still the same.	tsia mbola mitovy
There is still one way.	mbola misy fomba iray ihany
The result is as follows.	ny vokatra dia toy izao
Nothing stupid, nothing unusual.	tsy misy adala tsy misy tsy mahazatra
Too much of a day.	be loatra ny andro iray
They arrived early.	tonga aloha izy ireo
He liked it right away.	tiany avy hatrany izany
To me, it’s a little different.	amiko dia hafa kely izany
Yes, it is.	eny izy io
The portions are also large.	ny ampahany dia lehibe ihany koa
Yes, often.	eny matetika
It’s a safer way.	fomba azo antoka kokoa izany
Of course, we are not difficult.	marina fa tsy sarotra izahay
I will do the same in the end.	hanao toy izany koa aho aminny farany
That's work.	asa izay
I also had a past.	nanana ny lasa koa aho
It may be the same thing, but it’s something.	mety ho zavatra iray ihany izany fa zavatra izany
He needs to go.	mila mandeha izy
We need a big part.	mila ampahany lehibe izahay
But that may go too far.	mety ho lasa lavitra loatra anefa izany
They need to do it for themselves.	mila manao izany ho anny tenany izy ireo
I love this place.	tiako ity toerana ity
It’s not bad, it’s not bad.	tsy ratsy izany fa tsy ratsy
But he had another idea.	nanana hevitra hafa anefa izy
I need them eventually.	mila azy ireo aho aminny farany
Of course, we all have to work.	mazava ho azy fa tsy maintsy miasa isika rehetra
They are never lost.	tsy very mihitsy izy ireo
He didn't need to look at it.	tsy nila nijery izany izy
There are other activities as well.	misy hetsika hafa koa
They are missing.	tsy hita izy ireo
We both don’t want to be here.	samy tsy te ho eto izahay
Easier to work with.	mora kokoa ny miasa
But it really didn’t exist.	fa tena tsy nisy mihitsy
But that is a good question.	fanontaniana tsara anefa izany
Yes, only one.	eny iray ihany
So that is the question.	ka izay no fanontaniana
It was gone too.	lasa koa ilay izy
Or they might do something different and new.	na mety hanao zavatra hafa sy vaovao izy ireo
He always comes early and alone.	tonga aloha sy irery foana izy
Maybe he didn’t even know it.	angamba tsy fantany mihitsy izany
We will take a step back.	hanao dingana iray isika
He knew it immediately.	tonga dia fantany izany
These activities may be small.	mety ho kely ireo hetsika ireo
Now, he doesn’t even look at her.	ankehitriny tsy mijery azy akory izy
And they went.	ary nandeha izy ireo
For others, it is not.	aminny hafa dia tsy izany
If nothing else.	raha tsy misy hafa
We both don't need you there.	samy tsy mila anao any izahay roa
And the dead.	ary ny maty
Now he had it all.	ankehitriny dia nanana ny zavadrehetra izy
I also think that’s a good thing.	heveriko koa fa zavatra tsara izany
Here, we have nothing like that.	eto tsy manana na inona na inona toy izany isika
There are a lot of problems.	be ny olana
If not now.	raha tsy izao
There is no place for you.	tsy misy toerana ho anao
He is not alone in this story.	tsy irery izy aminity tantara ity
I had to see him.	tsy maintsy nahita azy aho
It was fun for everyone.	nahafinaritra ny rehetra izany
They are the same as usual.	mitovy aminny mahazatra izy ireo
A story game can be just a story game.	ny lalao tantara dia mety ho lalao momba ny tantara fotsiny
This is for him.	ho azy ity
I hope this is not the last.	manantena aho fa tsy ity farany
And you've been there too long.	ary efa ela loatra ianao no tany
I’m really happy with those two, you don’t know.	tena faly aho aminireo roa ireo tsy fantatrao
Now, not everyone is bad.	ankehitriny tsy ny rehetra no ratsy
However, if it’s not real, it doesn’t seem to make sense.	na izany aza raha tsy tena izy dia toa tsy misy dikany izany
No, that's too much.	tsia be loatra izany
I saw then.	hitako avy eo
So, thank you.	noho izany misaotra anao
It’s a fun game.	lalao mahafinaritra io
This is one of the main reasons.	izany no iray aminireo antony lehibe indrindra
I hope that in the coming year.	manantena aho fa aminny taona ho avy
Still a war.	mbola ady ihany
It was worth the difficult trip.	mendrika izany ilay dia sarotra
He thought about it all.	nieritreritra izany rehetra izany izy
There is no secure job.	tsy misy asa azo antoka
You may not like it, but it’s a fact.	mety tsy tianao izany saingy zavamisy izany
I can do anything.	afaka manao na inona na inona aho
Still, he was confused.	mbola very hevitra ihany anefa izy
I don't see this place again.	tsy hitako indray ity toerana ity
I'm not good anymore.	tsy tsara intsony aho
I don't think that's good.	heveriko fa tsy tsara izany
Thus, the.	araka izany ny
Then do the exact same thing.	dia manao zavatra mitovy tanteraka
It works all the time for me.	miasa aminny fotoana rehetra amiko
He was often absent.	matetika izy no tsy teo
He told me you would come here.	nilaza tamiko izy fa ho avy eto ianao
And he should be here.	ary tokony ho eto izy
There was nothing in it.	tsy nisy na inona na inona tao anatiny
And maybe that’s true now.	ary angamba marina izany ankehitriny
We really had a lot of questions.	tena nanana fanontaniana be dia be izahay
He looks like a good man.	toa lehilahy tsara izy
Everything is fine.	tsara ny zavadrehetra
But it is a matter of choice.	fa resaka safidy io
And a big one.	ary lehibe iray
You just love them.	tia azy ireo fotsiny ianao
But as you like.	fa araka izay tianao
It's mine, fine.	ahy io tsara
Make the first step fun and easy.	ataovy mahafinaritra sy mora ny dingana voalohany
I hope it will be completely and utterly wrong.	manantena aho fa ho diso tanteraka sy tanteraka
Nothing really happened.	tsy nisy zavatra tena nisy
He seemed to like it there.	toa tiany ilay izy any
He did not know these men.	tsy fantany ireo lehilahy ireo
Big or small.	lehibe na kely
The truth is not so simple.	tsy dia tsotra ny marina
He looked at the time.	nijery ny fotoana izy
This place is not the safe place it used to be.	ity toerana ity dia tsy ilay toerana azo antoka teo aloha
This is the one.	ity no iray
It’s hard not to be.	sarotra ny tsy ho
I was glad to find a place for us here.	faly aho nahita toerana ho anay eto
I know everyone.	fantatro ny rehetra
It was great to do.	tena tsara ny nanao izany
But in fact, it wasn’t all there.	saingy raha ny marina tsy nisy izany rehetra izany
Take a good look at everything.	jereo tsara ny zavadrehetra
There seems to be a problem.	toa misy olana
It’s been years and years.	taona sy taona maro izany
Not everything, but a big part of it.	tsy ny zavadrehetra fa ampahany lehibe aminizany
It looked really good.	nahita tena tsara izy io
But that is not the problem.	tsy izany anefa no olana
But that didn't make sense.	tsy nisy dikany anefa izany
No idea in the slightest.	tsy misy hevitra na dia kely aza
I knew right away.	fantatro avy hatrany
And men lose it.	ary ny lehilahy dia very izany
No, you know that.	tsia fantatrao izany
They went beyond work.	nandeha mihoatra noho ny asa izy ireo
Only one thing was done.	zavatra iray ihany no natao
But they are not like that at all.	tsy mba toy izany mihitsy anefa izy ireo
They didn’t have either.	tsy nanana koa izy ireo
Thanks for the question, as always.	misaotra aminny fanontaniana toy ny mahazatra
Now or not.	izao na tsia
Many of them already have.	maro aminizy ireo no efa manana
We will be there.	ho any izahay
And yes, they work.	ary eny miasa izy ireo
But maybe that’s not the way.	fa angamba tsy izany no fomba
Like, no.	toy ny hoe tsia
That is a real question.	tena fanontaniana izany
We do this in two steps.	manao izany aminny dingana roa izahay
They make loud words.	manao ny teny mafy izy ireo
They almost died.	saika maty izy ireo
I was not happy to see him.	tsy nahafinaritra ahy ny nahita azy
They’re all fun, and well worth it.	mahafinaritra daholo izy ireo ary mendrika izany
In both.	aminizy roa
We really are.	tena izany tokoa isika
The place is, of course, a long way off.	ny toerana dia mazava ho azy fa lasa lavitra
In that case, you still need someone.	aminizany dia mbola mila olona ianao
The past and the future.	ny lasa sy ny ho avy
You come to love them.	lasa tia azy ireo ianao
I am here for one thing and one thing.	zavatra iray sy zavatra iray ihany no eto aho
That will be true.	ho marina izany
There had to be something about him.	tsy maintsy nisy zavatra momba azy
There really was no other way out.	tena tsy nisy fomba hafa azo taminizany
He was happy too.	faly koa izy taminizany
And as long as you can.	ary raha mbola azonao atao
And they may be right about that.	ary mety ho marina izy ireo momba izany
Start as soon as you can.	manomboka araka izay azonao atao
I know I’m doing the wrong thing.	fantatro fa manao ny tsy mety aho
It may seem easy, but it can be difficult.	mety ho toa mora izany saingy mety ho sarotra izany
He already knows the truth.	efa fantany ny marina
Apparently they have little.	hita fa manana kely izy ireo
I don't seem to see why.	toa tsy hitako izay antony
You know all about me.	fantatrao ny momba ahy rehetra
But it is still difficult.	mbola mafy anefa izany
He should.	izy no tokony
This is good and bad.	tsara sy ratsy izany
Surely he really liked it.	azo antoka fa tena tiany izany
And that’s all a good thing, too.	ary zavatra tsara daholo koa izany
But that is the problem.	fa izay no olana
Maybe he's still there.	angamba mbola any izy
They are real people.	tena olona izy ireo
It’s almost not worth it sometimes.	saika tsy mendrika izany indraindray
And for others, work alone may not be enough.	ary ho anny hafa ny asa irery dia mety tsy ho ampy
But thanks too.	fa misaotra ihany koa
And then others.	ary avy eo ny hafa
I don't have that problem.	tsy manana izany olana izany aho
The word is wrong.	diso ilay teny
I love doing that.	tiako ny manao izany
Every activity is very important.	tena zavadehibe ny hetsika rehetra
Do it for yourself.	ataovy ho anao manokana
And it could be.	ary mety ho izy
Not too much.	tsy dia be loatra
He can walk.	afaka mandeha izy
Alone still alone.	irery mbola irery
It’s really nothing bad.	tena tsy misy ratsy izany
But we can do better, right.	saingy afaka manao zavatra tsara kokoa isika marina
It’s not hard to find, look right.	tsy sarotra ny mahita azy jereo ny mety
And in that way it was a great day.	ary taminizany fomba izany dia nahafinaritra ny andro
Life is so good.	tena tsara ny fiainana
All of that stuff is good.	tsara daholo izany zavatra izany
It works for me.	miasa amiko izany
There are three of us.	telo izahay
Anyway, someone loves him.	na izany na tsy izany misy olona tia azy
There are too many problems.	be loatra ny olana
I went crazy.	lasa adala aho
And some of that at many other times.	ary ny sasany aminizany aminny fotoana maro hafa
It was as if he was different.	toy ny hoe hafa izy
But yes, that’s good.	fa eny tsara izany
There was also this problem.	nisy ihany koa ity olana ity
He certainly did not.	azo antoka fa tsy nanao izany izy
But my problem is a little different.	hafa kely anefa ny olana misy ahy
In.	ao aminny
He has seen it.	efa nahita izy
He took two steps.	nanao dingana roa izy
This life is no longer life.	tsy fiainana intsony ity fiainana ity
Then, like this.	avy eo toy izao
He is no longer working.	tsy miasa intsony izy
But no.	saingy tsy misy
In the end, he needed it.	taminny farany dia nila izany izy
We look him up and down.	mijery azy ambony sy ambany izahay
Not necessary, of course.	tsy ilaina mazava ho azy
I know you don’t really want to do that.	fantatro fa tsy tena te hanao izany ianao
It looks so good.	toa tsara be ilay izy
Yes, that's all.	eny izay ihany
Some because of work, some because of other things.	ny sasany noho ny asa ny sasany noho ny zavatra hafa
This is not a bad thing.	tsy zavatra ratsy izany
Either way, they are, you know.	na izany na tsy izany izy ireo fantatrao
You know the crazy ideas that come with one sometimes.	fantatrao ny hevitra adala izay tonga aminny iray indraindray
In other worlds, everything is going well.	aminny tontolo hafa mandeha tsara ny zavadrehetra
Sometimes you will, sometimes you won’t.	indraindray ianao dia hanao izany indraindray tsy hanao izany ianao
He loves women.	tia vehivavy izy
He no longer knew what was true.	tsy fantany intsony izay marina
But, as you know, that is not possible.	saingy araka ny fantatrao dia tsy azo atao izany
This does not seem easy.	toa tsy mora anefa izany
Never look at it.	aza mijery izany mihitsy
It is meant for everyone.	natao ho anny rehetra izany
He really has the potential.	tena manana ny mety izy
The pictures are not the same.	tsy toy izany koa ny sary
I hope there will be more people like you.	manantena aho fa ho maro kokoa ny olona toa anao
He knew he should be happy.	fantany fa tokony ho faly izy
Starting there again tonight.	manomboka eo indray anio alina
We went fast but it was hard.	nandeha haingana izahay saingy sarotra izany
Right now, things are complete.	aminizao fotoana izao zavatra feno
However, we went.	na izany aza nandeha izahay
That or work harder.	izany na miasa mafy kokoa
The house only.	ny trano ihany
He may already know we are here.	mety efa fantany fa eto isika
Where you are in life right now is very good.	ny toerana misy anao eo aminny fiainana aminizao fotoana izao dia tena tsara
They are more like people.	mitovy kokoa aminny olona izy ireo
Since then, however, life has become difficult again.	nanomboka teo anefa dia lasa sarotra indray ny fiainana
There has always been a battle between good and evil.	nisy foana ny ady teo aminny tsara sy ny ratsy
But sometimes he finds it difficult to walk.	sarotra aminy anefa ny mandeha indraindray
I have always been a woman.	vehivavy foana aho
Everything was very easy then.	mora tokoa ny zavadrehetra taminizany
Or next time.	na aminny manaraka
It was a bad war.	ady ratsy ilay izy
In fact, the first option in general may not be enough.	raha ny marina ny safidy voalohany aminny ankapobeny dia mety tsy ho ampy
It still works.	mbola miasa izany
But now there seems to be a question.	toa misy fanontaniana anefa izao
The same is true for women.	toy izany koa ho anny vehivavy
We did not come here.	tsy tonga eto izahay
This man is a real man.	tena lehilahy io lehilahy io
There are two main steps to this.	misy dingana roa lehibe izany
There are a lot of them here.	be dia be eto izy ireo
Life is really hard.	sarotra tokoa ny fiainana
It was a great day.	tena tsara izany andro izany
I could be one.	mety ho iray aho
So everything is going well.	noho izany dia mandeha araka ny tokony ho izy ny zavadrehetra
They are still the same today.	mbola toy izany foana izy ireo ankehitriny
There is nothing else to lose from it.	tsy misy zavatra hafa ho very aminizany
But we’re not sure about that.	saingy tsy manana antoka momba izany izahay
That was all there was.	izay ihany no tao
Everything will be good when good is needed.	ho tsara ny zavadrehetra rehefa ilaina ny tsara
However, this is the next best thing.	na izany aza io no zavatra tsara indrindra manaraka
He is very different from himself.	tena hafa noho ny tenany izy
Maybe not me.	mety tsy aho
You are doing something good.	manao zavatra tsara ianao
And time just goes by.	ary mandeha fotsiny ny fotoana
I do not have.	tsy manana aho
But with this move, it makes a lot of sense.	saingy miaraka aminity hetsika ity dia misy dikany be izany
They are real.	tena zavamisy izy ireo
Yes, there was something.	eny nisy zavatra
But the problem came.	saingy tonga ny olana
The face is the most important thing.	ny tarehy no tena zavadehibe
Take a good look at him.	jereo tsara izy
There is still a lot to come.	mbola betsaka ny ho avy
I thought about the house.	nieritreritra ny trano aho
And the picture is full.	ary feno ny sary
But otherwise it is very close to somewhere.	fa raha tsy izany dia tena akaiky toerana
He's too much.	be loatra izy
Some people far away.	olona sasany eny lavitra eny
Do nothing about it.	aza manao na inona na inona momba izany
Not the kind of thing at all.	tsy ny karazana zavatra mihitsy
He looked at her face.	nijery ny tarehy izy
However, there is a problem.	na izany aza misy olana iray
I will come alone.	ho avy irery aho
Good things take time.	mila fotoana ny zavatra tsara
Yes, you are really here.	eny tena eto ianao
It could be both.	mety ho izy roa
Then you start with that.	dia manomboka aminizany ianao
No more than necessary.	tsy mihoatra ny ilaina
A lot of good men lost their jobs.	be dia be ny lehilahy tsara very asa
There are no events at this time.	tsy misy hetsika aminizao fotoana izao
He was meant to be.	natao ho azy izy
Yes, not all the time.	eny tsy ny fotoana rehetra
I find it works.	hitako fa miasa
He was fun when he grew up.	nahafinaritra izy rehefa lehibe
I didn’t think anything else about it.	tsy nieritreritra zavatra hafa momba izany aho
Or so it seems.	na izany no toa azy
But others are alone.	irery anefa ny hafa
Another day will do the same.	ny andro iray hafa dia hanao toy izany koa
It was not like real life.	tsy toy ny tena fiainana ilay izy
It is always there.	misy foana izy io
That can be really bad.	mety ho tena ratsy izany
I need it.	mila izany aho
Next year you can.	ny taona manaraka dia azonao atao
Maybe they weren’t there at all.	angamba tsy teo mihitsy izy ireo
He loved it all about it.	tiany daholo ny momba izany
I don't like this place.	tsy tiako ity toerana ity
And more about money, of course.	ary bebe kokoa momba ny vola mazava ho azy
I had never seen this before.	mbola tsy nahita izany aho taloha
Yes, we agree.	eny mitovy hevitra isika
It sounds fun.	toa mahafinaritra ilay izy
Because here.	satria eto
Of course, this is bad.	mazava ho azy fa ratsy izany
These are very different.	tena samy hafa ireo
He really did it.	izy no tena nanao izany
It also takes time.	mila fotoana koa izany
If possible.	raha azo atao
People are very happy.	tena faly ny olona
There is a purpose to life.	misy antony ny fiainana
We are off to a good start.	efa manomboka tsara isika
The small house always remained.	nijanona foana ny trano kely
The bad news is almost everything else.	ny vaovao ratsy dia saika ny zavatra hafa rehetra
I love everything for her.	tiako ny zavadrehetra ho azy
It works really well, almost too well.	tena miasa tsara saika tsara loatra
It doesn’t get the bigger picture.	tsy mahazo ny sary lehibe kokoa izany
I could just do it.	afaka nanao izany fotsiny aho
This story seems familiar.	toa mahazatra io tantara io
It was a bit small.	somary kely ilay izy
Life is so wonderful.	tena mahafinaritra ny fiainana
The conversation went like this.	lasa toy izao ny resaka
And he really needs me.	ary tena mila ahy izy
This day is kind of special.	ity andro ity dia karazana manokana
Or, it could all be a misconception.	na mety ho diso hevitra daholo izany
I wish you were not enough.	tiako ianao fa tsy ampy izany
But that’s three.	saingy telo izany
Look at that man.	jereo io lehilahy io
It might be as simple as that.	tsotra toy izany angamba
He needed more space.	nila toerana bebe kokoa izy
That's all.	dia izay ihany
He saw no one he knew.	tsy nahita olona fantany izy
He didn’t like it very much.	tsy tiany loatra izany
However, it has two major problems.	na izany aza manana olana roa lehibe izy io
They are simple and fun to make.	tsotra sy mahafinaritra ny manao azy ireo
It’s not for them, and not even for me.	tsy ho azy ireo izany ary na dia ny ahy aza
There was a war.	nisy ny ady
They may not even know.	mety tsy fantany akory
I know everyone here is the same.	fantatro fa toy izany koa ny olona rehetra eto
However, I can't.	na izany aza tsy afaka aho
There were many reasons.	nisy antony maro be
If that is the case, it is only one.	raha izany no antony dia iray ihany
The thing is still far from me.	mbola lavitra ahy ilay zavatra
Because you are not dead.	satria tsy maty ianao
But he was not wrong.	tsy diso anefa izy
He seems to be a very nice and kind person.	toa olona tena tsara sy tsara izy
It made sense at the time.	nisy dikany izany taminizany fotoana izany
It’s not that there’s no reason for it.	tsy hoe tsy misy antony izany
But, we can do better.	saingy afaka manao tsara kokoa isika
There was a war to come.	nisy ady ho avy
The house was not far away.	tsy lavitra teo no nisy ilay trano
I don’t want to do that anymore.	tsy te hanao izany intsony aho
That could be a bad thing.	mety ho zavatra ratsy izany
Good job if you can.	asa tsara raha azonao atao
And he looked good, too.	ary nijery tsara ihany koa izy
There is good money in it.	misy vola tsara ao
Come here.	tonga eto
However, it could still be me.	na izany aza mety ho ahy ihany izany
No one did anything again.	tsy nisy nanao na inona na inona indray
It’s just a game.	lalao ihany io
They did not see.	tsy nahita izy ireo
Lots of food.	be dia be ny sakafo
He had two.	nanana roa izy
But it was good for me.	saingy tsara tamiko izany
There is something here.	misy zavatra eto
Yes, it will still be there.	eny mbola ho hita eo izany
I am happy and hope for the best.	faly aho ary manantena ny tsara indrindra
He made you out of nothing.	izy no nanao anao taminny tsy misy
I don’t do that last thing.	tsy manao izany zavatra farany izany aho
But something is wrong.	misy zavatra tsy mety anefa
That is, while he is still working there.	izany hoe raha mbola miasa any izy
The battle is very difficult, to say the least.	tena sarotra ny ady raha ny kely indrindra
Apparently very close.	hita fa tena akaiky
Lots of work.	betsaka ny asa
I had never received anything before.	tsy mbola nahazo na inona na inona aho taloha
The story is real.	tena misy ilay tantara
Yes, all the money.	eny ny vola rehetra
The best people at work almost never get it.	ny olona tsara indrindra aminny asa dia saika tsy mahazo izany
They all went well.	nandeha tsara izy rehetra
Or in the news.	na aminny vaovao
We all need to be with it.	mila miaraka aminizany isika rehetra
When it arrives it’s fine.	rehefa tonga dia tsara
He is not working.	tsy miasa izy
The first part goes, but it doesn’t work.	mandeha ny ampahany voalohany saingy tsy mandeha izany
It’s not necessary in the slightest.	tsy ilaina izany na dia kely aza
They were wrong again.	diso hevitra indray izy ireo
It may even come to that.	mety ho tonga aminizany mihitsy aza
This follows from and.	ity dia manaraka avy aminny ary
And last picture here.	ary sary farany eto
I am very much like him.	tena mitovy aminy aho
If nothing else, it’s better than before.	raha tsy misy zavatra hafa dia tsara kokoa noho ny teo aloha
It’s a full -time place.	toerana feno fotoana izy io
But in fact, nothing else works.	fa raha ny marina tsy misy zavatra hafa miasa
They are insecure.	tsy azo antoka izy ireo
No, he still couldn't think of it.	tsia mbola tsy afaka nieritreritra izany izy
Whatever you may have been, you have been there.	izay rehetra mety ho anao dia efa nisy ianao
But now he knows.	fantany anefa izany ankehitriny
Yes, it is better, much better.	eny tsara kokoa izany tsara lavitra
He is definitely dead now.	azo antoka fa efa maty izy izao
What is your favorite day ?.	inona ny andro tianao indrindra
We went there but no one was there.	nandeha tany izahay fa tsy nisy olona tao
He seems to love you.	toa tia anao izy
There is no such person here.	tsy misy olona toy izany eto
I just need to be together and not individually.	mila miaraka ihany aho fa tsy tsirairay
It’s just a little lost, a little misplaced.	somary very fotsiny ilay izy somary diso toerana
I need the best man.	mila lehilahy tsara indrindra aho
He stopped, in fact.	nijanona izy raha ny marina
Yes, it is possible.	eny azo atao ary izany
Yes, it is easy now.	eny mora izany ankehitriny
It’s definitely a beautiful thing.	azo antoka fa zavatra tsara tarehy izy
There will certainly be a fierce battle.	azo antoka fa hisy ady mafy
Then it all made sense.	dia nisy dikany daholo izany
It is real and non -existent.	tena misy izy io ary tsy misy
They were nowhere to be seen.	tsy nisy hita intsony izy ireo
And here is a problem.	ary eto dia misy olana
It’s also possible.	mety ihany koa izany
He no longer had it in him.	tsy nanana izany tao aminy intsony izy
I might have thought a little.	mety ho nieritreritra kely aho
But you made a choice.	saingy nanao safidy ianao
Now, that’s better.	ankehitriny tsara kokoa izany
He seems to be doing a lot.	toa manao be dia be izy
Right, you say.	marina hoy ianao
It will not be easy.	tsy ho mora izany
But it shouldn’t be.	saingy tsy tokony hisy izany
They are both good.	samy tsara izy ireo
He was never seen.	tsy hita mihitsy izy
Nice car.	ny fiara mahafinaritra
It’s not that they come very far.	tsy hoe tonga lavitra be izy ireo
Men needed me.	nila ahy ny lehilahy
Many options are difficult.	sarotra ny safidy maro
Don't even start.	aza manomboka akory
But it’s hard to imagine.	sarotra anefa ny nieritreritra
There will be another night, many years.	mbola hisy alina hafa taona maro
The end time has come.	tonga ny fotoana farany
Great car.	fiara lehibe
He was her first favorite.	izy no tena tiany voalohany
And still do.	ary mbola manao
Even on long journeys.	na dia aminny dia lavitra aza
He said he had to go.	nilaza izy fa tsy maintsy mandeha
This is a wonderful story.	tantara mahafinaritra ity
He had a style.	nanana fomba izy
Sometimes it seems as if he just doesn't exist.	toy ny hoe tsy misy mihitsy izy indraindray
And then, the thing is gone.	ary avy eo lasa ilay zavatra
I never thought about him.	tsy nieritreritra momba azy mihitsy aho
It makes perfect sense.	misy dikany tanteraka izany
It’s certainly not that difficult.	azo antoka fa tsy dia sarotra izany
However, you know, it could be.	na izany aza fantatrao mety ho izany
Otherwise, it doesn’t matter.	raha tsy izany dia tsy zavadehibe
Can't get here fast.	tsy afaka tonga eto haingana
I have a lot of things like that.	manana zavatra maro toy izany aho
This year, too, will be no different.	ity taona ity koa dia tsy hisy hafa
It might have made a whole lot of sense.	mety ho nisy dikany tanteraka izany
Everything seems so good.	toa tsara be ny zavadrehetra
To him, these do not even seem bad.	aminy dia tsy toa ratsy akory ireo
It may be very close now.	mety ho tena akaiky izao
Far more true than that.	marina lavitra noho izany
They are not there.	tsy ao izy ireo
Women do nothing, nothing.	tsy manao na inona na inona ny vehivavy tsy misy na inona na inona
I know one thing is for sure.	fantatro fa zavatra iray no azo antoka
He didn’t seem to know that.	toa tsy fantany izany
The end is near.	efa akaiky ny farany
One word, one word from you.	teny iray teny iray ihany avy aminao
We have no way.	tsy manana ny lalana izahay
It was a difficult time for him.	fotoana sarotra ho azy izany
I love it and you know you do too.	tiako izany ary fantatrao fa manao izany koa ianao
And the news is not personal or non -personal.	ary ny vaovao dia tsy ho anny tena manokana na tsy manokana
Maybe that way is better.	angamba tsara kokoa izany fomba izany
The results are almost always the same.	saika mitovy foana ny vokatra azo
Not with women.	tsy miaraka aminny vehivavy
Next and now.	manaraka izao sy izao
Or this one.	na ity
You are good here.	tsara ianao eto
One of my favorites.	iray aminireo tiako foana
That’s what really matters.	izany no tena zavadehibe
He has a question.	manana fanontaniana izy
It was a difficult task.	asa sarotra ilay izy
I was just thinking.	nieritreritra fotsiny aho
Easier, better than men.	mora kokoa tsara kokoa noho ny lehilahy
He is not an unhappy man.	tsy lehilahy tsy faly izy
It was a fun story.	tantara nahafinaritra izany
But no one stayed very long.	saingy tsy nisy olona nijanona ela be
We have been there.	efa nisy izahay
Life took a normal course.	nanao lalana mahazatra ny fiainana
I don’t want it to be like work.	tsy tiako ho toy ny asa izany
No one sees.	tsy misy mahita
Whatever you want it to be.	na inona na inona tianao ho izy io
You can have the last word.	afaka manana ny teny farany ianao
We don’t have all these problems anymore.	tsy manana ireo olana rehetra ireo intsony isika
This can often be the case.	matetika no mety ho toy izany
Without them, I would not exist.	raha tsy misy azy ireo dia tsy misy ahy
There was a time.	nisy fotoana
Which was not there.	izay tsy nisy
But this is not the easiest way.	tsy izany anefa no fomba tsotra indrindra
We have nothing to lose.	tsy misy ho very izahay
It is as if we are still a long way off.	toy ny hoe mbola lavitra be isika
They are not stupid people.	tsy olona adala izy ireo
I said he wouldn't do it.	nilaza aho fa tsy hanao izany izy
You are not enough.	tsy ampy ianao
Many people had this idea.	olona maro no nanana izany hevitra izany
But not otherwise.	fa tsy raha tsy izany
They start acting crazy.	manomboka manao adala izy ireo
Best year.	taona tsara indrindra
I have to be.	tsy maintsy ho aho
Two for sure.	roa azo antoka
No need to see me again.	tsy ilaina ny mahita ahy indray
And what not.	ary inona no tsy
Nothing was found.	tsy nisy na inona na inona hita
It may seem to work.	mety ho toa miasa izany
People who agree with you.	olona mitovy hevitra aminao
They are very far away.	lavitra be izy ireo
For cars.	ho anny fiara
i have it.	manana azy aho
Well, now and again, maybe.	eny izao ary indray angamba
The best option may be the best option for you.	mety ho safidy tsara indrindra no safidy tsara indrindra ho anao
That’s the least you can do.	izany no kely indrindra azonao atao
I'm not crazy.	tsy adala aho
And we need to do whatever is right for you.	ary mila manao izay rehetra mety aminao izahay
They look at things wrong.	mijery zavatra tsy mety izy ireo
And the end will come.	ary ho tanteraka ny farany
And he wants to do it.	ary tiany ny hanao izany
Don't go talking.	aza mandeha manao resaka
It’s work.	asa izy io
They could have done it.	afaka nanao izany izy ireo
I never saw the real world like that again.	tsy hitako intsony ny tena tontolo toy izany
I should have started there.	tokony ho nanomboka taminizany aho
I had a little time.	nanana fotoana kely aho
And he went and found them.	dia nandeha izy ka nahita azy ireo
He won't do it to her.	tsy hanao izany aminy izy
But sometimes nothing is good.	saingy indraindray tsy misy tsara
There is no easy way around this.	tsy misy fomba mora manodidina izany
Maybe he won’t.	angamba tsy hanao izany izy
Now, for the good part.	ankehitriny ho anny ampahany tsara
It's all the same.	mitovy daholo
He couldn't tell her it was crazy.	tsy afaka nilaza taminy izy fa adala izany
But he always did.	nanao izany foana anefa izy
But it’s harder than that.	saingy sarotra kokoa noho izany
In fact, it is more important.	raha ny marina dia zavadehibe kokoa izany
It may work just like in the past.	mety miasa toy ny taminny lasa izany
We are very close to something here.	tena akaiky zavatra eto isika
And now he has a choice.	ary manana safidy izy izao
It was fun to see them like that.	nahafinaritra ny nahita azy ireo toy izany
It sounds silly, but it’s true.	toa adala fa marina izany
He already had enough, everything.	efa nanana ny ampy izy ny zavatra rehetra
Maybe that’s not good.	angamba tsy tsara izany
They agree with you.	mitovy hevitra aminao koa izy ireo
The new year is coming.	ho avy ny taona vaovao
You really aren’t sure about that.	tena tsy azonao antoka izany
I am also a grandmother.	bebe koa aho
It couldn’t have had it all.	tsy afaka nanana azy rehetra izany
The problem here is that everyone is different.	ny olana eto dia samy hafa ny tsirairay
He said it was different.	nilaza izy fa tsy mitovy aminy izany
This is very different.	hafa mihitsy ity
And never had.	ary tsy mba nanana
People just want to be better people.	te ho olona tsara kokoa fotsiny ny olona
These things are not things, for one.	ireo zavatra ireo dia tsy zavatra ho anny iray
Maybe two or three years ago.	mety ho roa na telo taona lasa izay
It didn’t make sense to me again.	tsy nisy dikany tamiko indray izany
I may have a little problem.	mety manana olana kely aho
He does the same today.	manao toy izany koa izy ankehitriny
I could see what was to come.	afaka nahita izay ho avy
In fact, it’s more complicated.	raha ny marina dia sarotra kokoa izany
In fact, it’s better than good.	raha ny marina dia tsara kokoa noho ny tsara izany
Whatever it was, of course he was happy with it.	na inona na inona izany dia mazava ho azy fa faly taminizany izy
That won’t be difficult.	izay tsy ho sarotra
The latter is for sure.	ny farany dia azo antoka
It’s really fun here.	tena mahafinaritra ny eto
There was nothing wrong with that.	tsy nisy na inona na inona ratsy momba izany
Either way, it’s better to be alone with such an idea.	na izany na tsy izany dia tsara kokoa ny irery miaraka aminny hevitra toy izany
And that’s the job.	ary izany no asa
It is almost impossible not to at that time.	saika tsy azo atao ny tsy aminizany fotoana izany
Overall this is good.	aminny ankapobeny dia tsara izany
Nothing has ever gone away.	tsy mbola nisy lasa mihitsy
He would never come to her in time.	tsy ho tonga aminy mihitsy izy aminny fotoana
Any fool can do difficult things.	ny adala rehetra dia afaka manao zavatra sarotra
Someone was watching.	nisy olona nijery
Yes, it has to be done.	eny tsy maintsy atao izany
You want this process to come naturally.	tianao ho tonga ho azy ity dingana ity
It just doesn’t do anything.	tsy manao na inona na inona fotsiny
It’s something completely different.	zavatra hafa tanteraka izany
I’m glad they do.	faly aho fa manao izany izy ireo
But not without hard work.	saingy tsy raha tsy misy asa mafy
You have gone too far.	lasa lavitra loatra ianao
Of course, the man was a good choice.	mazava ho azy fa safidy tsara ilay lehilahy
Sure there will be.	azo antoka fa hisy
I am a completely different person.	olona hafa tanteraka aho
The is a great choice.	ny no safidy lehibe
There is no way around this fact.	tsy misy lalana manodidina anio zavamisy io
Other men love her too.	lehilahy hafa koa tia azy
I always need you.	mila anao hatrany aho
But they really needed one.	tena nila iray ihany anefa izy ireo
However, here we can look the other way.	na izany aza eto dia afaka mijery lalana hafa isika
But it was fun to have it.	fa nahafinaritra ny nanana azy
Not a good idea.	tsy hevitra tsara
Looked at him again.	nijery azy indray
I think there is something to it.	heveriko fa misy zavatra aminizany
But nothing more can be done.	saingy tsy misy azo atao intsony
If no one did.	raha tsy nisy nanao izany
Not always enough.	tsy ampy foana
It came almost immediately.	tonga saika avy hatrany
It was so much fun but it was absolutely fun.	tena nahafinaritra fa nahafinaritra azy tanteraka
But we have almost nothing.	saika tsy manana na inona na inona anefa izahay
Because he knew that he would always be there for her.	satria fantany fa ho eo foana izy ho azy
They can't do that.	tsy afaka manao izany izy ireo
But, none of them can.	saingy tsy misy aminizy ireo afaka
But it doesn’t come from the neighborhood.	tsy avy aminny manodidina anefa izany
It’s all on the ground.	izany rehetra izany dia aminny tany
So you must be like that now.	noho izany dia tsy maintsy ho tonga toy izany ianao izao
Here is the question.	ity ary ny fanontaniana
I looked again.	nijery indray aho
Something seems wrong, even if it isn’t right.	misy zavatra toa tsy mety na tsy mety aza
It really doesn’t make sense.	tena tsy misy dikany ilay izy
There is something else for you.	mbola misy zavatra hafa ho anao
There is simply no reason.	tsy misy antony tsotra izao
This is not a problem for you.	tsy olana aminao izany
But we were just starting over.	vao nanomboka indray anefa izahay
But it made sense.	fa nisy dikany
He said he could see you.	nilaza izy fa afaka mahita anao
It’s all old history.	tantara taloha daholo izany
He could have watched it though.	afaka nijery izany izy na izany aza
Hope you are well.	manantena fa tsara ianao
I know everything here.	fantatro ny zavadrehetra eto
very true.	tena marina tokoa
I was all there.	tao daholo aho
This is not the first time either.	tsy vao voalohany koa izany
he said to himself.	hoy izy taminny tenany
He went the other way.	nandeha taminny lalana hafa izy
He knew he wouldn't do it.	fantany fa tsy hanao izany izy
I became close to him.	lasa akaiky azy aho
Went hard at times.	nandeha mafy indraindray
This time is different.	hafa indray ity fotoana ity
However, the work is not for everyone.	na izany aza ny asa dia tsy natao ho anny rehetra
So it is with men.	toy izany aminny lehilahy
And all this is nonsense.	ary izany rehetra izany dia tsy misy dikany
I know you have nothing for me.	fantatro fa tsy manana zavatra ho ahy ianao
Didn’t do much.	tsy nanao betsaka
We are yours.	anao izahay
This is not the time.	tsy fotoana izao
Soon.	tsy ela
The game is what matters.	ny lalao no zavadehibe
Now it all seemed pointless.	ankehitriny dia toa tsy nisy dikany izany rehetra izany
It was almost too easy, you say.	saika mora loatra ilay izy hoy ianao
And there was something else.	ary nisy zavatra hafa koa
But it’s fun.	mahafinaritra anefa izany
late night.	alina be
It's just a part of life.	ampahany aminny fiainana fotsiny izany
And you won’t lose anything with that.	ary tsy ho very na inona na inona ianao aminizany
You can't do that here.	tsy azonao atao izany eto
I don’t see that as a bad thing.	tsy hitako ho zavatra ratsy izany
And even higher.	ary mbola ambony kokoa
This is absolutely certain.	azo antoka tanteraka izany
Maybe that would be the best.	angamba mety ho tsara indrindra izany
In fact, it did.	raha ny marina dia nanao izany
So it’s really fun for him, too.	noho izany dia tena mahafinaritra azy koa izany
It’s not always easy either, but it’s important to me.	tsy mora foana koa izany fa zavadehibe amiko
And that can be a problem.	ary mety ho olana izany
She was happy, very happy, for him.	faly izy faly tokoa ho azy
It was a great year.	taona tena tsara izany
And then it was lost.	ary avy eo dia very izany
It came to me and left.	tonga tamiko ilay izy ary lasa nandeha
You know, when he said that, he really thought about it.	fantatrao fa rehefa nilaza izany izy dia tena nieritreritra izany
So both are together.	noho izany dia samy miaraka
It couldn’t be better than this.	tsy mety ho tsara kokoa noho ity izany
Nothing was obtained.	tsy nisy azo
He didn’t have it, that’s all.	tsy nanana izany izy izay ihany
They are no longer in it.	tsy ao anatiny intsony izy ireo
This is the main thing here.	io no tena zavadehibe eto
The place meant something special to him.	nisy dikany manokana taminy ilay toerana
As they went, they went.	rehefa nandeha izy ireo dia nandeha
There is this picture.	eo ary io sary io
I do the same, for him.	manao toy izany koa aho ho azy
They may be mistaken.	mety ho diso hevitra izy ireo
It’s like we need more problems.	toy ny hoe mila olana bebe kokoa izahay
Please look at each one.	mba jereo tsirairay
He also had other problems.	nanana olana hafa koa izy
I really like some of the ideas.	tena tiako ny hevitra sasany
You may.	azonao atao
He probably had a good reason.	nanana antony tsara angamba izy
I just want to be honest.	ny tiako ho marina fotsiny
There is a lot of evil and a lot of evil.	betsaka ny ratsy ary betsaka ny ratsy
Maybe more than that.	angamba mihoatra noho izany
It works better.	dia miasa tsara kokoa
And here we are now.	ary eto isika izao
Love him completely and utterly.	tia azy tanteraka sy tanteraka
That should be the easy part.	izany no tokony ho ny ampahany mora
But that's it.	fa izay ilay izy
You can see it now.	afaka mahita izany ianao izao
I'm really bad.	tena ratsy aho
They didn't even look at each other.	tsy nijery ny hafa akory izy ireo
Just looked at him and did it.	nijery azy fotsiny dia nanao izany
This is with the fact that everyone has the upper hand.	izany dia miaraka aminny zavamisy fa ny tsirairay dia manana ny ambony
do not follow him.	aza manaraka azy
He deserves more.	mendrika bebe kokoa izy
Each journey begins with the first step.	ny dia tsirairay dia manomboka aminny dingana voalohany
He looked closer.	nijery akaiky kokoa izy
But that is exactly what the story was about.	izany anefa no tena nisy ny tantara
He doesn't seem to be the happiest.	toa tsy faly indrindra izy
And there are other problems.	ary misy olana hafa
They are not enough.	tsy ampy izy ireo
I think you are absolutely right.	heveriko fa marina tanteraka ianao
In general.	aminny ankapobeny indrindra
Of course he had.	mazava ho azy fa nanana
They are real.	tena izy ireo
No, not like women.	tsia tsy toy ny vehivavy
He went there.	nandeha tany izy
And it is near.	ary efa akaiky
But it is only money.	vola ihany anefa izany
Of course we did.	mazava ho azy fa nanao izany izahay
We are not going very well.	tsy dia mandeha tsara isika
Or not much.	na tsy betsaka
Therefore, this idea is also irrelevant.	noho izany io hevitra io koa dia tsy misy dikany
But, no more.	saingy tsy misy intsony
That’s two things.	zavatra roa izany
Maybe something else.	angamba misy zavatra hafa
Simply no.	tsia tsotra izao
I have never done anything like that before.	mbola tsy nanao zavatra toy izany mihitsy aho
It must be something completely different.	tsy maintsy ho zavatra hafa tanteraka izany
Just like the real thing.	toy ny tena izy
Although not yet complete.	na dia mbola tsy feno aza
They’re a familiar place, and they work.	toerana mahazatra izy ireo ary miasa izy ireo
It all just works.	miasa fotsiny izany rehetra izany
He's dead, you know.	maty izy fantatrao
You needed more.	nila bebe kokoa ianao
Nothing could have been done without you.	tsy nisy azo natao izany raha tsy teo ianao
You really love him.	tena tia azy ianao
I know you will love me.	fantatro fa ho tia ahy ianao
I'm going fast.	mandeha haingana aho
He had never seen anything like it before.	mbola tsy nahita toy izany izy taloha
Of course, it can be done at any time of the year.	mazava ho azy fa azo atao aminny fotoana rehetra ny taona
The food was delicious and it was plentiful.	nahafinaritra ny sakafo ary be dia be izy io
That’s what’s more important.	izany no zavadehibe kokoa
Time is money.	ny fotoana dia vola
But he could have done something.	saingy mety ho nanao zavatra izy
They have never existed.	tsy mbola nisy izy ireo
I really need to do the same.	tena mila manao toy izany koa aho
You didn't say anything to me.	tsy nilaza na inona na inona tamiko ianao
Not too big and not too small.	tsy dia lehibe loatra ary tsy kely loatra
He went too far.	nandeha lavitra hatrany izy
They really do, and they do it well.	tena manao izany izy ireo ary manao izany tsara
Or rather.	na raha tokony ho izany
We could not be more wrong.	tsy mety ho diso kokoa isika
I don’t expect it to be.	tsy manantena aho fa ho izy
Those inside, stayed inside.	ireo tao anatiny nijanona tao anatiny
But it was really fun.	fa tena nahafinaritra
But that is not going to happen.	tsy ho tonga aminizany anefa izany
But not so with him.	tsy toy izany anefa ny momba azy
So we have to find a new path.	noho izany dia tsy maintsy mahita lalana vaovao
And maybe his too.	ary angamba ny azy koa
As always, they were all fun.	toy ny mahazatra mahafinaritra izy rehetra
It doesn’t really matter, he said.	tsy dia zavadehibe izany hoy izy
We can no longer have it.	tsy afaka manana izany intsony isika
He didn't even look at me.	tsy nijery ahy akory izy
i just love it.	tiako fotsiny izany
That’s the only thing that goes with it.	izany ihany no mandeha miaraka aminy
He probably liked the money.	nahafinaritra azy angamba ilay vola
But they are different.	hafa aminizy ireo anefa izany
He knew there would be an end.	fantany fa hisy ny farany
Not that he had much.	tsy hoe nanana be izy
I liked everyone.	nahafinaritra ahy ny olona rehetra
Money was everything to him.	ny vola no zavadrehetra taminy
Especially not tonight.	indrindra fa tsy aminizao alina be izao
This is always a problem.	olana foana izany
But we have to have it.	saingy tsy maintsy manana izany isika
Sounds better.	toa tsara kokoa
He came tonight.	tonga izy anio alina
I quickly looked around me.	nijery haingana ny manodidina ahy aho
It is very difficult to do it properly.	tena sarotra ny manao izany araka ny tokony ho izy
I love you close.	tiako ianao akaiky
This is her favorite story.	izany no tantara tiany indrindra
He is completely alone.	irery tanteraka izy
Then another one.	dia iray hafa indray avy eo
He should have done it harder.	tokony ho nanao izany mafy kokoa izy
It is important to do this soon.	tena ilaina ny manao izany tsy ho ela
I saw them first.	hitako aloha izy ireo
He knew it, the fool.	fantany izany ilay adala
This is a new place.	toerana vaovao ity
Well, some of that.	eny ary ny sasany aminizany
He was about three years old, like me.	tokony ho telo taona teo ho eo izy toa ahy
But that’s not much.	saingy tsy dia betsaka izany
This is the first one.	ity ny voalohany
Or something like that.	na zavatra toy izao
Then.	avy eo
There are no major problems in life.	tsy misy olana lehibe eo aminny fiainana
Apparently he was the only one who didn’t.	toa izy ihany no tsy nanana
Just as necessary.	toy ny tena ilaina
Of course, you were close to that.	mazava ho azy fa akaiky ianao taminizany
It’s a little more work for them.	asa kely kokoa ho azy ireo izany
It may not be as obvious.	tsy mety ho toy ny hita izany
Thanks again for the next step.	misaotra indray aminny dingana manaraka
But in the end it was really good.	saingy taminny farany dia tena tsara
So it’s a good fit.	noho izany dia mety tsara
It's not good anymore.	tsy tsara intsony ilay izy
You are here with me.	eto amiko ianao
It's a long way from there.	lavitra be avy any ka hatrany
He stayed there.	nijanona teo izy
They left quickly.	lasa haingana izy ireo
It’s fun and challenging.	mahafinaritra sy sarotra izany
But the reality here is good.	fa ny zavamisy eto dia tsara
But no one is there.	saingy tsy misy olona ao
These will be really good.	tena ho tsara ireo
I'll be a little early.	mbola ho eo aloha kely aho
The fact is the fact of the idea is not enough.	ny zavamisy dia ny zavamisy aminny hevitra tsy ampy
If it were for him.	raha toa ho azy izany
He may have already done so.	mety efa nanao izany izy
It’s a big, big story.	tantara lehibe sy lehibe izy io
This is a good and true idea.	hevitra tsara sy marina izany
And then not.	ary avy eo tsy
I have never done that.	tsy mbola nanao izany mihitsy
It could be three.	mety ho telo izany
Yes, there is one.	eny misy iray
He is confused, in everything.	very hevitra izy aminny zavatra rehetra
They are many, as usual.	betsaka izy ireo toy ny mahazatra
So did the woman.	toy izany koa ilay vehivavy
Yes, that is very clear.	eny mazava be izany
It was too late for both of them.	efa ela loatra izany ho azy roa
Full of history.	feno tantara
We are everything.	isika no zavadrehetra
They are fast, very fast.	haingana izy ireo haingana be
Someone who is better for you.	olona mety tsara kokoa aminao
He may be wrong.	mety diso teny izy
He is not in the right place.	tsy eo aminny toerana tsara izy
He doesn't know yet.	tsy mbola fantany
We really are.	isika tokoa
But not too much these days.	saingy tsy dia be loatra aminizao andro izao
I think that’s a fun thing to do.	heveriko fa zavatra mahafinaritra izany
But a beautiful place.	toerana tsara tarehy anefa
Not that this man seemed to have a problem.	tsy hoe toa nanana olana io lehilahy io
He couldn't think of her.	tsy afaka nieritreritra momba azy izy
And it is good and true.	ary tsara sy marina izany
Yes, good time.	eny fotoana tsara
Maybe soon.	tsy ho ela angamba
And it’s exactly the same.	ary mitovy tanteraka izany
We will all do the same.	samy hanao izany isika rehetra
Something was to come first.	nisy zavatra ho tonga aloha
In fact, it has become commonplace.	raha ny marina dia lasa mahazatra izany
I don't like it now.	tsy tiako izao
But it didn't really exist, and neither did the other one.	tsy tena nisy anefa ilay izy ary tsy nisy koa ilay iray
But they are not alone.	tsy izay ihany anefa izy ireo
That is still uncertain.	mbola tsy azo antoka izay
The next year may not be unusual.	mety tsy ho mahazatra ny taona manaraka
This is a problem.	olana iray izany
But he may just be wrong.	mety ho diso lalana fotsiny anefa izy
Which is not very familiar to us.	izay tsy dia mahazatra antsika
A lot can be done.	betsaka ny azo atao
We would be lost without them.	ho very isika raha tsy nisy azy ireo
You made sure.	nanao antoka ianao
You are just as bad.	ratsy toy izany koa ianao
I got it too, but maybe not too much.	nahazo izany koa aho fa angamba tsy dia be loatra
I know that's not true.	fantatro fa tsy marina izany
He did not think of these things.	tsy nieritreritra ireo zavatra ireo izy
We couldn’t get anything else.	tsy afaka nahazo zavatra hafa izahay
Wrong place and wrong time.	diso toerana sy fotoana diso
He liked the idea.	tiany ilay hevitra
I didn't see anyone.	tsy nahita olona aho
But for now, that is not enough.	saingy aminizao fotoana izao dia tsy ampy izany
I'm glad you came.	faly aho fa tonga ianao
We have more of everything because we deserve more.	manana bebe kokoa ny zavadrehetra isika satria mendrika kokoa
He did not know where he was.	tsy fantany izay nisy azy
And he is one of the good ones.	ary izy dia iray aminireo tsara
I hope you are well.	manantena aho fa tsara ianao
I also started, but smaller than some.	nanomboka ihany koa aho saingy kely kokoa noho ny sasany
It looks really good.	toa tena tsara ilay izy
I need a job like that.	mila asa toy izany aho
Everything seems pointless.	toa tsy misy dikany ny zavadrehetra
He looked at them all.	nijery azy rehetra izy
A little mistake.	diso kely iray
Not in many words.	tsy aminny teny maro
And life is not easy.	ary tsy mora ny fiainana
Sometimes it’s more than that.	indraindray dia mihoatra izany
I go and travel.	mandeha aho ary manao dia
Although he wasn’t too bad for me.	na dia tsy dia ratsy loatra tamiko aza izy
They must be different, but almost identical.	tsy maintsy ho samy hafa izy ireo saingy saika mitovy
But it is only one step.	saingy dingana iray ihany izany
But just like that.	fa toy izany ihany
He was there, in the right place.	teo izy teo aminny toerana tsara
From far, far away I am.	avy lavitra lavitra aho
Even if only a little.	na dia kely fotsiny aza
He does it all.	izy no manao izany rehetra izany
It’s not more than it should be.	tsy mihoatra ny tokony ho izy izany
You are the same in all life.	mitovy aminny fiainana rehetra ianao
So it was with me.	dia toy izany koa tamiko
A job should do the same thing.	ny asa iray dia tokony hanao zavatra iray ihany
But that is not true.	tsy izany anefa no marina
Yes, you can, because you did.	eny azonao atao satria nanao izany ianao
Only you.	ianao irery ihany
And he was the one who really came.	ary izy no tena tonga
But we will get to that eventually.	saingy ho tonga aminizany isika aminny farany
He may have known he wouldn’t.	mety ho fantany fa tsy ho izy
He was there now.	teo izy izao
The weather is good here.	tsara ny andro eto
You might even like it.	mety ho tianao mihitsy aza izany
It doesn't matter tonight.	tsy zavadehibe ny anio alina
Better, far better.	tsara kokoa tsara lavitra
He loved himself.	tiany ny tenany
But it was not.	tsy izy anefa ilay izy
You see something.	mahita zavatra ianao
The game is bad.	ratsy ny lalao
The best time of the day.	ny fotoana tsara indrindra aminny andro
Yes, not entirely new.	eny tsy vaovao tanteraka
I can't do anything for you.	tsy afaka manao na inona na inona ho anao aho
However, there are options.	na izany aza misy safidy
But then one of them makes a bad choice.	saingy avy eo dia manao safidy ratsy ny iray aminizy ireo
I have them, for sure, for sure.	manana azy ireo aho azo antoka azo antoka
He was nothing to her.	tsy inona na inona taminy izy
I knew he would.	fantatro fa hanao izany izy
I know you and your kind, man.	fantatro ianao sy ny karazana anao lehilahy
Right now it works fine.	aminizao fotoana izao dia miasa tsara izany
But she is very beautiful.	tena tsara tarehy anefa izy
And now they are gone.	ary izao dia lasa izy ireo
This can be done very easily.	azo atao mora tokoa izany
But he knew he had to do better than that.	fantany anefa fa tsy maintsy manao tsara kokoa noho izany izy
There are too many out there.	betsaka loatra ny any
And it’s easy to do.	ary mora ny manao izany
But in general.	fa aminny ankapobeny
It doesn’t seem very good to them.	toa tsy dia tsara loatra aminizy ireo izany
But he didn't look at them for anything.	saingy tsy nijery azy ireo na inona na inona izy
That’s what you don’t get when you stop working.	izany no tsy azonao rehefa tsy miasa intsony ianao
He had never seen anything like it.	mbola tsy nahita toy izany mihitsy izy
But it took too long.	fa ela loatra izany
It could never go away.	tsy afaka nandeha mihitsy izany
So that won't be a problem.	ka tsy hisy olana izany
And he may not be there.	ary mety tsy ho ao izy
But things are different now.	hafa mihitsy anefa ny any aminizao fotoana izao
It’s not the same.	tsy mitovy aminizany
There may be no one there.	mety tsy hisy olona any
He knew he couldn't stay there long.	fantany fa tsy afaka nijanona ela tao izy
Need money fast.	mila vola haingana
Without them, he had nothing else.	raha tsy nisy azy ireo dia tsy nanana zavatra hafa izy
It’s kind of fun, too.	karazana mahafinaritra koa izany
I saw that too.	nahita izany koa aho
I have to follow him.	tsy maintsy manaraka azy aho
Maybe that’s better.	angamba tsara kokoa izany
And now it all makes sense.	ary izao dia misy dikany daholo izany
But it seems entirely possible, albeit unusual.	saingy toa azo atao tanteraka izany na dia tsy mahazatra aza
You know there’s a lot to be personal about.	fantatrao fa be dia be ny tena manokana
The other thing is.	ny zavatra hafa dia
That’s the point.	izany no resaka
There could be nothing more important.	mety tsy hisy zavadehibe kokoa
If we don’t, we won’t do it.	raha tsy manao izany isika dia tsy hanao izany
No, it shouldn't be.	tsia tsy tokony ho izy
Everyone saw you.	nahita anao ny rehetra
A place with real people.	toerana misy olona tena izy
I am nothing.	tsy inona aho
But this is still a problem.	mbola misy olana ihany anefa izany
They had nothing, they had nothing.	tsy nanana na inona na inona izy ireo tsy nanana na inona na inona izy ireo
No, there was no such thing.	tsia tsy nisy toy izany
I was in it all.	teo aminny rehetra aho
But it was real.	tena nisy anefa izany
Action is also not possible.	tsy azo atao koa ny hetsika
We do not see.	tsy mahita izahay
I was just like that.	toy izany ihany aho
It was almost non -existent.	saika tsy nisy izany
Such a world is perfect for you.	tena mety aminao ny tontolo toy izany
There may be food.	mety misy sakafo
They finally did.	nanao izany izy ireo taminny farany
Everything is the same as the picture.	ny zavadrehetra dia mitovy aminny sary
It may happen one day.	mety hisy izany indray andro any
It seemed to make sense.	toa nisy dikany izany
Yes, that’s the story.	eny izany no tantara
I don’t think it’s going to happen.	tsy heveriko fa ho tanteraka izany
At first, that is.	taminny voalohany izany hoe
So they work on it.	ka miasa aminizany izy ireo
However, this is a bad idea.	na izany aza hevitra ratsy izany
I hope this is true.	manantena aho fa marina izany
You always have.	manana foana ianao
I got no word from him.	tsy nahazo teny taminy aho
You can’t do those two things at once.	tsy afaka manao ireo zavatra roa ireo indray mandeha ianao
He is the best of both worlds.	izy no tsara indrindra aminny tontolo roa
This man was real.	tena nisy tokoa ity lehilahy ity
It was a special time.	fotoana manokana izany
But if you don’t, it doesn’t matter.	fa raha tsy manao izany ianao dia tsy zavadehibe izany
He now owns it.	azy izy izao
This is new.	vaovao izany
But they will not.	tsy hanao izany anefa izy ireo
But we didn't go very far.	tsy lasa lavitra anefa izahay
And maybe it is.	ary angamba izany
Some from himself.	ny sasany avy aminny tenany
See him again.	nahita azy indray
The woman said no.	tsia hoy ilay vehivavy
It’s a pointless moment.	fotoana tsy misy dikany izany
It was late at night when we arrived.	efa alina be vao tonga izahay
They follow it.	manaraka izany izy ireo
Or just something else.	na hafa fotsiny
It seemed fun at first.	toa nahafinaritra taminny voalohany
Maybe he did too.	angamba nanao izany koa izy
It works in two stages.	miasa aminny dingana roa izy io
It goes too.	mandeha ihany koa
He is really you.	izy no tena anao
He has nothing to lose.	tsy misy na inona na inona ho very izy
Because of this.	noho io
It’s really not that bad.	tena tsy dia ratsy izany
But he does.	manao izany anefa izy
He didn't get it.	tsy nahazo izany izy
This game is more beautiful than ever.	ity lalao ity dia tsara tarehy kokoa noho ny teo aloha
No, that cannot be true.	tsia tsy mety ho marina izany
Such a fast -paced year.	haingana ny taona toy izany
Just got news.	vao nahazo vaovao
Apparently, no one did.	toa tsy nisy nanao izany anefa
Others are small.	ny hafa dia kely
Not only that.	tsy izany fotsiny
I should be there.	tokony ho any aho
They have a history.	manana tantara izy ireo
They may be lost.	mety ho very izy ireo
Everyone, so do the others.	ny tsirairay toy izany koa ny hafa
And we can become a person.	ary mety ho lasa olona iray isika
I don't know any.	tsy fantatro na iray aza
This thing is a war.	ady izany zavatra izany
He seems to be going well.	toa mandeha tsara izy
He still couldn't walk far.	mbola tsy afaka nandeha lavitra izy
Men are the reality.	ny lehilahy no tena zavamisy
But you don’t have to do that.	saingy tsy mila manao izany ianao
I hope this works for you.	manantena aho fa mety aminao izany
He needs money.	mila vola izy
And now it all has to go.	ary izao dia tsy maintsy mandeha daholo
But the worst is the people.	fa ny ratsy indrindra dia ny olona
Of course, this has not been the case before.	mazava ho azy fa tsy nisy izany taloha
It’s hard to go wrong.	sarotra ny mandeha diso
So he did not see.	ka tsy nahita izy
It’s like he has a problem.	toy ny hoe manana olana izy
I like the old stuff.	tiako ny zavatra taloha
They should be completely happy.	tokony ho faly tanteraka izy ireo
A good one.	tsara iray
These were the most fun.	ireo no nahafinaritra indrindra
And there is nothing better to do.	ary tsy misy tsara kokoa atao
I think that might make more sense.	heveriko fa mety hisy dikany kokoa izany
This place is not new to me.	tsy vaovao amiko io toerana io
Otherwise the process is simple.	raha tsy izany dia tsotra ny dingana
and there are also the two lost things.	ary eo koa ireo zavatra roa very
It is small and very beautiful.	kely ihany izy io ary tena tsara tarehy
The good news is moving fast.	mandeha haingana ny vaovao tsara
Sometimes they even work.	indraindray aza izy ireo miasa
I think this is the right thing to do.	heveriko fa ity no mety
And it can be.	ary mety izany
Even women.	na ny vehivavy aza
This is the missing thing.	izany no zavatra tsy hita
But it’s always the same.	saingy mitovy foana izany
Not in him, in him.	tsy ao aminy ao aminy
It was fun to do it again.	nahafinaritra ny nanao izany indray
Sometimes he goes too far.	indraindray dia lasa lavitra loatra izy
I know it’s not, it’s not real.	fantatro fa tsy izy tsy tena izy
It will be so.	ho toy izany mihitsy
And there is.	ary misy
He took another step.	nanao dingana hafa indray izy
Only the best.	ny tsara indrindra ihany
It certainly wasn’t meant to be for me.	azo antoka fa tsy natao ho ahy izany
There are other possible reasons.	misy antony hafa azo atao
That's not right you say.	tsy mety izany hoy ianao
But it didn’t make sense.	saingy tsy nisy dikany izany
Some do not.	ny sasany tsy
They are not too small.	tsy dia kely loatra izy ireo
I don’t think that’s a bad idea.	heveriko fa tsy hevitra ratsy izany
This one is beautiful.	tsara tarehy ity iray ity
Not sure if this is true or not.	tsy azo antoka na marina izany na tsia
No idea about many things.	tsy misy hevitra momba ny zavatra maro
The night was really fun.	tena nahafinaritra tokoa ny alina
You really have nothing to lose.	tena tsy misy ho very ianao
There he grew up.	teo izy no lehibe
This is the easiest.	izany no mora indrindra
He knew he was still thinking about it.	fantany fa mbola nieritreritra izany izy
It’s about war when war comes.	momba ny ady raha tonga ny ady
Therefore, it is not possible to obtain the following results.	noho izany tsy azo atao ny nahazo ny vokatra manaraka
Anything to be found was not there.	na inona na inona ho hita dia tsy tao
The world will be a better place.	ho toerana tsara kokoa izao tontolo izao
I just think he died of it all.	heveriko fotsiny fa maty aminizy rehetra izy
He still needs to take steps.	mbola mila manao dingana ihany izy
That's it, that's the end.	izany no izy izay no farany
It’s more than anything.	mihoatra noho ny rehetra izany
See also what’s available in bulk.	jereo koa hoe inona no misy betsaka
Nothing like it had ever happened to him.	tsy mbola nisy zavatra toy izany taminy
But now he had it too.	fa izao dia nanana azy koa izy
There must be a reason.	tsy maintsy misy antony ihany
Such a good idea.	hevitra tsara toy izany
It’s simple, like me.	tsotra ihany toa ahy
Maybe so.	angamba izany
But he is not.	tsy izy anefa
It still looks good.	mbola hita fa tsara
And he looked good.	ary nijery tsara izy
Of course, he was wrong.	mazava ho azy fa diso hevitra izy
Some of this is true.	marina ny sasany aminizany
These come from two issues.	ireo dia avy aminny olana roa
He paused to think for a moment.	nijanona izy nieritreritra kely
Or very close to him.	na tena akaiky azy
But there is no way there.	saingy tsy misy lalana any
Although not for long.	na dia tsy ho ela aza
We do it because we love the game.	manao izany izahay satria tia ny lalao
picture me.	sary aho
Good food and very nice.	sakafo tsara ary tena tsara tarehy
Some are from men.	avy aminny lehilahy ny sasany
But only today.	fa anio ihany
I certainly will.	azo antoka fa ho izany aho
There and gone fast.	teo ary lasa haingana
He also enjoyed the conversation.	nahafinaritra azy koa ilay resaka
I've been so crazy.	efa tena adala aho
That’s all you get.	izay ihany no azonao
I never saw it.	tsy hitako mihitsy izany
Probably for the same reason.	angamba noho ny antony mitovy
Time is the biggest factor.	ny fotoana no antony lehibe indrindra
It’s not his favorite thing but it’s a must.	tsy ny zavatra tiany indrindra fa tsy maintsy ilaina
One is underage.	tsy ampy taona ny iray
Every single thing.	ny zavatra tsirairay
The work itself is very different.	ny asa mihitsy no tena samy hafa
Then you’re gone.	dia lasa ianao avy eo
They were happy to see it.	nahafinaritra azy ireo ny nahita izany
The easiest difficult problem.	ny olana sarotra mora indrindra
It’s just good or bad.	tsara na ratsy fotsiny izany
But the universe is much more than that.	mihoatra noho izany anefa izao rehetra izao
But then he didn't need it.	tsy nila izany anefa izy avy eo
Many of it has gone well.	maro aminizy io no lasa tsara
Bad, bad, really bad.	ratsy ratsy tena ratsy
He recently died.	vao haingana no maty
But it might be harder than that again.	saingy mety ho sarotra kokoa noho izany indray izany
I love him.	tiako izy
Nothing is missing.	tsy misy tsy ampy
But then he looked at her too.	saingy avy eo dia nijery azy koa izy
It is not just a question.	tsy fanontaniana fotsiny ilay izy
They are empty now.	foana izy ireo ankehitriny
Conversation is important.	zavadehibe ny resaka
So we did, when it came to that.	dia nanao izany izahay raha tonga aminizany
Make it easy.	ataovy mora izany
Today’s species is different.	hafa ny karazana ankehitriny
Women maybe.	vehivavy angamba
It’s all about work.	momba ny asa daholo izany
Either way, it doesn’t make sense.	na izany na tsy izany dia tsy misy dikany izany
Now it seems to work.	aminizao fotoana izao dia toa miasa izany
All these men.	ireo lehilahy rehetra ireo
In the normal world.	ao aminny tontolo mahazatra
I don't like that car.	tsy tiako io fiara io
It should be an automatic process.	tokony ho dingana mandeha ho azy izany
and it seemed to exist.	ary toa nisy izany
Definitely better than one on the other.	azo antoka fa tsara kokoa noho ny iray aminny iray
Simple and low -key.	tsotra sy ambany ambany
They came hard.	tonga mafy izy ireo
I hope it will be beautiful.	manantena aho fa ho tsara tarehy
For the bad old days.	ho anny andro ratsy taloha
Their location is too close.	akaiky loatra ny toerana misy azy ireo
It went bad.	nandeha ratsy izany
But he knew it wasn't.	saingy fantany fa tsy izany
And for everyone, it’s different.	ary ho anny rehetra dia hafa izany
In general, it doesn’t make much sense.	aminny ankapobeny tsy dia misy dikany loatra izany
He is very different to me.	tena hafa mihitsy izy amiko
The fact is he did it.	ny zavamisy dia izy no nanao izany
And you certainly can’t go looking like that.	ary azo antoka fa tsy afaka mandeha mijery toy izany ianao
They don’t need it.	tsy mila izany izy ireo
He might go a little crazy.	mety ho lasa adala kely izy
And there are others.	ary mbola misy hafa koa
We didn't see anyone.	tsy nahita olona izahay
Apparently not at all.	hita fa tsy izany mihitsy
There is only one thing.	zavatra iray ihany no misy
Safe, easy and very fast.	azo antoka mora ary haingana dia haingana
Therefore, no necessary steps are required.	noho izany tsy ilaina ny dingana tsy maintsy atao
But he was a little wrong.	somary diso anefa izy
Of course he wouldn't.	mazava ho azy fa tsy hanao izany izy
There may be more now.	mety mbola hisy kokoa izao
Yes, he has done so many times before.	eny efa nanao izany matetika izy taloha
Now there is this, and this, and this and many more.	ankehitriny dia misy izao ary ity ary ity sy ny maro hafa
I think I really need one one day.	heveriko fa tena mila iray indray andro any
You certainly won’t.	azo antoka fa tsy hanao izany ianao
But history is important.	zavadehibe anefa ny tantara
It seems very small.	toa kely dia kely
It’s just different.	io ihany no hafa
This time is for you.	ity fotoana ity dia ho anao
And they are like us.	ary toa antsika izy ireo
Yes, you know that.	eny fantatrao izany
I will not do that now.	tsy hanao izany aho izao
I will lose my job.	ho very asa aho
Or yours too.	na ny anao koa
It’s all because of one man.	noho ny lehilahy iray izany rehetra izany
They may be there too.	mety ho eo koa izy ireo
I don’t even consider it a job.	tsy heveriko ho asa akory izany
He said it didn’t happen.	nilaza izy fa tsy nisy izany
The following is not necessary.	tsy ilaina ny manaraka
I must have a problem.	tsy maintsy manana olana aho
Immediately gone.	tonga dia lasa
It will also be fulfilled.	ho tanteraka koa izany
Great food.	ny sakafo lehibe
There was always something missing.	nisy zavatra tsy ampy foana
It became something completely different.	lasa zavatra hafa tanteraka izany
I really know him.	tena fantatro izy
He seems to be fast.	toa ho haingana izy
I could think again.	afaka nieritreritra indray aho
The clear day has come.	tonga ny andro mazava
It can be a lot of fun.	mety ho dia mahafinaritra izany
You now have a choice.	manana safidy ianao izao
It’s an easy and quick thing to do.	zavatra mora sy haingana atao izany
You know, the usual stuff.	fantatrao ny zavatra mahazatra
However, it is very free.	na izany aza tena afaka izany
No, that's not good.	tsia tsy tsara izany
I think that's wrong.	heveriko fa diso izany
No, no, you're not.	tsia tsia tsy izany ianao
It is a new world.	tontolo vaovao izany
So, more than anyone.	noho izany mihoatra noho ny anny rehetra
They all do it.	samy manao izany izy rehetra
But this is not true at all.	tsy marina mihitsy anefa izany
You have done me no wrong.	tsy nanao ratsy tamiko ianao
The food is delicious.	mahafinaritra ny sakafo
Or some things are just right for everyone.	na mety ho anny rehetra ihany ny zavatra sasany
I really have no idea.	tena tsy manana hevitra aho
But not everyone is like that.	saingy tsy ny rehetra no toa azy
Just a little bit.	kely ihany
I enjoyed it.	nahafinaritra ahy
If you are really good, you will get it !.	raha tena tsara ianao dia ho azonao
It’s easy, especially when traveling.	mora izany indrindra raha mandeha
There never was, there never would have been.	tsy nisy mihitsy tsy ho nisy mihitsy
What a pleasure we had.	inona no nahafinaritra anay
Too many have died.	be loatra ny efa maty
This is not meant to be true.	tsy natao ho marina izany
It was a good job.	asa tsara ilay izy
There always seems to be a good age for something.	toa misy taona tsara foana ho anny zavatra iray
He is not a good man.	tsy lehilahy tsara izy
There is no real.	tsy misy ny tena izy
I don’t think it should be.	heveriko fa tsy tokony izany
Whatever it is, it’s great.	na inona na inona izany dia lehibe izany
He just seems to do it.	toa manao izany ihany izy
We didn’t go for that.	tsy nandeha taminizany izahay
We are happy to do so.	faly izahay manao izany
Just start walking.	manomboka mandeha fotsiny
This is exactly where we are.	toy izany ihany ny toerana misy antsika
So and then some.	toy izany ary avy eo ny sasany
They do a lot of things.	manao zavatra maro izy ireo
Many people don’t want to be seen as ordinary.	maro ny olona tsy te ho hita ho mahazatra
All of these reasons are usually good.	ireo antony rehetra ireo dia matetika tsara
Or this one alone.	na ity irery
That should be true.	tokony ho marina izany
There is no more talk now.	tsy misy resaka intsony izao
But he deserves it.	mendrika izany anefa izy
To be there either.	ho any na
He loves us all.	tiany isika rehetra
He could not walk and walk as he pleased.	tsy afaka nandeha sy nandeha araka izay tiany izy
And there’s a great story in it.	ary misy tantara lehibe ao anatiny
He had seen something like that before.	efa nahita zavatra toy izany izy taloha
I found the first to be worse.	hitako fa ratsy kokoa ilay voalohany
But he had had enough.	efa ampy anefa izy
So, the words are not the same.	noho izany ny teny dia tsy mitovy
There has to be some kind of path there.	tsy maintsy misy karazana lalana any
If he did, he might even have an idea.	raha nanao izany izy dia mety manana hevitra mihitsy aza
This stuff is always in the news.	misy anio zavatra io aminny vaovao foana
Or maybe they don’t.	na angamba tsy manao izany izy ireo
Even today.	na dia aminizao andro izao aza
Both things are true.	marina ny momba ireo zavatra roa ireo
Some are happy to be there.	ny sasany faly mbola eo
But the night was the worst.	fa ny alina no ratsy indrindra
They are very fast.	tena haingana be izy ireo
These are so much fun.	mahafinaritra be ireo
Not the bad one.	tsy ilay ratsy
She’s been thinking about him a lot lately.	nieritreritra azy be izy vao haingana
Not the great, but the good.	tsy ny lehibe fa ny tsara
I really should have known.	tena tokony ho fantatro
He had just thought about it.	vao avy nieritreritra azy izy
I know you will know that.	fantatro fa ho fantatrao izany
Here is one way.	ity misy fomba iray
It is very important to be first.	tena zavadehibe ny ho voalohany
It never went well.	tsy nandeha tsara mihitsy izany
I think we need to do that now.	heveriko fa mila manao izany isika izao
Maybe they’ll know something.	angamba ho fantany zavatra
And with that.	ary aminizany
What matters is that the story is very important.	ny zavadehibe dia ny hoe tena zavadehibe ny tantara
Anyway, the house is a very good choice.	na izany na tsy izany ny trano dia safidy tena tsara
So these are the people.	ka ireo no olona
The days here can be tough.	mety ho sarotra ny andro eto
I watched him walk.	nijery azy nandeha aho
Maybe he does now.	angamba manao izany izy izao
He got bad news, that’s all.	nahazo vaovao ratsy izy izay ihany
It’s harder to be a decent person.	sarotra kokoa ny ho olona mendrika izany
Not bad but just different.	tsy ratsy fa hafa ihany
It’s not a small amount of money.	tsy vola kely izany
As before.	toy ny taloha
Someone else must have had it.	tsy maintsy misy olona hafa nanana izany
He even enjoyed it.	nahafinaritra azy mihitsy aza izany
But no, it had to go.	saingy tsia tsy maintsy nandeha izany
I really love you, you know.	tena tiako ianao fantatrao
If they went, they went.	raha nandeha izy ireo dia lasa
But the latter is the most important of all reasons.	ny farany anefa no zavadehibe indrindra aminny antony rehetra
We stayed ahead.	nijanona teo aloha izahay
It seems small, even to me.	toa kely na dia ho ahy aza
It took time, it took years.	nila fotoana taona maro izany
They don't even seem to know.	toa tsy fantany akory izy ireo
He said it was wrong.	nilaza izy fa diso izany
You've thought about it.	efa nieritreritra izany ianao
There has to be a faster way.	tsy maintsy misy fomba haingana kokoa
These are not good.	tsy tsara ireo
That might be enough for him.	mety ho ampy ho azy izany
But that is out of the question.	tsy misy resaka anefa izany
It went really well for us.	tena nandeha tsara ho antsika izany
Both are incomplete.	samy tsy feno
Of course you get it all.	mazava ho azy fa azonao izany rehetra izany
I don’t expect him.	tsy manantena azy aho
Everything is lost.	zavatra very daholo ny zavatra rehetra
It wasn’t well thought out.	tsy nieritreritra tsara izany
There has never been and never will be.	mbola tsy nisy ary tsy hisy mihitsy
We had this best part of the year.	nanana ity ampahany tsara indrindra taminny taona ity izahay
It turns out that this is possible.	hita fa azo atao izany
That seems to be a problem.	toa olana izany
And do it often.	ary ataovy matetika
It is low.	ambany izy io
If you don’t like it, it’s too bad.	raha tsy tianao dia ratsy loatra
People are confused about it.	very hevitra ny olona momba izany
I think it was the same.	heveriko fa iray ihany ilay izy
But there is more.	misy zavatra hafa koa anefa
One day, one day.	indray andro indray andro
If you have more than one, one is smaller.	raha manana mihoatra ny iray kely kokoa ny iray
But we were wrong.	diso anefa izahay
There is such a thing.	misy ny toy izany
I don’t want to do anything about it.	tsy te hanao na inona na inona aminizany
And have it.	ary manana izany
It was easy to find.	mora ny nahita azy
It’s all really bad.	tena ratsy daholo izany
Even if he made it that far.	raha nanao izany lavitra izany aza izy
You are a wonderful person.	olona mahafinaritra ianao
He soon realized he was wrong.	tsy ela dia fantany fa diso izy
I was able to walk easily.	afaka nandeha mora aho
I see it now.	hitako izany izao
He was a little confused.	somary very hevitra izy
We disagree.	tsy mitovy hevitra izahay
All new cars.	fiara vaovao rehetra
But you know it.	fantatrao anefa izany
We can see that.	afaka mijery izany isika
These are even smaller, maybe too small.	ireo dia mbola kely kokoa mety ho kely loatra
Do with them what you want.	ataovy aminizy ireo izay tianao
There is so much about him.	be dia be ny momba azy
The general idea is that it’s better.	ny hevitra ankapobeny dia tsara kokoa izany
There seems to be no end to the problem.	toa tsy misy farany ny olana
If he said so, so be it.	raha nilaza izy fa izany dia izany tokoa
However, we have a better option.	na izany aza dia manana safidy tsara kokoa izahay
These are the good things.	ireo no zavatra tsara
Very simple indeed.	tena tsotra tokoa
It’s always new.	vaovao foana izany
We have no problem with that.	tsy manana olana aminizany izahay
I didn’t have much fun anymore.	tsy dia nahafinaritra ahy intsony
It’s just a game, really.	lalao fotsiny ihany io raha ny marina
They stayed there.	nijanona tao izy ireo
It was definitely one of the hardest jobs.	azo antoka fa iray aminireo asa mafy indrindra izany
I still think that’s a bad idea.	mbola heveriko fa hevitra ratsy izany
I really hope everything goes well.	tena manantena aho fa mandeha ny zavadrehetra
Both will not be enough alone.	samy tsy ho ampy irery
It doesn’t seem like everything comes so easily.	tsy toy ny hoe tonga mora be ny zavadrehetra
he is ugly.	ratsy tarehy izy
He was very important to me.	tena zavadehibe tamiko izy
You can work here.	afaka miasa eto ianao
So we went to do it.	dia nandeha nanao izany izahay
These are not true.	tsy marina ireo
One must be wrong.	tsy maintsy diso ny iray
A man cannot do everything.	ny lehilahy iray dia tsy afaka manao ny zavadrehetra
War of time.	ady aminny fotoana
The house remained derelict.	ny trano dia nijanona ho tsy misy dikany
It was too early to get the full picture.	mbola aloha loatra vao nahazo sary feno
He could not do enough.	tsy afaka nanao ampy izy
And they are good.	ary tsara izy ireo
The house is lost.	very ny trano
It's mine now.	ahy izy izao
They are real things.	zavatra tena izy ireo
You don’t know that.	tsy fantatrao izany
Going too fast.	mandeha haingana loatra
And check out the news.	ary jereo ny vaovao
I am a working woman.	vehivavy miasa aho
Worst of all, though.	ny ratsy indrindra anefa
Although it made sense.	na dia nisy dikany aza izany
I know that time will come.	fantatro fa ho avy izany fotoana izany
Only mine.	ny ahy ihany
I won't be there in time.	tsy ho tonga any aho aminny fotoana
No more reality.	tsy misy zavamisy intsony
This is an idea, not a fact.	hevitra izany fa tsy zavamisy
But he is a man.	fa lehilahy izy
Very different.	tena hafa mihitsy
Thank you for seeing it.	misaotra anao nahita azy
It’s really fun to watch on your own.	tena mahafinaritra ny mijery azy manokana
But they went.	saingy nandeha izy ireo
I think you are really stupid.	heveriko fa tena adala ianao
Like, speed is impossible.	toy ny haingana tsy azo atao
But you know his.	fa fantatrao ny azy
Fun work as usual.	asa mahafinaritra toy ny mahazatra
He is worse.	ratsy kokoa izy
The question is not about us.	tsy momba antsika ny fanontaniana
So this is a common problem.	noho izany dia olana mahazatra izany
The problem is that this movement has no way.	ny olana dia tsy misy lalana ity hetsika ity
I hope they don’t.	manantena aho fa tsy hanao izany izy ireo
No one can do that.	tsy misy afaka manao izany
You have been there a long time.	efa ela ianao no tao
It will never come to him.	tsy ho tonga aminy mihitsy izany
That’s too much, he might say.	be loatra izany hoy angamba izy
The two are very different.	tena samy hafa izy roa
Not two years from now.	tsy roa taona manomboka izao
But that was a problem one day.	saingy olana indray andro izany
You will have to be found.	tsy maintsy ho hita ianao
This is a new low.	ity dia ambany vaovao
There was nothing wrong with that.	tsy nisy zavatra ratsy taminizany
Everything for everyone.	ny zavadrehetra ho anny rehetra
You have to work hard.	mila miasa mafy ianao
We found our way tonight.	nahita lalana izahay anio alina
In general, this is not possible.	aminny ankapobeny dia tsy azo atao izany
Do what is right for you.	ataovy izay mety aminao
It will be difficult for him.	ho sarotra aminy izany
Always worse than before.	ratsy noho ny teo aloha foana
It will all be gone if you will.	ho lasa daholo izany raha tianao
Evil and meaningless.	ratsy sy tsy misy dikany
Good for special occasions.	tsara ho anny fotoana manokana
It can make so much sense that it really doesn’t make sense.	mety misy dikany be izany ka tena tsy misy dikany
Right now, anything is fun.	aminizao fotoana izao na inona na inona mahafinaritra
And he had a house, first.	ary nanana trano izy ny voalohany
But he is still an adult.	mbola lehibe anefa izy
The first two years are the hardest.	ny roa taona voalohany no sarotra indrindra
We all went.	nandeha izahay rehetra
People love her and it’s fun to be together.	olona tia azy ary mahafinaritra ny miaraka
Yes, enough for him.	eny ampy ho azy
He’s just not dead yet.	mbola tsy maty fotsiny izy
Soon a new movement began.	tsy ela dia nisy hetsika vaovao nanomboka
Better yet.	tsara kokoa
He stopped completely.	nijanona tanteraka izy
This man is great.	lehibe io lehilahy io
Even us.	na dia izahay
Sometimes, though.	izany anefa indraindray
He will be completely different.	ho hafa mihitsy izy
We also have good options.	manana safidy tsara koa izahay
It was full of people.	feno olona izany
Sometimes people are really stupid.	tena adala ny olona indraindray
We are with them.	miaraka aminizy ireo isika
I hope to come to you soon.	manantena aho fa ho avy aminao tsy ho ela
Not good at all.	tsy tsara mihitsy
Absolutely wrong.	tena tsy mety
It did not find us there.	tsy nahita anay tany izy io
Then he saw the others.	dia nahita ny hafa izy
I don't think that's necessary.	heveriko fa tsy ilaina izany
Overall it works well.	aminny ankapobeny dia miasa tsara izany
The situation here seems completely different.	hita ho hafa tanteraka ny zavamisy eto
But it may not be the same.	saingy mety tsy izany koa
I am completely free.	afaka tanteraka aho
This seems to be the first thing that matters.	toa io no zavadehibe voalohany
Women had a choice.	nanana safidy ny vehivavy
And they are many.	ary betsaka izy ireo
Please.	mba kely
And they are free.	ary afaka izy ireo
But you just don’t do it.	saingy tsy manao izany tsotra izao ianao
It has the big and the potential.	manana ny lehibe sy ny mety
It’s no different with that problem.	tsy misy hafa aminizany olana izany
Or others.	na koa ny hafa
I have to get everything.	tsy maintsy mahazo ny zavadrehetra aho
But it shouldn’t be here or there.	saingy tsy tokony ho izany na eto na any
They are not immediately.	tsia avy hatrany izy ireo
Not alone, though.	tsy irery na izany aza
I know why.	fantatro ny antony
But then maybe it is.	fa avy eo angamba izany
There is nothing simple about it.	tsy misy zavatra tsotra momba izany
I needed something safe.	nila zavatra azo antoka aho
So we did and it was good.	dia nanao izany izahay ary dia tsara izany
He is also a most worthy person.	izy io koa dia olona mendrika indrindra
In general, it should be good.	aminny ankapobeny dia tokony ho tsara izany
Maybe he’ll come more.	angamba ho tonga bebe kokoa izy
This is a little closer to the house.	ity dia akaiky kely ny trano
It’s a lot of money.	tena vola be io
Or, if he dies.	na raha maty izy
It’s not going to be better than the others.	tsy hoe ho tsara kokoa noho ny hafa izany
You know that’s a fun idea.	fantatrao fa hevitra mahafinaritra izany
Because tonight more and more people don’t see themselves alone.	satria izao alina izao dia betsaka kokoa ny olona tsy mahita ny tenany irery
But time is everything.	fa ny fotoana no zavadrehetra
And we didn’t need that.	ary tsy nila izany izahay
He will not come to you.	tsy ho avy aminao izy
Especially those that aren’t yours.	indrindra fa ireo izay tsy anao
This is not a difficult choice.	tsy safidy sarotra izany
There were general and specific parts.	nisy ampahany ankapobeny sy manokana
Overall the world was good.	taminny ankapobeny dia tsara ny tontolo
The food always found him.	nahita azy foana ny sakafo
No one thought so either.	tsy nisy nieritreritra izany koa
There is a necessary environment around you.	misy tontolo ilaina manodidina anao
But I don’t see much more.	tsy mahita zavatra betsaka kokoa anefa aho
They are also not accustomed to it.	tsy mahazatra koa izy ireo aminizany
The little one.	ny kely
And they did a great job.	ary nanao asa lehibe izy ireo
I went to look.	nandeha nijery aho
Of course you are not.	mazava ho azy fa tsy izany ianao
Good things will come.	ho avy ny zavatra tsara
But it doesn’t come to matter.	saingy tsy tonga ho zavadehibe izany
I think we all did.	heveriko fa samy nanao izany isika rehetra
But not everything is completely lost.	tsy very tanteraka anefa ny zavadrehetra
But there is a problem.	misy olana anefa ao
This is very recent.	tena vao haingana izany
I don't need one.	tsy mila iray aho
He must have been with me.	azo antoka fa nisy tamiko izy
There is always another way.	misy fomba hafa foana
It was a house away from home.	trano lavitra ny trano izy io
Not that we did that much.	tsy hoe nanao izany be izahay
So it was the best of both worlds.	noho izany dia ny tsara indrindra taminny tontolo roa
He must die.	tsy maintsy maty izy
The idea is easily understood as follows.	ny hevitra dia mora azo araka ny manaraka
You are good but not now.	tsara ianao fa tsy izao
Here all the time.	eto ny fotoana rehetra
I just looked at them.	nijery azy ireo fotsiny aho
It’s a really good game.	lalao tena tsara izy io
There are steps and steps necessary to things.	misy dingana sy dingana ilaina aminny zavatra
We have another question.	manana fanontaniana hafa izahay
It is very real.	tena misy tokoa izany
And time went by.	ary nandeha ny fotoana
Or beautiful.	na tsara tarehy
You can never be one of them.	tsy afaka ny ho iray aminizy ireo mihitsy ianao
We all needed it.	nila izany izahay rehetra
If you get it, so much the better.	raha mahazo izany ianao dia tsara kokoa
But she did not know the truth about him.	tsy fantany anefa ny marina momba azy
It makes no sense to watch.	tsy misy dikany ny mijery
It is very difficult.	sarotra be izany
I think it takes time.	heveriko fa mila fotoana izany
And there are other things as well.	ary misy zavatra hafa koa
Bad, wrong.	ratsy diso
We have a very difficult day.	manana andro sarotra be isika
But soon it will be meaningless.	saingy tsy ho ela dia tsy hisy dikany izany
It’s easy to do the wrong thing.	mora ny manao zavatra tsy mety
But that’s not really part of the story.	saingy tsy izany mihitsy no ampahany aminny tantara
And he didn’t get us.	ary tsy nahazo antsika izy
We created a new world.	nanao tontolo vaovao izahay
You have to do something next time.	tsy maintsy manao zavatra ianao aminny manaraka
I would never have known they were.	tsy ho fantatro mihitsy hoe izy ireo
I went crazy once.	lasa adala aho indray mandeha
Once three.	indray mandeha telo
They got no money.	tsy nahazo vola izy ireo
The day is still young.	mbola kely ny andro
And that could be a good thing.	ary mety ho zavatra tsara izany
Not great, but not bad either.	tsy lehibe fa tsy ratsy koa
But he loved her so much.	tiany loatra anefa izy
Although the man died, he knew he was insecure.	na dia maty aza ilay lehilahy dia fantany fa tsy azo antoka izy
And they are men.	ary lehilahy izy ireo
And you go too fast.	ary mandeha haingana loatra ianao
But he did it, you did it.	saingy nanao izany izy nanao izany ianao
I never saw him again.	tsy nahita azy intsony aho
He is like in another world.	toy ny any aminny tontolo hafa izy
But he loves himself.	fa ny tenany no tiany
Both are on general options.	samy eo aminny safidy ankapobeny
Not much.	tsy dia betsaka
Which didn’t make sense to me.	izay tsy nisy dikany tamiko
It still exists.	mbola misy ihany
I want you to know something.	tiako ho fantatrao zavatra
This is no longer true.	tsy marina intsony izany
So every step of the process needs that.	ka ny dingana tsirairay aminny dingana dia mila izany
It’s always okay.	mety foana izany
You can do it as soon as you get it !.	afaka manao izany ianao raha vao azonao
It’s a good move.	hetsika tsara izany

A life has to go.	ny fiainana iray dia tsy maintsy mandeha
But this is not a war.	tsy ady anefa izany

Just like that, he left.	toy izany ihany lasa izy
They were mistreated.	natao ratsy izy ireo
Yes, they made more money.	eny nahazo vola bebe kokoa izy ireo
It’s a lovely house, very beautiful.	trano mahafinaritra io tena tsara tarehy
Maybe he was glad he had time to himself.	faly angamba izy nanana fotoana ho anny tenany
Otherwise we will be lost.	raha tsy izany dia ho very isika
So, just one last question.	noho izany fanontaniana iray farany fotsiny
Everything here is mine.	ahy ny zavatra rehetra eto
Here, he just couldn’t say.	eto tsy afaka nilaza fotsiny izy

When done.	rehefa natao
Most importantly, it comes perfectly together.	ny tena zavadehibe dia tonga miaraka tanteraka izy io

He was happy to do so.	faly izy nanao izany
And he may have been real some day.	ary mety ho tena nisy izy taminny andro sasany
Designed for you.	natao ho anao
Without it today, it will come again.	raha tsy misy izany anio dia ho avy indray izany
He doesn't seem to see anything else.	toa tsy mahita zavatra hafa izy
He then said he didn’t like it anymore.	nilaza izy avy eo fa tsy tiany intsony
But there are some problems.	misy anefa ny olana sasany
Not the real one.	tsy ilay tena izy
It is the most beautiful place in all of life.	io no toerana tsara tarehy indrindra aminny fiainana rehetra
Here, man.	eto lehilahy
I can't thank you !.	tsy afaka misaotra anao aho
Although he seems to be one.	na dia toa iray aza izy
The important thing.	ny zavadehibe
It doesn’t make sense at all.	tsy misy dikany mihitsy
But you haven’t done it yet.	saingy mbola tsy nanao izany ianao
They are two years old.	roa taona izy ireo
This is a simple task.	ity dia asa tsotra
Such a question is inappropriate.	ny fanontaniana toy izany dia tsy mety
No two.	tsy misy roa
This is the first problem.	izany no olana voalohany
Both are fun.	samy mahafinaritra
He is too busy.	be atao loatra izy
It could have all been done at the same time.	mety ho natao taminny fotoana iray ihany izy rehetra
It was too hard to get.	sarotra loatra ny nahazo azy
They are different now.	hafa izy ireo ankehitriny

But look, that’s the problem.	fa jereo izany no olana
This can be done in other ways.	azo atao aminny fomba hafa izany
Maybe even more.	mety mbola betsaka kokoa
You may not have even watched the end.	mety tsy nijery ny farany akory ianao
It’s not just me.	tsy ahy fotsiny izany
A lot of people love him.	be dia be ny olona tia azy
Thus, this information is meaningless.	araka izany tsy misy dikany izany vaovao izany
There is nothing wrong with that either.	tsy misy zavatra tsy mety koa ao
I disagree with him on this issue.	tsy mitovy hevitra aminy aho aminity resaka ity
Maybe they are better.	tsara kokoa angamba izy ireo
For them, it goes a long way.	ho azy ireo dia lavitra kokoa izany
But apparently, no.	saingy toa tsia
Yes for me.	eny ho ahy
I don't think you're crazy.	tsy heveriko fa adala ianao
I don’t know if he didn’t say he needed money.	tsy fantatro raha tsy nilaza izy fa mila vola
First of all, they are real photos.	voalohany indrindra sary tena izy ireo
But the world.	fa izao tontolo izao
We can do the same.	mety hanao toy izany koa isika
And of course he is.	ary mazava ho azy fa izy
The story is theirs.	azy ireo ny tantara
If so, they can have it.	raha izany no izy dia afaka manana izany izy ireo
But he seemed to love me.	toa tia ahy anefa izy

Very first step.	tena dingana voalohany
And everything is very fast.	ary tena haingana ny zavadrehetra
There are good and good reasons for this choice.	misy antony tsara sy tsara ho anio safidy io
The world is not fun without you.	tsy mahafinaritra izao tontolo izao raha tsy misy anao
That's not enough in the real world.	tsy ampy izany eo aminny tontolo tena izy
I have a lot here.	be dia be aho eto
No more questions.	tsy misy fanontaniana intsony
They are always there.	eo foana izy ireo
It can also be a very small thing.	mety ho zavatra kely dia kely ihany koa izany
All time is made for you.	ny fotoana rehetra dia natao ho anao
And we are really free.	ary tena afaka izahay
This is a very trivial matter.	olana tena tsy misy dikany izany
But there is something bigger about that.	saingy misy zavatra lehibe kokoa aminizany
And it will be a fun time.	ary ho fotoana mahafinaritra izany
You don’t need one anymore.	tsy mila iray intsony ianao
It is suitable for women.	mety ho anny vehivavy ilay izy
That sounds good to me.	toa tsara amiko izany
Please look at me.	mba jereo aho

You looked a little there.	nijery kely ianao tao
I love the game.	tiako ny lalao

He had manners and mannerisms.	nanana fomba sy fomba izy

You have something special.	manana zavatra manokana ianao
One of many.	iray aminny maro
But they are still working hard.	saingy mbola miasa mafy izy ireo
And you should too.	ary tokony koa ianao
We stopped too.	nijanona koa izahay
I had never seen him do that before.	mbola tsy nahita azy nanao izany mihitsy aho taloha
Despite this, he could not look around.	na dia teo aza izany dia tsy afaka nijery ny manodidina izy
It has always been, will always be.	efa nisy foana ho foana
In that case, it is absolutely impossible.	raha ny aminizany dia tsy azo atao mihitsy
And, they say, it’s too little.	ary hoy izy ireo dia kely loatra
It’s also possible.	mety ihany koa
I don’t want to be mistaken.	tsy te ho diso hevitra aho
He expects me too.	manantena ahy koa izy
It’s not that you’re talkative.	tsy hoe be resaka ianao
And he wants to be less than that.	ary tiany ho ambany noho izany izany
Yes, it is hard.	eny mafy izany
I went fast again.	nandeha haingana indray aho

You look around quickly.	mijery manodidina haingana ianao
It was a bit full.	somary feno ilay izy

I don’t have much of an idea.	tsy dia manana hevitra loatra aho

At other times, like now, he seems familiar.	aminny fotoana hafa toy ny ankehitriny toa mahazatra izy

There were others, of course.	nisy hafa mazava ho azy
I thank you for that.	misaotra anao aho noho izany
It just doesn’t do anything.	tsy manao na inona na inona fotsiny izany
Yeah, fun, really fun.	eny mahafinaritra tena mahafinaritra
I was able to do that job.	afaka nanao anio asa io aho
But there are many problems here.	misy olana maro anefa eto
He also liked the car.	tiany koa ilay fiara
However, he often had problems with it.	na izany aza matetika izy no nanana olana taminy
She really loves him again.	tena tia azy indray izy
Very good story.	tantara tena tsara
He was never wrong at night.	tsy diso alina mihitsy izy
That's my man.	izay ilay lehilahy ahy
They are not good for you.	tsy tsara aminao izy ireo
Maybe there shouldn’t be.	tsy tokony hisy angamba
It seems like this is too close.	toy ny hoe akaiky loatra ity
Looked at it.	nijery izany
We finally got news.	nahazo vaovao izahay taminny farany
But it’s all a different story.	saingy tantara hafa izany rehetra izany
That is the worst.	izay no ratsy indrindra
The night is gone.	lasa ny alina
He didn't look at me.	tsy nijery ahy izy
This is not always a good thing.	tsy zavatra tsara foana izany
We have the same fun things.	mitovy ny zavatra mahafinaritra anay
I have something else.	manana zavatra hafa aho
The truth is they are not.	ny marina dia tsy izy ireo
I think you might like him.	heveriko fa mety ho tianao izy
I know they did.	fantatro fa nanao izany izy ireo
Almost all of these pictures.	saika ireo sary rehetra ireo
But it is not his.	tsy azy anefa izany
I couldn’t have thought of anything better actually.	tsy afaka nieritreritra zavatra tsara kokoa aho raha ny marina
I even saw him sometimes.	nahita azy mihitsy aza aho indraindray
This task is generally very difficult.	ity asa ity aminny ankapobeny dia sarotra be
It is about all of us.	momba antsika rehetra izany
It is still special.	mbola manokana ihany ilay izy
It’s like you’re walking with him.	toy ny hoe mandeha miaraka aminy ianao
It is not necessary to do so.	tsy ilaina ny manao izany
Simply put, no one does it better.	tsotra fotsiny tsy misy manao izany tsara kokoa
There is no such problem.	tsy misy olana toy izany
I really like drawing.	tena tiako ny manao sary
Couldn’t be happier.	tsy mety ho faly kokoa
You didn’t say what the problem was.	tsy nilaza ianao hoe inona no olana
But now that path seems impossible.	saingy izao dia toa tsy azo atao intsony io lalana io
This may be the only possibility for him.	mety ho io ihany no mety ho azy
You are close.	akaiky ianao
Only you.	ianao ihany
It was almost fun.	saika nahafinaritra tokoa
Any night, by then.	na inona na inona alina aminizany
But to me it’s great.	fa amiko dia lehibe
This is too important.	zavadehibe loatra izany
I will not be the first.	tsy ho voalohany aho
Probably not.	angamba tsy misy
But they did it a long way.	saingy nanao izany taminny lalana lavitra izy ireo
This is clear to me and others.	mazava ho ahy sy ny hafa izany
There was no talk of it.	tsy nisy resaka momba izany
This can be done in many ways.	azo atao aminny fomba maro izany
I was glad to see both of them.	faly aho nahita azy roa
Right now there is no time.	aminizao fotoana izao dia tsy misy fotoana
They have come a long way.	efa lasa lavitra izy ireo
Don't be silly.	aza manao adala
It will be difficult one day.	sarotra izany indray andro any
Still to come of course.	mbola ho avy mazava ho azy
It is also very easy to do things wrong.	tena mora ihany koa ny manao zavatra diso
Yes, you understand why.	eny azonao ny antony
Now there is one more thing.	ankehitriny dia misy zavatra iray hafa
This is someone else.	olona hafa ity
I look different.	mijery hafa aho
The former is good.	ny eo aloha dia tsara
And here's one.	ary ity misy iray
Which in a way is him.	izay aminny fomba iray dia izy
Better than choice.	tsara kokoa noho ny safidy
To me, it’s fun.	amiko dia mahafinaritra
It is still new.	mbola vaovao ilay izy
One of these options seems like a good idea.	ny iray aminireo safidy ireo dia toa hevitra tsara
There is little work either.	tsy misy asa kely koa
All of these ideas are wrong.	diso daholo ireo hevitra ireo
Well, they deserve it.	tsara mendrika izany izy ireo
It doesn’t go far.	tsy tonga lavitra izany
Or such a time with the game.	na toy izany fotoana miaraka aminny lalao
You can't anymore.	tsy afaka intsony ianao
At first, it seems to work.	aminny voalohany dia toa miasa izany
Only work matters.	ny asa ihany no zavadehibe
No one told him.	tsy nisy nilaza taminy
It can only work for itself.	afaka miasa ho azy fotsiny izy io
You are not real.	tsy tena izy ianao
And in fact, you are doing well.	ary raha ny marina manao tsara ianao
You know you deserve it.	fantatrao fa mendrika izany ianao
We do it because it works.	manao izany izahay satria miasa
Nothing seems to be going well.	toa tsy misy zavatra mandeha tsara
And three are the least to me.	ary telo ny kely indrindra amiko
Of course, that made a lot of sense now.	mazava ho azy fa nisy dikany tanteraka izany ankehitriny
It was well done.	natao tsara izany
He was there.	teo izy teo
Really nice place.	tena toerana mahafinaritra
But there is much that can be done.	betsaka anefa ny azo atao
The word is that this is a bad thing.	ny teny dia hoe zavatra ratsy izany
These two things are not one and the same.	tsy iray sy iray ihany ireo zavatra roa ireo
Not stupid at first.	tsy adala aloha
People are only one of a thousand things.	iray aminireo zavatra iray alina fotsiny ny olona
It’s very uncertain.	tena tsy azo antoka izany
He will not do it.	tsy hanao izany izy
Do what is right, do what is wrong.	ataovy manao ny tsara ianao ataovy ny tsy mety
But that seems to be true.	saingy toa marina izany
If not, that’s fine too.	raha tsy izany dia tsara ihany koa izany
The requirements are as follows.	ny ilaina dia manaraka izao
And he wanted it to be.	ary tiany ho izy
This is what is important.	izao no zavadehibe
I'm dying .	maty aho
Of course, they saw nothing.	mazava ho azy fa tsy nahita na inona na inona izy ireo
So that is the problem.	ka io no olana
You can see it if you look closely.	afaka mahita izany ianao raha mijery mafy
I'm not very good.	tsy dia tsara loatra aho
He died recently.	maty vao haingana izy
I have died wrong before.	efa maty diso aho taloha
You have to do the right thing.	tsy maintsy manao ny tsara ianao
Really thought of him.	ny tena nieritreritra azy
Women are crazy about them.	adala aminizy ireo ny vehivavy
She must have had a man do it.	tsy maintsy nanana lehilahy nanao izany izy
There is news.	misy ny vaovao
You are a fool.	olona adala ianao
I know these are true.	fantatro fa marina ireo
And it has been.	ary efa nisy izany
He loves life.	tiany ny fiainana
And he’s having a great time.	ary manana fotoana mahafinaritra izy
Maybe another one.	angamba iray hafa
But not in the unworthy.	saingy tsy aminny tsy mendrika
No, not really.	tsia tsy tena
I didn't look at him.	tsy nijery azy aho
He doesn’t like small spaces.	tsy tia toerana kely izy
Almost everyone agrees.	saika mitovy hevitra aminizany ny olona rehetra
So don’t do it.	ka tsy manao izany
That’s what’s important.	izany no zavadehibe
The time should be now.	tokony ho izao ny fotoana
Everyone will be there.	ho any daholo
Absolutely not.	tena tsy izany
We hope they do, but they never do.	manantena izahay fa hanao izany izy ireo saingy tsy manao izany mihitsy
It looks bad to me.	toa ratsy izany aho
Then came the picture.	avy teo dia tonga taminny sary
Not everyone is there.	tsy ao daholo
I am completely yours.	anao tanteraka aho
Not if he doesn’t look.	tsy raha tsy mijery izy
Not a fun time.	tsy fotoana mahafinaritra
Life should be a life and not a conversation.	ny fiainana dia tokony ho fiainana fa tsy resaka
It was closer now, on him.	efa akaiky kokoa izany ankehitriny teo aminy
The woman did not seem happy.	toa tsy faly ilay vehivavy
I used to think there was.	nieritreritra aho taloha fa misy
In war we are one people.	aminny ady dia olona iray isika
The final step.	ny dingana farany
They are different for some reason.	tsy mitovy izy ireo noho ny antony sasany
You have nothing to lose, but they have a lot.	tsy manana na inona na inona ho very ianao fa manana be izy ireo
Even worse.	mbola ratsy lavitra
It's been too long.	efa ela loatra izao
But that’s something else.	fa izany no zavatra hafa
It looks like a face.	toa tarehy
It was fun, in a way.	nahafinaritra izany taminny fomba iray
And then it became a reality.	ary dia lasa zavamisy izany
Do you know where it is? 	fantatrao ny misy azy
No top.	tsy misy ambony
I went for it.	lasa izany aho
Not often, but not often.	tsy matetika fa tsy matetika
Now everything is going well.	ankehitriny dia mandeha ny zavatra rehetra
The former seems very simple.	toa tsotra be ilay taloha
It’s better for you.	tsara kokoa ho anao izany
They need other ideas.	mila hevitra hafa izy ireo
But now she loves him more.	tiany kokoa anefa izy izao
You couldn't say that.	tsy afaka nilaza izany ianao
It’s too hard for you.	sarotra loatra aminao izany
But for the most part, that’s what it is.	saingy aminny ankapobeny dia izany no izy
But none of that.	tsy misy aminizany anefa
But he was wrong.	fa izy no diso hevitra
This is the last good news.	izany no vaovao tsara farany
I can still walk.	mbola afaka mandeha aho
I don’t think there is much you can do.	heveriko fa tsy misy zavatra betsaka azonao atao
It can seem like a lot of hard work.	mety ho toa asa mafy be izany
And we do it together.	ary miaraka manao izany izahay
And maybe there’s nothing up there.	ary angamba tsy misy na inona na inona any ambony any
Every day is like every other day.	ny andro tsirairay dia toy ny andro rehetra
I know you have to do it.	fantatro fa tsy maintsy manao izany ianao
There was nothing there.	tsy nisy na inona na inona teo
It's a very vague word.	teny tsy mazava be io
There is no right or wrong.	tsy misy marina na diso
But they are not alone.	tsy irery anefa izy ireo
They are simple and easy.	mora sy mora izy ireo
Don’t get me wrong one.	aza diso hevitra ny iray
Best of all.	tsara indrindra aminny tontolo rehetra
That might make sense.	mety misy dikany izany
They don’t even seem to matter now.	toa tsy nisy dikany akory izy ireo ankehitriny
In general, both concepts make sense.	aminny ankapobeny dia misy dikany ireo hevitra roa ireo
The first is action.	ny voalohany dia ny hetsika
Maybe this is for sure.	angamba ity dia azo antoka
I enjoyed the trip.	nahafinaritra ahy ilay dia
True, this takes time.	marina fa mila fotoana izany
This is how the life to come should be.	tokony ho toy izany ny fiainana ho avy
Men are not women.	tsy vehivavy ny lehilahy
I love this one too.	tiako koa ity
It did more.	nanao bebe kokoa izany
We do this.	manao izao izahay
So is everything.	toy izany koa ny zavadrehetra
No, it's dead.	tsia maty izany
The idea seems very simple.	toa tsotra be ilay hevitra
There was a similar story in no.	nisy tantara mitovy aminizany taminny no
Well, thank you very much.	tsara misaotra indrindra
You deserve it.	mendrika izany ianao
There is a lot of work and everyone has a job.	betsaka ny asa ary manana asa ny olona rehetra
Actually above.	raha ny marina eo ambony eo
It's so crazy there, it's like going here.	adala be any toy ny hoe lasa eto
And that’s a lot.	ary betsaka izany
It might be too easy.	mety ho mora loatra izany
The facts are both uncertain.	ny zavamisy dia samy tsy azo antoka
She is having a great time.	manana fotoana mahafinaritra izy
Sometimes it seems good.	indraindray dia toa tsara
You should be.	tokony ho ianao
The question is almost identical to this one.	ny fanontaniana dia saika mitovy aminity iray ity
But not everything.	tsy ny zavadrehetra anefa
When he looked at me, he saw her.	rehefa nijery ahy izy dia nahita azy
But it’s true, yes.	saingy marina izany eny
Some came.	tonga ny sasany
Then you get there and it’s a really pointless place, man.	dia tonga any ianao ary tena toerana tsy misy dikany lehilahy
I have to work hard.	tsy maintsy miasa mafy aho
But now, no.	fa izao tsia
For the money, of course.	ho anny vola mazava ho azy
I don't see what was done.	tsy hitako izay natao
He is free.	afaka ihany izy
He didn’t really seem to go through with it.	toy ny tsy tena nandeha taminizany izy
Probably even the worst.	angamba na dia ny ratsy indrindra aza
The car is not faulty.	tsy diso ny fiara
Well, that’s good.	eny ary tsara izany
However, we got them.	na izany aza nahazo azy ireo izahay
You're a little like me.	mitovy kely amiko aza ianao
Once you can see the problem.	indray mandeha ianao dia afaka mahita ny olana
The problem is we can’t.	ny olana dia tsy afaka izahay
Then thank you very much.	dia misaotra betsaka
I love all of that too.	tiako izany rehetra izany koa
Exactly the same.	mitovy marina
What else is it.	inona koa izany
Around and around.	manodidina sy manodidina
Usually, he is right.	raha ny mahazatra dia marina izy
This is usually due to a simple small problem.	matetika izany dia noho ny olana tsotra kely
Maybe I didn’t see something very simple.	zavatra tena tsotra angamba no tsy hitako
However, you never know.	na izany aza tsy fantatrao mihitsy
He could still do it.	mbola afaka nanao izany izy
It will be ugly.	dia ho ratsy tarehy
Everything, no matter what, is the reason here.	ny zavadrehetra na inona na inona izany no antony eto
Not for him, but for me.	tsy ho azy fa ho ahy
Nice picture.	sary mahafinaritra
But of course, there are still big problems.	saingy mazava ho azy fa mbola misy ny olana lehibe
It doesn't work again.	tsy mandeha indray izany
It is not in the real world.	tsy ao aminny tontolo tena izy io
Or the news.	na ny vaovao
So here's another idea.	ka ity misy hevitra hafa
And he is not at all.	ary tsy izany mihitsy izy
However, it is not very simple.	na izany aza tsy tena tsotra izany
If not this year, maybe next time.	raha tsy aminity taona ity dia mety aminny manaraka
I have to look at these.	tsy maintsy mijery ireo aho
He was too close, not enough space.	akaiky loatra izy tsy ampy toerana
It is also far away.	lavitra koa izany
Opinions are very different.	tena samy hafa ny hevitra
It's been a long time coming.	efa ela izay no lasa
Apparently, he loved her too.	hita fa tia azy koa izy
They stayed with him.	nijanona teo aminy izy ireo
However, it is very different from this method.	na izany aza dia tena hafa noho io fomba io
In fact, he was too much.	raha ny marina dia be loatra izy
But it doesn’t go well.	saingy tsy mandeha tsara
Nothing unusual.	tsy misy zavatra mahazatra
They are confused.	very hevitra izy ireo
But now is an unusual time.	fotoana tsy mahazatra anefa izao
Yes, he certainly gets his.	eny azo antoka fa mahazo ny azy izy
He just needed a little more space.	nila toerana kely kokoa fotsiny izy
Such is the reality.	toy izany ny zavamisy
Surely no one has ever said such a thing.	azo antoka fa tsy mbola nisy olona nilaza zavatra toy izany
Now, you know me.	ankehitriny fantatrao aho
It can't be.	tsy mety ho izy io
You can do whatever you want with it.	afaka manao izay tianao ianao aminizany
I don't even know.	tsy fantany akory aho
I never thought of anything like that.	tsy nieritreritra zavatra toy izany aho
But that's probably why.	fa izay angamba no antony
There will never be a better time.	tsy hisy fotoana tsara kokoa
And it couldn’t be more accurate right now.	ary tsy mety ho marina kokoa izany aminizao fotoana izao
He couldn't do it now.	tsy afaka nanao izany izy izao
I got them more often.	nahazo azy ireo matetika kokoa aho
There is still time.	mbola misy ny fotoana
I have no one in this place.	tsy manana olona aho aminity toerana ity
This is a difficult problem.	olana sarotra izany
He did not say why.	tsy nilaza ny antony izy
Of course, for a good reason.	mazava ho azy fa noho ny antony lehibe
And no news.	ary tsy misy vaovao
He probably didn’t come alone.	tsy tonga irery angamba izy
He is in the wrong place.	ao aminny toerana ratsy izy
But that was many years ago.	fa efa taona maro lasa izay
I want it for them.	te ho azy ireo aho
Lots of work.	be dia be ny asa
It is never complete.	tsy feno mihitsy izany
What a problem.	inona no olana
We also had no money.	tsy nanana vola koa izahay
Normally, there were no problems.	raha ny mahazatra dia tsy nisy olana
Just tonight.	anio alina fotsiny
These are just words.	teny fotsiny ireo
However, this process is not very long.	tsy tena ela anefa io dingana io
If only they had come to see.	raha mba tonga nijery izy ireo
It seems almost pointless.	toa saika tsy misy dikany izany
But that doesn’t happen automatically.	saingy tsy mandeha ho azy izany
But for once, it wasn’t there.	saingy indray mandeha dia tsy nisy izany
Everything comes first.	ny zavadrehetra avy dia tena voalohany
You may need to hope.	mety mila manantena ianao
Thanks for a great day.	misaotra taminny andro mahafinaritra
There was a man there, but he was nowhere to be seen.	nisy lehilahy teo saingy tsy hita
It was a wonderful night.	nahafinaritra be ilay alina
It was really fun to do.	tena nahafinaritra ny nanao izany
He may not have.	mety tsy nanana izy
It works well if you don’t have it right now.	miasa tsara izy io raha tsy misy anao aminizao fotoana izao
I had no problem with that.	tsy nanana olana taminizany
That is the reality.	izay no zavamisy marina
Simple, they say.	tsotra hoy izy ireo
Not too long ago, for you.	tsy ela akory izay ho anao
I don’t think he saw many.	heveriko fa tsy nahita maro izy
He knew it wouldn't happen.	fantany fa tsy hisy izany
But it is near.	efa akaiky anefa izany
And so it is with you.	ary toy izany koa ny aminao
But he is very good.	tena tsara be anefa izy
He seems smaller.	toa kely kokoa izy
I want it for you.	tiako ho anao izany
He didn’t go for it.	tsy nandeha taminizany izy
Do it over and over again.	ataovy hatrany hatrany hatrany
Yes, there is worse news.	eny misy vaovao ratsy kokoa
Yes, better.	eny tsara kokoa
Everything else is part of an idea.	ny zavatra hafa rehetra dia ampahany aminny hevitra iray
It’s just not the same.	tsy mitovy fotsiny izany
It will be easier.	ho mora kokoa izany
All about everything.	rehetra momba ny zavadrehetra
He couldn’t do it often, he said.	tsy afaka nanao izany matetika izy hoy izy
Just look at this thing.	jereo fotsiny ity zavatra ity
We can have a good life here.	afaka manana fiainana tsara isika eto
He is still far away.	mbola lavitra izy
Here’s something more important.	ity misy zavadehibe kokoa
But they need to be sure.	mila mahazo antoka anefa izy ireo
A little more often this year.	somary matetika kokoa aminity taona ity
The same is true today.	toy izany koa ny aminizao andro izao
But he is still walking.	mbola mandeha ihany anefa izy
There were even bigger problems.	nisy olana lehibe kokoa koa
So, you know.	noho izany fantatrao
Nothing for sure, of course.	tsy misy azo antoka mazava ho azy
Yes, they saw me.	eny nahita ahy izy ireo
Come on next.	tonga aminny manaraka
Very little but for sure.	tena kely fa azo antoka
A lot was done.	be dia be ny natao
Some easy problems.	ny olana mora sasany
It was very easy for me personally.	tena mora tamiko manokana izany
Not that night.	tsy io alina io
We have to do it all over again.	tsy maintsy manao izany indray isika indray mandeha
Hard, that is.	mafy izany
I don't see anything that might work.	tsy mahita na inona na inona mety miasa aho
I have everything and not enough of everything.	manana ny zavadrehetra aho ary tsy ampy ny zavadrehetra
It’s something, everything.	zavatra io zavatra rehetra
The work will be hard or not.	ny asa dia ho mafy na tsy ho
And finally, they can.	ary farany mety izy ireo
It's a nice picture.	tsara sary ilay izy
They will deserve it in the end.	ho mendrika izany izy ireo aminny farany
It seems like a long time ago now.	toa efa ela be izany ankehitriny
But this is a fact.	tena zavamisy anefa izany
I hope you get it.	manantena aho fa azonao izany
Yes, there is one more little thing.	eny misy zavatra kely iray hafa
She loves the next one.	tiany ny manaraka
These results must be yes or no.	tsy maintsy eny na tsia ireo vokatra ireo
So we thank you.	noho izany dia misaotra anao izahay
Only one person is with him.	olona iray ihany no miaraka aminy
He got what he wanted.	nahazo izay tiany izy
It may not be pretty, but it’s not dead.	tsy tsara tarehy angamba izy io saingy tsy maty
Surely someone did.	azo antoka fa nisy olona nanao izany
But it is hard work.	asa mafy anefa izany
They need to be with you.	mila miaraka aminao izy ireo
Easy to work with.	mora miasa
One and one are always the same two.	ny iray sy ny iray dia mitovy foana ny roa
They also seem insecure.	toa tsy azo antoka koa izy ireo
And they have it now.	ary manana izany izy ireo ankehitriny
You’re different, and that’s a good thing.	hafa ianao ary zavatra tsara izany
It's the same man.	lehilahy iray ihany io
Then he stopped dead.	dia nijanona maty
Therefore, the larger this product, the smaller itself.	noho izany ny lehibe kokoa ity vokatra ity ny kely kokoa ny tenany
But it was good for me.	saingy tsara ho ahy izany
Everything will be as usual, in fact.	ho toy ny mahazatra ny zavadrehetra raha ny marina
So, you just got here.	noho izany tonga eto ihany ianao
The world is not like that, it is no longer.	tsy toy izany izao tontolo izao tsy izany intsony
This game is a game.	lalao io lalao io
Only the best will do.	ny tsara indrindra ihany no hanao
It's all gone.	very daholo
But then he died.	fa maty izy avy eo
Which is a good thing.	izay zavatra tsara
I really have no idea from here on out.	tena tsy manana hevitra avy eto aho
They are for me.	ho ahy izy ireo
It could be anything.	mety ho ny zavadrehetra
The food is also good.	tsara koa ny sakafo
So am I.	toy izany koa aho
I never want to lose it.	tsy tiako ho very izany mihitsy
The day will become a year.	ny andro dia ho lasa taona
Time is everything.	ny fotoana no zavadrehetra
He almost lost his job.	saika very asa izy
But he is too.	fa izy koa
But it should be.	saingy tokony ho izany
I have to disagree there.	tsy maintsy tsy mitovy hevitra aho eo
Reality of life.	zavamisy eo aminny fiainana
In fact, she is beautiful.	raha ny marina tsara tarehy izy
Very fun game.	lalao tena mahafinaritra
Then he knew.	dia fantany avy eo
I hope you enjoyed them.	manantena aho fa nahafinaritra anao izy ireo
A world where anything is possible.	tontolo izay azo atao na inona na inona
They all seem to have gone far, far away.	toa lasa lavitra izy rehetra izao lavitra be
Maybe this, right.	angamba ity marina
He seemed happy to see me.	toa faly izy nahita ahy
Then the other man left.	dia lasa ilay lehilahy hafa
And it’s all mine.	ary izany rehetra izany dia ahy
You’re dead and you don’t know it.	maty ianao ary tsy fantatrao izany
It just doesn’t go the other way.	tsy mandeha aminny fomba hafa fotsiny izany
Both are very good.	samy tsara be
He is now the last man.	izy izao no lehilahy farany
He knew he had to have it.	fantany fa tsy maintsy manana izany izy
I didn’t see anything at first.	tsy nahita na inona na inona aho taminny voalohany
I have nothing to lose.	tsy manana na inona na inona ho very aho
No one has ever looked at me like this.	tsy mbola nisy nijery ahy toy izao
That's enough, right.	ampy izay marina
No one sees it.	tsy misy mahita izany
Stupid idea.	hevitra adala
But maybe it’s more than that.	fa angamba efa mihoatra noho izany
I think everyone has to do it now.	heveriko fa tsy maintsy hanao izany ny rehetra ankehitriny
It doesn’t seem to see the way.	toa tsy mahita ny lalana
The things pictured can be good or bad.	ny zavatra sary dia mety ho tsara na ratsy
It’s nothing if it’s not clear.	tsy inona izy raha tsy mazava
Such a choice is perfectly possible.	azo atao tsara ny safidy toy izany
It makes more sense.	misy dikany kokoa
He’s not the type.	tsy izy no karazana
But, yes, it is not perfect.	saingy eny tsy tanteraka izany
However, this place is safe !.	na izany aza ity toerana ity dia azo antoka
There is no house.	tsy misy trano
We need to do that.	mila manao izany isika
I had this problem too.	nanana ity olana ity koa aho
Yes, almost alone.	eny saika irery
Great idea.	hevitra mahafinaritra
It will become your own.	ho lasa anao manokana izany
All about it is lost.	very daholo ny momba izany
The work, he said, seemed impossible.	ny asa hoy izy dia toa tsy azo atao
I'm not like that.	tsy toy izany aho
He is completely alone here.	irery tanteraka izy eto
There are others like that.	misy ny hafa mitovy aminizany
They could say what they wanted.	afaka nilaza izay tiany izy ireo
You have nothing to lose.	tsy misy ho very ianao
For many people, work is a difficult task.	ho anny olona maro dia asa sarotra ny miasa
There are many more.	misy maro hafa
The good news is you get another top option.	ny vaovao tsara dia mahazo safidy ambony hafa ianao
I know you need something more.	fantatro fa mila zavatra bebe kokoa ianao
He did come.	tonga tokoa izy
They are all dead.	efa maty daholo izy ireo
You are really free now.	tena afaka tokoa ianao izao
They both don’t like to be here.	samy tsy tia ny ho eto izy roa
And they had to do that work first.	ary tsy maintsy nanao izany asa izany aloha izy ireo
Higher than that.	ambony noho izany
I really like this option.	tena tiako io safidy io
And there were too many of us then.	ary be loatra izahay taminizany
And that's not good.	ary tsy tsara izany
The same is true, as can be seen.	toy izany koa araka ny hita
Finally, the woman died too.	farany maty koa ilay vehivavy
I love this place and this trip.	tiako ity toerana ity sy ity dia ity
Well, you better.	eny ary tsara kokoa ianao
People are dying here.	maty ny olona eto
Thanks for everything guys.	misaotra aminny zavadrehetra lehilahy
This is probably the best thing to do.	izany angamba no tsara indrindra atao
They are just different than you.	samy hafa noho ny anao fotsiny izy ireo
This is not a matter of opinion.	tsy resaka hevitra izany
We will.	ho isika
It can be a fun thing to do.	mety ho zavatra mahafinaritra ny manao izany
I love you for that.	tiako ianao noho izany
We really enjoyed it.	tena nahafinaritra anay izany
Or maybe earlier.	na angamba aloha
It’s not just the road that was made.	tsy ny lalana ihany no natao
Of course, it can't.	mazava ho azy fa tsy afaka izany
Yes, they all go.	eny mandeha daholo izy ireo
And it didn’t go well.	ary tsy nandeha tsara izany
This is a great place.	toerana tena tsara izany
I still need to do that.	mbola mila manao izany aho
said another.	hoy ny iray hafa
There was a woman inside.	nisy vehivavy tao anatiny
No, we didn’t.	tsia tsy nanao izany izahay
But in fact, little was found.	saingy raha ny marina dia tsy dia nisy zavatra hita
But they are not like that.	tsy mba toy izany anefa izy ireo
Then you do.	dia manao izany ianao
If he said that, it must be true.	raha nilaza izany izy dia tsy maintsy ho marina izany
And it wasn’t done alone.	ary tsy natao irery izany
And he soon died.	ary tsy ela dia maty izy
Yes, they thought of everything.	eny nieritreritra ny zavadrehetra izy ireo
This is my favorite.	ity no tiako indrindra
One time passed, there was another and another.	nandeha ny fotoana iray dia nisy iray hafa ary iray hafa
You can’t do that without them in a way.	tsy afaka manao izany ianao raha tsy misy azy ireo aminny fomba iray
To even be there.	mba ho any aza
Now he has to do something.	ankehitriny dia tsy maintsy manao zavatra izy
The game I don’t fully know.	ny lalao dia tsy fantatro tanteraka
Such a thing is not suitable for women.	tsy mety aminny vehivavy ny zavatra toy izany
Everything seems normal.	toa mahazatra ny zavadrehetra
He is very right here.	tena marina izy eto
There was no one like them.	tsy nisy olona toa azy ireo
Hard work, hard work.	asa sarotra sarotra
But all this makes no sense.	saingy tsy misy dikany izany rehetra izany
It's not very convenient.	tsy dia mety loatra izany
Of course, this is not necessary.	mazava ho azy fa tsy ilaina izany
And then this.	ary avy eo ity
No one was with him.	tsy nisy olona teo aminy
Of course not, they said.	mazava ho azy fa tsia hoy izy ireo

If any.	raha nisy
It’s not good but it’s normal.	tsy tsara izany fa efa mahazatra
It’s not hard to get men.	tsy sarotra ny mahazo ny lehilahy
But he wasted no time.	tsy very fotoana anefa izy
The problem is none of them ever do that.	ny olana dia tsy misy aminizy ireo mihitsy no manao izany
He kept looking.	nijery foana izy
No longer needed.	tsy ilaina intsony
He will surely come.	ho avy tokoa izy
You could have done more.	afaka nanao bebe kokoa ianao
Look at the first picture.	jereo ny sary voalohany
And that's wrong.	ary diso izany
I like it, though.	tiako izany na dia
I said, good job.	hoy aho hoe asa tsara
He cannot die.	tsy mety maty izy
Really fun, but no.	tena mahafinaritra fa tsia
But no one goes there.	saingy tsy misy olona mandeha any
They stopped walking.	nijanona nandeha izy ireo
I think things are moving very fast.	heveriko fa haingana dia haingana ny zavamisy
However, it was made for me.	na izany aza dia natao ho ahy izany
Hard times in life.	fotoana sarotra aminny fiainana
The choice of each word.	ny safidy teny tsirairay
I know you must be confused.	fantatro fa tsy maintsy ho very hevitra ianao
A little too hard.	somary mafy loatra
I don’t want you to know the truth.	tsy tiako ho fantatrao ny marina
The choice is yours and yours alone.	anao ary anao irery ny safidy
He thought for the night.	nieritreritra ny alina izy
I don't need them anymore.	tsy mila azy ireo intsony aho
We have nothing left to lose.	tsy misy ho very intsony isika
Then there is the earth.	avy eo dia misy ny tany
He wanted her to be the same.	tiany ho toy izany koa izy
Sooner or later, there will be a war.	na ho ela na ho haingana dia tsy maintsy hisy ny ady
Maybe they need time with you.	angamba mila fotoana miaraka aminao izy ireo
He looked up.	nijery ambony izy
Na, na, na.	na na na
We are going there now.	mandeha any izahay izao
If he did something, he died.	raha nanao zavatra izy dia maty izy
But this nonsense picture is not true.	tsy marina anefa io sary tsy misy dikany io
Or the next.	na ny manaraka
And it’s very difficult.	ary sarotra be
People talking.	ny olona manao resaka
Only people can.	ny olona ihany no afaka
I should be more.	tokony ho bebe kokoa aho
It doesn’t matter to you.	tsy misy dikany aminao izany
And you may be right.	ary mety ho marina ianao
Life was enough for him.	efa ampy ho azy ny fiainana
I had to go well.	tsy maintsy nandeha tsara aho
It’s a real job.	asa tena izy io
It is not a specific question at all.	tsy fanontaniana manokana mihitsy ilay izy
He is still there.	mbola eo izy
He must have been thinking of you.	tsy maintsy ho nieritreritra anao izy
This is just the beginning.	vao vao manomboka izany
Here is a nice picture.	ity misy sary mahafinaritra
But for him.	fa ho azy
He started looking at her.	nanomboka nijery azy izy
He is the world for him.	izao tontolo izao ho azy izy
One is, of course, a really bad job.	ny iray dia mazava ho azy fa asa tena ratsy
I will be no more.	tsy hisy intsony aho
It’s not very clear.	tsy dia mazava loatra izany
But only a little.	saingy kely fotsiny
The weather can be very bad.	mety ho ratsy be ny andro
I think it works.	heveriko fa miasa izany
Then they both had ideas.	avy eo dia samy nanana hevitra izy ireo
Yes, we will love people.	eny ho tia olona isika
It may be possible, now.	mety ho azo atao izany izao
They can do whatever they want, he thought.	afaka manao izay tiany izy ireo hoy izy nieritreritra
I know that, because mine do too.	fantatro izany satria ny ahy koa
This can be done as follows.	izany dia azo atao toy ny manaraka
It seemed good to him.	toa tsara taminy izany
We only stayed one night.	indray alina ihany izahay no nijanona
It could be something else.	mety ho zavatra hafa izany
We don’t need an argument.	tsy mila ady hevitra izahay
No, it will be safer.	tsia ho azo antoka kokoa izany
That's it.	izany no azy
Of course we get a lot.	mazava ho azy fa mahazo betsaka isika
We traveled a long way.	nandeha lavitra izahay
There is no right or wrong process.	tsy misy dingana mety na diso
They are not even dead.	tsy maty akory izy ireo
The new year will be better.	ho tsara kokoa ny taona vaovao
But there is still a long way to go.	mbola lavitra anefa ny lalana
This last part doesn’t work.	ity ampahany farany ity dia tsy mandeha
He never needed it.	tsy nila izany mihitsy izy
He looked at the money.	nijery ilay vola izy
Eventually the woman was gone.	taminny farany dia lasa ilay vehivavy
I will be a man.	ho lehilahy aho
Life is hard.	sarotra ny fiainana
But that is not the point here.	tsy izany anefa no hevitra eto
That kind of thing.	izany karazana zavatra izany
It works well.	miasa tsara izy io
But that can be a lot of things.	mety ho zavatra maro be anefa izany
In fact, there was some money to be made.	nisy ihany ny vola azo raha ny marina
He had to do something.	tsy maintsy nanao zavatra izy
This is clear.	hita mazava izany
There were no pictures, for personal reasons.	tsy nisy sary izany noho ny antony manokana
And then, there’s also the unrealistic reason.	ary avy eo misy ihany koa ny antony tsy tena izy
They just don’t exist.	tsy misy fotsiny izy ireo
But with a lot of stuff.	saingy miaraka aminny zavatra be dia be
He has yet to see action.	mbola tsy nahita hetsika izy
It is as if they are still there.	toy ny hoe misy ao ihany izy ireo
They make more money than you do.	mahazo vola be noho ianao izy ireo
He is now.	izy izao
Once you get there.	raha vao tonga any ianao
But not all methods are good.	saingy tsy ny fomba rehetra no tsara
True, he does.	marina fa manao izany izy
You even saw the car.	nahita ny fiara mihitsy aza ianao
Go walk.	mandeha mandeha
I have never had a problem like this.	mbola tsy nanana olana toy izao aho
He can see.	afaka mahita izy
This is also the fastest.	izao koa no haingana indrindra
Another quick question.	fanontaniana haingana iray hafa
So don't thank us.	koa aza misaotra anay
They are not, really, not alone.	tsy izy ireo tena tsy irery
Then the whole process begins.	avy eo dia manomboka ny dingana rehetra
I usually do other things.	matetika aho no manao zavatra hafa
Very useful in many ways.	tena ilaina aminny fomba maro
It might be easier to work with.	mety ho mora kokoa ny miasa
I recently died.	vao haingana aho no maty
But it is not necessary.	saingy tsy ilaina izany
And even if he had, it doesn’t make sense now.	ary na dia nanana aza izy dia tsy misy dikany izany ankehitriny
He was already there.	efa tany izy
Once upon a time, in fact.	indray mandeha raha ny marina
I can't find it.	tsy hitako io
This has never happened before.	tsy mbola nisy toy izany mihitsy
Everything is so bad.	tena ratsy daholo ny rehetra
There was a similar problem.	nisy olana mitovy aminizany
Simpler is better.	ny tsotra no tsara kokoa
That's it.	dia izay ary
In fact, we have already said so.	raha ny marina efa nilaza izany izahay
Either one way or the other.	na ny fomba iray na ny hafa
It is very easy to do.	tena mora ny manao azy io
For some reason, we couldn’t go.	noho ny antony sasany dia tsy afaka nandeha izahay
And sometimes, you just need to make one for yourself.	ary indraindray mila manao iray ho anao fotsiny ianao
And they are very happy people.	ary olona tena faly izy ireo
And it's very different.	ary hafa mihitsy izany
So this is going to be pretty cool.	noho izany dia ho avy tsara tarehy ity
Not without me.	tsy raha tsy misy ahy
But, it’s fun.	saingy mahafinaritra izany
The land is lost.	very ny tany
This is all very new.	tena vaovao daholo izany
I know it’s hard.	fantatro fa mafy izany
He got time for her right away.	nahazo fotoana taminy avy hatrany izy
And so the place may have stopped.	ary noho izany dia mety ho nijanona ny toerana
Very useful for.	tena ilaina ho anny
The old fool.	ilay adala taloha
And he still hasn't come.	ary mbola tsy tonga ihany izy
The same house.	ilay trano ihany
There are three products, each of which is very familiar.	misy vokatra telo ny tsirairay dia tena mahazatra
I got a seat.	nahazo toerana aho
Even if he did.	na dia nanao izany aza izy
However, no action was found.	na izany aza tsy misy hetsika hita
Almost a completely different game.	saika lalao hafa tanteraka
Our common problem is the world.	ny olana mahazatra antsika dia izao tontolo izao
Right now they have no idea how.	aminizao fotoana izao dia tsy manana hevitra momba ny fomba izy ireo
No one had, of course.	tsy nisy nanana mazava ho azy
He was just too fast.	haingana be fotsiny izy
It doesn't come from nothing.	tsy avy aminny tsy misy izany
I enjoy life.	mahafinaritra ahy ny fiainana
Then it’s all gone.	dia lasa daholo
Yes, he did, and even worse.	eny nanao izany izy ary mbola ratsy kokoa
He got a job.	nahazo asa izy
He hadn't known for a long time.	efa ela no tsy fantany
I think you do the same.	heveriko fa manao toy izany koa ianao
Each step is difficult.	sarotra ny dingana tsirairay
I don’t like it very much.	tsy dia tiako loatra
He doesn't know what's around.	tsy fantany izay manodidina
It didn’t matter much if he told her the truth.	tsy dia zavadehibe loatra raha nilaza taminy ny marina izy
All of this is very good.	tena tsara daholo izany rehetra izany
This is kind of.	ity dia karazana iray
He will be there.	ho any izy
So, a small step.	noho izany dingana kely
We often do that.	matetika izahay no manao izany
I've seen them before.	nahita azy ireo aho taloha
Really nothing goes around him.	tena tsy misy mandeha manodidina azy
I look at them now.	mijery azy ireo aho izao
You can go there.	afaka mandeha any ianao
I had already done something then.	efa nanao zavatra aho taminizany
And it’s not just life.	ary tsy fiainana fotsiny izany
If only we had more time.	raha mba nanana fotoana bebe kokoa izahay
It shouldn’t be long.	tsy tokony ho ela izany
You don't need me then.	tsy mila ahy ianao raha izany
It’s really fun.	tena mahafinaritra tokoa
Surely you are good.	azo antoka fa tsara ianao
Down again.	any ambany indray
It's really not fun, 'he said.	tena tsy mahafinaritra hoy izy

The product itself.	ny vokatra mihitsy
Everything went well.	nandeha tsara ny rehetra
I know it has to be possible.	fantatro fa tsy maintsy azo atao izany
And saw nothing.	ary tsy nahita na inona na inona
Still, it seems normal.	toa mahazatra ihany anefa ilay izy
Just see everything.	mahita ny zavadrehetra fotsiny
Strong and clear.	mafy sy mazava
He seems to be like that.	toa toy izany izy
Everything seems fine.	toa tsara ny zavadrehetra
You can see it.	afaka mahita izany
The last days are near.	efa akaiky ny andro farany
He did what he knew.	nanao izay fantany izy
He is not of this world.	tsy avy aminizao tontolo izao izy
Another quick question.	fanontaniana haingana hafa
That’s the simple way.	izany no fomba tsotra
You probably thought you could watch.	nieritreritra angamba ianao fa afaka mijery
There may be a future.	mety hisy ho avy izany
He still walks when he can.	mbola mandeha izy rehefa afaka
It looks really fun.	toa mahafinaritra tokoa
It could be so much more than that.	mety ho mihoatra lavitra noho izany izany
You need it hard.	mila mafy ianao
You can start small.	afaka manomboka kely ianao
It seems to be possible.	hita fa mety

He saw something familiar.	nahita zavatra mahazatra izy
Or they die.	na maty izy ireo
And looked at me.	ary nijery ahy
I'm nothing to you.	tsy zavatra aminao aho
They become too frequent.	lasa matetika loatra izy ireo
I am here for you.	eto aho ho anao
But he loved the story.	tiany anefa ilay tantara
The man came for you again.	tonga ho anao indray ny lehilahy

Sometimes it seems the same.	toa izany ihany indraindray
It seems difficult.	toa sarotra izany
He won't go far.	tsy ho lasa lavitra any izy

I couldn't be without it now.	tsy afaka ny tsy teo aho izao
A new day has come.	tonga ny andro vaovao
To be lost.	mba ho very
And we see a lot of people who have nothing.	ary mahita olona betsaka tsy manana na inona na inona isika
Life is never clear.	tsy mazava mihitsy ny fiainana
Everything is food.	ny zavadrehetra dia sakafo
Make it real now.	ataovy tena izy izao
These are true, of course.	marina tokoa ireo mazava ho azy
However, it may be necessary.	na izany aza dia mety ho ilaina
But that can never be wrong.	tsy mety diso mihitsy anefa izany
What a story.	inona ny tantara
That might be a good idea.	mety tsara angamba izany
They work hard and expect you to do the same.	miasa mafy izy ireo ary manantena anao hanao toy izany koa
I hope you like him.	manantena aho fa tianao izy
Not again.	tsy izany indray
You have said all that before.	efa nilaza izany rehetra izany ianao taloha
To him or to me.	aminy na amiko
Some may have to go.	misy angamba tsy maintsy mandeha
In this way, there is nothing.	aminity fomba ity dia tsy misy na inona na inona
Thanks so much.	misaotra indrindra
I don't see the latter.	tsy hitako ilay farany
I've seen it all.	efa hitako daholo
It’s all really new, for everyone.	tena vaovao daholo izany ho azy rehetra
That’s good, he said.	tsara izany hoy izy
And make sure he gets food too.	ary ataovy azo antoka fa mahazo sakafo koa izy
This may seem too common.	mety ho hita ho mahazatra loatra izany
But there is one.	saingy misy iray
It seems new.	toa vaovao izany
But there are.	misy ihany anefa
He knows what.	fantany hoe inona
We have been doing this for a long time.	efa ela izahay no nanao izany
And that’s true, but you’re wrong.	ary marina izany saingy diso hevitra ianao
Still not that.	mbola tsy izay ihany
Even better, in fact.	na tsara kokoa aza raha ny marina
And if so, good for you.	ary raha izany dia tsara ho anao
They are easier now than ever before.	mora kokoa izy ireo ankehitriny noho ny teo aloha
She is beautiful and free.	tsara tarehy izy ary afaka
This seemed common at the time.	toa mahazatra izany taminizany fotoana izany
Now that seems to be the case.	ankehitriny dia toa izany no zavamisy
Maybe we didn’t even have a reason.	tsy nanana antony akory angamba isika
He didn’t even have it for himself.	tsy nanana na dia ho anny tenany aza izy
If anything, he’s very good.	raha misy dia tena tsara izy
He began to think of other things as well.	nanomboka nieritreritra zavatra hafa koa izy
In fact, this guy is too much.	raha ny marina be loatra io lehilahy io
This is more important.	zavadehibe kokoa izany
So no problem with that.	ka tsy misy olana aminizany
He died instantly.	maty avy hatrany izy
It is not.	tsy izany
We have to have one or the other.	tsy maintsy manana iray na iray hafa isika
No one thought of him anymore.	tsy nisy nieritreritra azy intsony
They are still young.	mbola kely izy ireo
We are very sure.	tena azo antoka izahay
But it goes really well.	mandeha tena lehibe anefa izy io
You will never get it.	tsy ho azonao mihitsy izany
That sounds bad to me.	toa ratsy amiko izany
Soon, for sure.	tsy ho ela azo antoka
They could have done good or evil.	afaka nanao ny tsara na ny ratsy izy ireo
But again, they may not be.	saingy indray mety tsy izy ireo
He knew what he was.	fantany hoe inona izy
I am free now.	afaka aho izao
Some are smaller.	ny sasany dia kely kokoa
But the future may not be like that.	mety tsy ho toy izany anefa ny ho avy
I never saw him.	tsy hitako mihitsy izy
This is another option.	safidy indray ity
But you already know that idea.	saingy efa fantatrao io hevitra io
But some work.	fa ny sasany dia miasa
It’s normal for him.	mahazatra azy izany
Thank you for making me do that.	misaotra anao nanao ahy hanao izany
But still good.	fa mbola tsara
They don’t work.	tsy manao asa izy ireo
Then he did something worthwhile.	nanao zavatra mendrika izy avy eo
We cannot do it without it.	tsy afaka manao izany isika raha tsy misy izany
He wanted to do the best for me.	te hanao ny tsara indrindra ho ahy izy
Of course, that's good.	mazava ho azy fa tsara izany
I think the money is small.	heveriko fa kely ny vola
Often.	matetika
I never needed more than that.	mbola tsy nila mihoatra noho izany mihitsy aho
However, this may not be the case either.	na izany aza mety tsy mety koa izany
He quickly looked at the house.	nijery haingana ny trano izy
If he said he had it, he had it.	raha nilaza izy fa nanana azy dia nanana azy izy
And look at two things first.	ary jereo ny zavatra roa aloha
The options can be many.	ny safidy dia mety ho maro
But all of this is wrong.	diso anefa izany rehetra izany
Just made sure they watched it.	natao antoka fotsiny fa nijery izany izy ireo
They are ideas, nothing else.	hevitra izy ireo tsy misy hafa
One and two.	iray sy roa
That they are not real.	ny hoe tsy tena izy ireo
For good reason, too.	aminny antony tsara koa
No time was lost.	tsy nisy fotoana very
So, you generally have a timeless period.	noho izany aminny ankapobeny dia manana fotoana tsy misy taona ianao
He had never been very happy before.	mbola tsy tena faly mihitsy izy taloha
I really enjoyed it there.	tena nahafinaritra ahy tany
But there is more.	mbola betsaka kokoa anefa izao
He is in the picture.	izy no ao aminny sary
If so, the story is meaningless.	raha izany no izy dia tsy misy dikany ny tantara
It’s not too far away.	tsy dia lavitra loatra izany
Now and in the future.	ankehitriny sy ho avy
The place was almost full.	saika feno ilay toerana
There was plenty of food.	nisy sakafo be dia be
I don't even know.	tsy fantatro akory
Such a special place for me.	toy izany toerana manokana izany ho ahy
Because the truth is, he is right.	satria ny marina dia marina izy
I hope he still has it.	manantena aho fa mbola manana izany izy
The world watched it all.	nijery izany rehetra izany izao tontolo izao
Some are just stupid.	ny sasany dia adala fotsiny
He said he would come.	nilaza izy fa ho avy izy
He said it was good for you.	nilaza izy fa tsara ho anao izany
It’s really hard work.	tena asa mafy izany
But even then it’s still very fast.	saingy na izany aza dia mbola tena haingana
The place is too difficult.	sarotra loatra ilay toerana
He wanted to know.	tiany ho fantany
So we can do our best.	noho izany dia afaka manao izay tsara indrindra isika
It got a very good idea.	nahazo hevitra tsara be izy io
And you don’t have to start all over again.	ary tsy mila manomboka indray ianao
We can get it as follows.	afaka mahazo izany isika toy izao manaraka izao
It was fun no matter what.	nahafinaritra izany na inona na inona
He looks inside.	mijery ny ao anatiny izy
He himself said it for himself.	izy mihitsy no nilaza izany ho anny tenany
Maybe it’s something else.	angamba zavatra hafa izany
I think he should have told her first.	heveriko fa tokony ho nilaza taminy aloha izy
Probably not.	angamba tsy nisy
We watch from a distance.	mijery avy lavitra izahay
Or you, of course.	na ianao mazava ho azy
Because there was no high place there.	satria tsy nisy toerana ambony teo
That's not what matters.	tsy izany akory no zavadehibe
Didn’t do much.	tsy nanao zavatra betsaka
But you get there.	fa tonga any ianao
There were many other jobs as well.	nisy asa maro hafa koa
It has all these good things.	manana izany zavatra tsara rehetra izany
Two, together.	roa miaraka
I don't know him anymore.	tsy fantatro intsony izy
But you can.	saingy afaka izany ianao
They are not, however, complete.	tsy izy ireo anefa feno
You just go.	mandeha fotsiny ianao
So this is not uncommon.	ka tsy mahazatra izany
And he is with you.	ary miaraka aminao izy
Now they have it.	ankehitriny dia manana izany izy ireo
Maybe it’s perfect.	angamba izany tanteraka
They will both do it.	samy hanao izany izy
It's not too far here.	tsy dia lavitra loatra ny eto
He looked a lot bigger than before.	nijery betsaka kokoa noho ny teo aloha izy
Check out the location now.	jereo ny toerana izao
i love you love me.	tiako ianao tia ahy
You're very nice.	mahafinaritra tokoa ianao
Everything seems fine to me.	toa tsara amiko ny zavadrehetra
We also have.	izahay koa dia manana
You were the first to say that.	ianao no voalohany nilaza izany
The next step is no longer necessary.	tsy ilaina intsony ny dingana manaraka
You can’t go wrong with this one.	tsy afaka mandeha diso ianao aminity iray ity
He never said it would be easy.	tsy nilaza mihitsy izy hoe ho mora izany
Not sure if that makes sense ?.	tsy azo antoka raha misy dikany izany
Tonight was the best.	anio alina no tsara indrindra
But you have to work.	tsy maintsy miasa anefa ianao
We didn’t go far.	tsy lasa lavitra isika
But it really did exist.	saingy tena nisy tokoa izany
Just the first time.	vao vao voalohany
There is no place for them.	tsy misy toerana aminizy ireo
It still doesn't work.	mbola tsy miasa
But he never stopped.	tsy nijanona mihitsy anefa izy
But not in the same way.	saingy tsy aminny fomba mitovy
This is a very difficult task.	asa sarotra be ity
We can't be together anymore.	tsy afaka miaraka intsony isika
He was almost perfect.	saika mety izy
And a lot of people had the good ones.	ary maro ny olona nanana ny tsara
Good, good, best.	tsara tsara tsara indrindra
Maybe more than that.	mety mihoatra noho izany
But they are very true.	tena marina anefa izy ireo
See if you like.	jereo raha tianao
I knew it, because we did.	fantatro izany satria nanao izany izahay
The earth is far, far below us.	ny tany dia lavitra ambany lavitra antsika
Yes, none at the moment.	eny tsy misy aminizao fotoana izao
I was a nice person.	olona nahafinaritra aho
But everyone has a choice for everyone.	fa ny tsirairay dia manana safidy ho anny tsirairay
But it’s not really like that.	saingy tsy tena toy izany
But he saw me well.	nahita ahy tsara anefa
We have them.	manana azy ireo isika
He is still there today.	mbola ao izy anio
Yes, he did not.	eny tsy nanao izany izy
But it’s about something else as well.	fa momba zavatra hafa koa
Then came the best time for them.	dia tonga ny fotoana tsara indrindra ho azy ireo
Treat it as a meal.	ataovy toy ny sakafo
If you look, there is something better.	raha mijery ianao dia misy tsara kokoa
Went down to the ground.	nandeha ambany taminny tany
Once is enough.	indray mandeha dia ampy
They get nothing.	tsy mahazo na inona na inona izy ireo
It doesn’t exceed them either.	tsy mihoatra azy ireo koa izany
And he was already thinking of a story.	ary efa nieritreritra tantara iray izy
There’s still a lot of talk going on.	mbola betsaka ny resaka mandeha
It was a completely stupid idea.	efa hevitra adala tanteraka izany
And he still does.	ary mbola manao izany izy izao
He knew them all well, and he knew them well.	fantany tsara izy rehetra ary fantany tsara izy
He was happy there.	faly izy tao
You are completely wrong.	diso tanteraka ianao
But not often.	saingy tsy izany matetika
So that shouldn’t be possible.	noho izany dia tsy tokony ho azo atao izany
There have been trips.	efa nisy dia nandeha
Also, there was nothing real there.	ary koa tsy nisy na inona na inona marina tao
If he stopped, he would know.	raha nijanona izy dia ho fantany
Of course, it didn’t happen.	mazava ho azy fa tsy nisy izany
He will love them.	ho tia azy ireo izy
People really love them.	tena tia azy ireo ny olona
But it doesn’t work that way.	saingy tsy miasa toy izany izy
No history.	tsy misy tantara
It’s so much more.	mihoatra lavitra izany
People are not there yet.	tsy mbola eo ny olona
Whether you are real or not.	na ianao no tena izy na tsia
This place has it all.	ity toerana ity dia manana ny zavadrehetra
He is also one of the most controversial.	izy koa dia iray aminireo be ady hevitra indrindra
But there are still.	mbola misy ihany anefa
The place was great.	nahafinaritra ilay toerana
The facts said a lot of money.	ny zavamisy dia nilaza vola be
If you don’t know them, you really should know.	raha tsy fantatrao izy ireo dia tena tokony ho fantatrao
He doesn’t deserve it, no one does.	tsy mendrika izany izy tsy misy manao izany
Three years ago and now.	telo taona lasa izay ary ankehitriny
Three also said so.	telo koa no nilaza izany
So that’s the most important thing.	noho izany dia zavadehibe indrindra izany
Just like life.	toy ny fiainana ihany
He almost stopped.	saika nijanona izy
I can't be like this again.	tsy afaka ny ho toy izao indray aho
Smaller things become harder.	ny zavatra kely kokoa dia lasa sarotra
It's all true.	marina daholo
He will be very good.	ho tsara be izy
Day and night.	andro sy alina
Of course a little.	mazava ho azy fa kely
As a result of .	noho ny
These people are easy to spot.	mora hita ireo olona ireo
I used to absolutely love it.	tena tiako tanteraka izy io taloha
This, of course, is for me.	ity mazava ho azy dia ho ahy
He knew he had to do it.	fantany fa tsy maintsy hanao izany izy
Now everyone is here.	ankehitriny dia eto ny rehetra
Such a thing is lost for a reason.	very antony ny zavatra toy izany
But those needed.	fa ireo ilaina
At the moment it is.	aminizao fotoana izao dia ny
However, we have now.	na izany aza manana isika ankehitriny
We are as follows.	toy izao manaraka izao isika
Of course, he will be coming soon.	mazava ho azy fa ho avy tsy ho ela izy
It’s also wrong.	tsy mety koa izany
In fact, there may be more options.	raha ny marina mety misy safidy bebe kokoa
Everything is very simple.	ny zavadrehetra dia tena tsotra
No one sees us here.	tsy misy mahita anay eto
There is no other option for that.	tsy misy safidy hafa aminizany
I have a problem with that.	manana olana aho aminizany
Things work and work fast.	ny zavatra miasa sy miasa haingana
I could have had.	afaka nanana
But here you have to be.	fa eto ianao dia tsy maintsy ho
These are faster.	haingana kokoa ireo
They are very free.	tena afaka izy ireo
Both methods have problems.	samy manana olana ireo fomba roa ireo
This is not a pretty picture.	tsy sary tsara tarehy ity
He loves the game.	tiany ny lalao
I didn’t think well.	tsy nieritreritra tsara aho
So, there may be a problem.	noho izany mety hisy olana
Or, perhaps, because of him.	na angamba noho izany izy
This is his favorite food.	izany no sakafo tiany indrindra
I think he has to.	heveriko fa tsy maintsy izy
The man has.	ny lehilahy manana
This is a good house.	trano tsara ity
Not too hard, even close.	tsy dia mafy loatra na akaiky aza
The surroundings are really nice.	tena mahafinaritra ny manodidina rehetra
The truth is they both did little.	ny marina dia nanao kely izy roa
Anyway, it works for me.	na izany na tsy izany miasa ho ahy
I did the same in general.	nanao izany koa aho taminny ankapobeny
It’s all well and good.	tsara sy tsara daholo izany
It's not right there.	tsy mety fa eo
I really like doing that.	tena tiako ny manao izany
People always follow what they want.	manaraka izay tiany foana ny olona
Everyone had the same story.	samy nanana tantara mitovy aminizany ny rehetra
Yes, there is news.	eny misy vaovao
It might be simple.	tsotra angamba ilay izy
Then came the assurance.	dia tonga ny antoka
I know the good and the bad.	fantatro ny tsara sy ny ratsy
Or, perhaps, just a little.	na angamba mety kely fotsiny
If he’s not happy, so is he.	raha tsy faly izy dia toy izany koa izy
However, you don’t have to do all the work.	na izany aza tsy mila manao ny asa rehetra ianao
About the nonsense.	momba ny zavatra tsy misy dikany
He would still be there if it weren’t for him.	mbola ho eo ihany izy raha tsy noho izy
However, it is different.	na izany aza dia hafa ihany izany
Like, really great.	toy ny tena lehibe
Sometimes you do and sometimes you don’t.	indraindray ianao manao ary indraindray tsy manao
They seem to really love him.	toa tena tia azy izy ireo
And if not, you should.	ary raha tsy izany dia tokony
The facts are crazy.	adala ny zavamisy
The little ones don’t go far anymore.	tsy mandeha lavitra intsony ny kely
They are also very true.	tena marina koa izy ireo
However, some steps may not be available.	na izany aza mety tsy hisy ny dingana sasany
Otherwise, it won’t make sense.	raha tsy izany dia tsy hisy dikany izany
i am the same age as you	mitovy taona aminao aho
It seems almost too good if it’s not true.	toa saika tsara loatra raha tsy marina izany
But that was not true.	tsy nisy marina anefa izany
You were there and then you weren’t.	teo ianao ary avy eo tsy
It was very easy at first.	mora tokoa izany taminny voalohany
You will be the same.	ho toy izany ihany ianao
These are where we are.	ireo no misy anay
You start again and it becomes what you want.	manomboka indray ianao ary lasa izay tianao
He said he was not alone.	nilaza izy fa tsy izy irery
I hope this is good.	manantena aho fa tsara izany
Now they had to stop.	tsy maintsy nijanona izy ireo izao
Lots of photos of a good trip, gone.	sary maro momba ny dia tsara lasa
No one wants to lose a home.	tsy misy te ho very trano
You really don’t.	tena tsy manao izany ianao
But that is the choice.	fa izay no safidy
But that's the idea.	fa izay no hevitra
This fact makes sense.	misy dikany izany zavamisy izany
Here is why.	izao no antony
I actually prefer a house like that.	tiako kokoa ny trano toy izany raha ny marina
They just work, or don’t work.	izy ireo ihany no miasa na tsy miasa
It’s usually not very fun when done right.	tsy dia mahafinaritra loatra izany matetika rehefa atao tsara
Yes, everyone is wrong about this.	eny diso ny rehetra aminity
He said good, good.	hoy izy hoe tsara tsara
He does it for all of us.	manao izany ho antsika rehetra izy
It’s fun, but it’s not right.	mahafinaritra izany saingy tsy mety izany
This should never have been done.	tsy tokony ho natao mihitsy izany
Now, watch the game.	ankehitriny jereo ny lalao
Something is sure to come.	misy zavatra azo antoka ho avy
And it all starts here !.	ary manomboka eto daholo izany
One always goes when the other doesn’t.	mandeha foana ny iray raha tsy mandeha ny iray
You always have problems.	manana olana foana ianao
People expect that.	manantena izany ny olona
This is by no means the next step.	tsy izany mihitsy no dingana manaraka
Things may be different.	mety ho samy hafa ny zavatra
Maybe he’s right, maybe not.	marina angamba izy angamba tsy
Very good for one too.	tena tsara ho anny iray ihany koa
Nothing else is really necessary.	tsy misy zavatra hafa tena ilaina
I don’t like that talk.	tsy tiako io resaka io
This is very important.	tena zavadehibe io
I can't find it below.	tsy hitako eto ambany
To be found.	ho hita
It's a pleasure to be here.	faly tokoa ny tonga eto
They are very different.	tena tsy mitovy izy ireo
He thought again.	nieritreritra indray izy
This may be just the first step.	mety ho dingana voalohany fotsiny izany
There he died.	teo no maty
Needless to say.	nila nilaza izany
Especially in the right world.	indrindra aminny tontolo mety
Because you know you do.	satria fantatrao fa manao izany ianao
He was all there.	teo daholo izy
There will be no reason for that either.	tsy hisy antony koa izany
It is also a large building.	trano lehibe koa izy io
In general, this is true.	aminny ankapobeny dia marina izany
This is not one.	tsy iray ity
I should have thought that too.	tokony ho nieritreritra izany koa aho
But this is more about possibility.	saingy ity dia bebe kokoa momba ny mety
There is nothing, but everything is there.	tsy misy na inona na inona fa ny zavadrehetra dia ao
Yes, you are on the ground.	eny eo aminny tany ianao
This man has never done anything right.	tsy nanao zavatra araka ny tokony ho izy mihitsy ity lehilahy ity
That will be the most important thing.	izany no ho zavadehibe indrindra
We are all a part.	ampahany iray isika rehetra
This is because they don’t need one.	izany dia satria tsy mila iray izy ireo
I would like a picture.	mila sary aho
You are more than worthy.	mihoatra noho ny mendrika ianao
It will be close to all of us.	ho akaiky antsika rehetra
We finally lost them.	tsy nanana azy ireo intsony izahay taminny farany
But not tonight.	tsy anio alina anefa
It seems like it’s normal here now.	toy ny mahazatra izany eto ankehitriny
We have just come to a stage.	vao tonga aminny dingana iray isika
I never wanted to be like that.	tsy te ho toy izany mihitsy aho
Part of it.	ampahany aminy
We will do them soon.	hanao azy ireo tsy ho ela isika
It’s not hard to see that.	tsy sarotra ny mahita izany
He always came at night.	tonga foana ny alina izy
But that is the reality.	saingy izany no zavamisy
It may be like that, but it’s not.	mety ho toy izany izy saingy tsy izany
But when you grow up, there is only one thing you can do.	saingy rehefa lehibe ianao dia iray ihany no azonao atao
It was never there.	tsy teo mihitsy izany
But no one was there.	tsy nisy olona teo anefa
There are two things clearly.	misy zavatra roa mazava tsara
And a house.	ary trano iray
Glad to have you.	faly manana anao
I love being alone.	tiako ny irery
Many others follow.	manaraka izany ny maro hafa
Three main steps are needed.	dingana telo lehibe no ilaina
So start simple.	koa manomboka tsotra
But these words are actually three different meanings.	fa ireo teny ireo raha ny marina dia hevitra telo samy hafa
It works for us.	miasa ho antsika izany
But they are wrong.	fa diso izy ireo
However, it turned out to be good.	na izany aza dia hita fa tsara
And that's right.	ary marina ny aminizany
But it’s still fun.	fa mbola mahafinaritra
He soon found them.	tsy ela dia nahita azy ireo izy
That’s a lot.	efa betsaka izany
It was as it should be.	toy ny tokony ho izy izany
He is the same age as you.	mitovy taona aminao izy
One day he just died.	indray andro dia maty fotsiny
There was food everywhere.	nisy sakafo teny rehetra teny
A little bit, now.	kely kely izao
I looked at them.	nijery azy ireo aho
They’re tough, which is good.	mafy izy ireo izay tsara
In fact, it didn’t make sense.	raha ny zavamisy dia tsy nisy dikany izany
There must have been something really fun.	tsy maintsy nisy zavatra tena nahafinaritra
Life is too good.	tsara loatra ny fiainana
They are as real today as they were then.	tena marina izy ireo ankehitriny toy ny taminizany
The news has just arrived.	vao tonga ny vaovao
Both get a place.	samy mahazo toerana
When they work, they work well.	rehefa miasa izy ireo dia miasa tsara
I really like him personally.	tena tiako izy manokana
The work is very hard.	tena mafy ny asa
There must be many.	tsy maintsy misy maro
Either way, all the choices are my own.	na izany na tsy izany ny safidy rehetra dia ahy manokana
You have come to this wonderful world.	tonga eto aminity tontolo mahafinaritra ity ianao
Because sometimes less is more.	satria indraindray ny kely dia be kokoa
And good.	ary tsara
That would not be a good thing.	tsy ho zavatra tsara izany
Sometimes you need to work on what you get.	indraindray ianao dia mila manao asa aminny zavatra azonao
But I don’t like that.	tsy tiako anefa izany
And you don’t have to do anything.	ary tsy mila manao na inona na inona ianao
Very easy to get.	tena mora azo
It won’t be hard once.	tsy ho sarotra izany indray mandeha
I know it’s perfect.	fantatro fa tanteraka izany
I’ve always enjoyed it about him.	nahafinaritra ahy foana izany momba azy
This is the first job.	izany no asa voalohany
I like these people more.	tiako kokoa ireo olona ireo
But it won’t make sense.	saingy tsy hisy dikany izany
We can go beyond that, too.	afaka mihoatra izany koa isika
There is absolutely nothing in them.	tsy misy na inona na inona mihitsy ao aminizy ireo
Not as usual now.	tsy toy ny mahazatra ankehitriny
Which kind of fits, maybe not a big deal.	izay karazana mety mety tsy olana lehibe
Yes, that's enough.	eny ampy izany
Now you are needed.	aminizao fotoana izao dia ilaina ianao
And that is certainly not the end.	ary azo antoka fa tsy izany no farany
Both wrong and wrong.	samy tsy mety na diso
But that doesn't seem to be working.	toa tsy mandeha anefa izany
I'm not ugly.	tsy ratsy tarehy aho
We needed to start anew.	nila nanomboka vaovao izahay
Almost too easy.	saika mora loatra
Now he expects something special.	ankehitriny dia manantena zavatra manokana izy
I am not at all.	tsy izany mihitsy aho
I had a question.	nanana fanontaniana aho
But it seems too difficult.	toa sarotra loatra anefa izany
It is very important to be the same.	tena zavadehibe ny hoe mitovy
I can never thank you.	tsy afaka misaotra anao mihitsy aho
But that's easy.	fa izay no mora
The reality is what it is.	ny zavamisy dia izay misy ho azy
But we cannot do that.	tsy afaka manao izany anefa isika
That could be two issues.	mety ho olana roa izany
They both have one.	samy manana ny iray
Surely you have said something about it by now.	azo antoka fa efa nilaza zavatra momba izany ianao izao
But it’s not for everyone.	saingy tsy natao ho anny rehetra izany
No, much more than that.	tsia mihoatra lavitra noho izany
You don’t have to do this job.	tsy mila manao anio asa io ianao
I had no problem with that.	tsy nanana olana aho taminizany
I walk and walk.	mandeha sy mandeha aho
They were so happy to see me.	faly be izy ireo nahita ahy
Something was missing in him.	nisy zavatra very tao aminy
I really like this place.	tena tiako ity toerana ity
What a car.	inona no fiara
I don't need yours.	tsy mila ny anao aho
But he was not completely wrong.	tsy diso tanteraka anefa izy
That’s the best part of it.	izany no ampahany tsara indrindra aminizany
But you need to keep a close eye.	mila mijery tsara foana anefa ianao
There are still problems.	mbola misy olana ihany
You get me.	azonao aho
They are already here, he thought.	efa eto izy ireo hoy izy nieritreritra
For now, we just need to do the work.	aminizao fotoana izao mila manao ny asa fotsiny isika
And he was fast.	ary haingana izy
So he couldn't find anything.	ka tsy nahita na inona na inona intsony izy
The first, however.	ny voalohany na izany aza
We are farther away.	lavitra kokoa isika
Beautiful women there.	vehivavy tsara tarehy any
But it’s very real.	fa tena tena izy
I think it’s a man.	heveriko fa lehilahy izany
In fact, he didn’t know the pictures.	raha ny marina tsy fantany ireo sary
However, time will still not matter.	na izany aza mbola tsy hisy dikany ny fotoana
He goes as fast as he can.	mandeha haingana araka izay azo atao izy
He really likes her, you know.	tena tiany izy fantatrao
It could have become too pretty.	mety ho lasa tsara tarehy loatra
There is even money to be made here.	misy aza ny vola azo eto
No one else did.	tsy nisy nanao izany koa ny hafa
Of course, this is necessary.	mazava ho azy fa ilaina izany
It is true and complete.	marina sy feno izy io
Not this guy.	tsy ity lehilahy ity
And he knew it.	ary fantany izany
Very far.	lavitra be
One does not follow the other.	tsy manaraka ny iray ny iray
He also stopped.	nijanona koa izy
You were busy at the time.	be atao ianao taminizany fotoana izany
He did it unseen.	nanao izany tsy hita izy
We started from the beginning.	nanomboka taminny voalohany izahay
One should always be small, and the other large.	ny iray dia tokony ho kely foana ary ny iray lehibe
It’s not personal and it really shouldn’t be.	tsy ho anny tena manokana izany ary tena tsy tokony ho izy
They almost lost their homes.	saika very trano izy ireo
Going without it.	mandeha tsy misy azy
I shouldn’t be here, not sure.	tsy tokony ho eto aho tsy azo antoka
Probably too good.	mety tsara loatra
We were free then, as we are now.	afaka izahay taminizany toa azy ankehitriny
You told me that too.	nilaza izany tamiko koa ianao
It starts with the most fun.	manomboka ny tena mahafinaritra
I know them, almost all of them.	fantatro izy ireo saika izy rehetra
So they may be more accurate.	noho izany dia mety ho marina kokoa izy ireo
They have already done so.	efa nanao izany izy ireo
It could be just you.	mety ho ianao ihany
Or not immediately, however.	na tsy avy hatrany na izany aza
It doesn’t take much time.	tsy mila fotoana be izany
To me, that is important.	amiko dia zavadehibe izany
Yes, for sure.	eny azo antoka
He said he loved me.	nilaza izy fa tia ahy
In fact, he is more than that.	raha ny marina dia mihoatra izany izy
But I love both.	samy tiako anefa
I don't care.	tsy misy dikany aho
They now have two.	manana roa izy ireo ankehitriny
It's hard to see him.	sarotra ny mahita azy
You know you like it.	fantatrao fa tianao izany
Maybe he is, a little.	angamba izy kely
Because he had money.	satria nanana vola izy
Of course, a man can have a woman he likes.	mazava ho azy fa afaka manana vehivavy tiany ny lehilahy
This is going.	mandeha ity
I'm looking at what can be done.	mijery izay azo atao aho
The place is really nice.	tena mahafinaritra ny toerana
Always in the right place.	aminny toerana mety foana
See all ideas.	jereo ny hevitra rehetra
But here’s the thing.	fa izao no zavatra
It should be for you too.	tokony ho anao koa izany
There are no trivial facts.	tsy misy zavamisy tsy misy dikany
In general, he is not very good.	aminny ankapobeny tsy dia tsara loatra izy
Life is Beautiful.	mahafinaritra ny fiainana
The worst is yet to come.	mbola ho avy ny ratsy indrindra
But there is one thing you need to know.	saingy misy zavatra iray tokony ho fantatrao
He is close now.	akaiky izy izao
But they are more than that.	saingy mihoatra noho izany izy ireo
Another idea came to me.	nisy hevitra hafa tonga tamiko
Yes, it may be just a little bit.	eny mety ho kely fotsiny
Not pretty but it works.	tsy tsara tarehy fa miasa
And yours.	ary ny anao
Thanks for a wonderful night !.	misaotra taminny alina mahafinaritra
He’s great at those too.	izy dia lehibe aminireo ihany koa
And it really comes down to options.	ary tena tonga aminny safidy
Common method.	fomba mahazatra
He will come no matter what.	ho avy izy na inona na inona
One has to make a choice.	tsy maintsy manao safidy ny iray
I got a lot.	nahazo betsaka aho
Even though he loved her, he couldn’t have her.	na dia tiany aza izy dia tsy afaka nanana azy izy
Do what you can.	ataovy izay azonao atao
Make them your own.	ataovy ao aminny anao manokana izy ireo
Especially the big ones.	indrindra fa ny lehibe
It’s nothing to me.	tsy inona izany amiko
I find it difficult.	hitako fa sarotra izany
But it really looks like him.	saingy toa azy tokoa izany
And something was still missing.	ary mbola nisy zavatra tsy ampy
I think we are still at the bottom.	heveriko fa mbola any aminny farany ambany isika
This is not an easy task.	tsy asa tsotra izany
But he was gone, long dead.	efa lasa anefa izy efa maty ela
He didn't say that, he didn't do anything else.	tsy nilaza izany izy tsy nanao zavatra hafa
We did the same in the war.	nanao toy izany koa izahay taminny ady
No matter when you’re here.	na inona na inona rehefa eto ianao
At first he saw nothing.	taminny voalohany dia tsy nahita na inona na inona izy
Not even wrong.	tsy diso akory
That’s my favorite part.	izay no ampahany tiako indrindra
But when it works, it works.	fa rehefa miasa dia miasa
And they did nothing.	ary tsy nanao na inona na inona izy ireo
Life should not be like that.	tsy tokony ho toy izany ny fiainana
It was fun, just like you.	nahafinaritra izany toa anao
Some may be better, and some may be worse.	mety ho tsara kokoa ny ampahany ary mety ho ratsy kokoa ny ampahany
I can't either.	tsy afaka koa aho
And gone far.	ary lasa lavitra
One more thing.	zavatra iray hafa
So we can no longer get them.	noho izany dia tsy afaka mahazo azy ireo intsony izahay
You can really have it all.	afaka manana izany rehetra izany tokoa ianao
But what is good.	fa inona no tsara
Keep everything simple and clear.	ataovy tsotra sy mazava tsara ny zavadrehetra
And it will be closest to us.	ary ho akaiky antsika indrindra
Yes, it's just like you.	eny toa anao ihany izany
Not enough space.	tsy ampy toerana
You have to look to the future.	tsy maintsy mijery ny ho avy ianao
We have a lot of it.	manana maro be izahay
But she loves men.	fa tia lehilahy izy
They will know you are there.	ho fantany fa eo ianao
The world too.	izao tontolo izao koa
I have a question for you.	manana fanontaniana iray ho anao aho
This sometimes works better than other times.	izany indraindray dia miasa tsara kokoa noho ny aminny fotoana hafa
But we are not all that bad.	tsy ratsy toy izany rehetra izany anefa izahay
This has never been done before.	tsy mbola natao izany teo aloha
For the wrong reasons.	noho ny antony tsy mety
They and we.	izy ireo sy isika
He is also crazy.	adala koa izy
It doesn’t take long to see that.	tsy ela vao mahita izany
I love this car.	tiako ity fiara ity
We will get to that.	ho tonga aminizany isika
I could see him clearly.	hitako mazava tsara izy

But the situation is different.	hafa mihitsy anefa ny zavamisy
And this is the crazy, working part.	ary ity no ampahany adala miasa
He didn’t just stop there.	tsy nijanona teo fotsiny izy

Travel is common now.	efa mahazatra ny dia aminizao fotoana izao

He saw me too.	nahita ahy koa izy
Like, really bad, so this is hard.	toy ny tena ratsy ka ity dia sarotra
He said he did or stopped.	nilaza izy fa nanao na nijanona
But that is not an option.	tsy safidy anefa izany
It will be no different.	tsy hisy hafa izany
We are a very selfish kind.	karazana tia tena tokoa isika

They said he was a good man.	nilaza izy ireo fa lehilahy tsara izy
But the time has not come.	tsy tonga anefa ny fotoana
Not one or two either.	tsy iray na roa ihany koa
In fact, do it now.	raha ny marina ataovy izao
It went well.	dia nandeha tsara
You told me.	nilaza tamiko ianao
It seems like something that can be done.	toa zavatra azo natao izany
It’s fun again.	dia mahafinaritra indray

It never came.	tsy tonga mihitsy izany
I have a reason.	manana antony aho
It's a house.	trano io
The same words, which are real.	ireo teny ireo ihany izay tena izy
They are just houses.	trano fotsiny izy ireo
I think the word stupid is wrong.	heveriko fa diso ny teny hoe adala
But, this problem is much bigger than that.	saingy ity olana ity dia lehibe lavitra noho izany
Looks like there should be more.	toa mbola tokony hisy bebe kokoa
No one has ever looked at me like that.	tsy mbola nisy nijery ahy toy izany
But they are the best for us.	fa izy ireo no tena tsara indrindra ho antsika
But there may be something they don’t know.	mety misy zavatra tsy fantany anefa
So these are.	ka ireo dia
However, there is something to it.	na izany aza misy zavatra iray aminizany
There was a problem with the words.	nisy olana taminny teny
You need to go now.	mila mandeha ianao izao
She’s beautiful, yes.	tsara tarehy izy eny
In fact, he didn’t need it.	raha ny marina tsy nila azy izy
So the question is meaningless.	ka tsy misy dikany ilay fanontaniana
We never went there.	tsy nandeha tany mihitsy izahay
Very happy.	tena faly
The woman did not look at me.	tsy nijery ahy ilay vehivavy
They are available from everything.	izy ireo dia azo avy aminny zavatra rehetra
Probably not too far away.	mety tsy dia lavitra loatra
Here, of course.	eto mazava ho azy
This is usually a good thing.	matetika dia zavatra tsara izany
It’s all about him.	sarotra daholo ny momba azy
Still, it’s a beautiful place.	na izany aza dia toerana tsara tarehy
When they were gone, they were gone.	rehefa lasa izy ireo dia lasa
This is true because you and the universe are one.	marina izany satria iray ihany ianao sy izao rehetra izao
He had never existed before.	tsy mbola nisy izy taloha
And nothing will come.	ary tsy hisy ho avy
It’s all gone, it’s no longer possible.	lasa daholo tsy azo atao intsony
But he did not love her.	tsy tia azy anefa izy
And not without you.	ary tsy raha tsy misy anao
A little something like that is enough.	ny zavatra kely toy izany dia ampy
It’s still not the same.	tsy mbola izany ihany koa
He knows exactly where he is.	fantany tsara ny toerana misy azy
There will be some.	hisy ny sasany
In fact, he did more than that.	raha ny marina dia nanao mihoatra noho izany izy
The beautiful place.	ilay toerana mahafinaritra
You will go crazy when you see me.	ho lasa adala ianao rehefa mahita ahy
I said of course.	hoy aho mazava ho azy

It becomes impossible for everyone.	lasa tsy azo atao ho anny rehetra izy
In fact, they are worse.	raha ny marina dia ratsy kokoa izy ireo
Works very fast.	miasa haingana be
So when we started, we did it.	ka rehefa nanomboka izahay dia nanao izany
There are many important things you can do.	betsaka ny zavadehibe azonao atao
We will get there eventually.	ho tonga any isika aminny farany
It could be something.	mety ho zavatra izany
Just together.	miaraka fotsiny
It is not found.	tsy hita izany
Not enough money, however.	tsy ampy ny vola na izany aza
It’s not like you’re making money.	tsy toy ny hoe mahazo vola ianao
That should be the first story.	izay no tokony ho tantara voalohany
Good idea.	hevitra tsara
This is not really a fact.	tsy tena zavamisy marina izany
They can’t do both.	tsy afaka manao roa izy ireo
And they can do bad things too.	ary afaka manao zavatra ratsy koa izy ireo
Still, a fun story.	na izany aza tantara mahafinaritra
But he said he could.	nilaza anefa izy fa afaka
But that didn't seem to make sense.	toa tsy nisy dikany anefa izany
But that is not the only problem.	tsy izay ihany anefa no olana
And it did so to him.	ary nanao izany taminy izany
It was hard to get.	sarotra ny nahazo azy
He was there sometimes.	teo izy indraindray
In that way, he is also his.	aminizany fomba izany dia azy koa izy
It's easy to do.	mora ny manao izany
Only one died.	ny iray ihany no maty
But many people hope that this will happen.	betsaka anefa ny olona manantena fa hisy izany
I have news.	manana vaovao aho

We both have, he thought.	samy manana izahay hoy izy nieritreritra
He knew he had more life.	fantany fa manana fiainana bebe kokoa izy
Many of these.	maro aminireo

It never happened by itself.	tsy nandeha ho azy mihitsy izany
Yes, you can.	eny mety ianao
Work hard for him.	miasa mafy ho azy
No, there was no way.	tsia tsy nisy fomba
You know, you can go somewhere.	fantatrao afaka mandeha any aminny toerana iray ianao
There should be another year.	tokony hisy taona hafa indray
One works, one doesn’t.	ny iray miasa ny iray tsy miasa
But and often you know.	saingy ary matetika fantatrao
Of course, you can do whatever you want.	mazava ho azy fa afaka manao izay tianao ianao
This is the only time.	izao ihany no fotoana
And he is easily confused about some things.	ary mora very hevitra izy aminny zavatra sasany
But he saw nothing in it all.	saingy tsy nahita na inona na inona taminizany rehetra izany izy
And he knew it was wrong, too.	ary fantany fa diso koa izany
There was no reason for that.	tsy nisy antony izany
You can earn money in some places.	afaka mahazo vola any aminny toerana sasany ianao
It makes perfect sense.	misy dikany tanteraka
It must have been many years ago.	tsy maintsy efa taona maro lasa izay
There was also that.	nisy koa izany
Sometimes it’s good and other times it’s not.	indraindray dia tsara izany ary aminny fotoana hafa tsy
And you come.	ary tonga ianao
It was a very small thing.	tena zavatra kely ilay izy
It was there and gone.	teo ilay izy ary lasa
It had to be there.	tsy maintsy teo
They are not in their place.	tsy ao aminny toerana misy azy izy ireo
He went hard.	nandeha mafy izy
This is a very difficult time.	fotoana sarotra be izao
He is not yet grown up.	mbola tsy lehibe izy
That is the real problem here.	izay no tena olana eto
Well, he's already working on it.	eny tokoa efa miasa aminizany izy
It seemed like a really good time.	toa fotoana tena tsara tokoa ilay izy
They all now work faster and better.	izy rehetra izao dia miasa haingana sy tsara kokoa
I have yet to find a way.	tsy mbola nahita fomba aho
Make sure you do all three.	ataovy azo antoka fa hanao ny telo
It’s not about it.	tsy momba azy io
But it’s not stupid.	saingy tsy adala izany
But the process is not yet in the final stages.	tsy mbola eo aminny dingana farany anefa ny dingana
Those close to you.	izay akaiky anao
They are still too small.	mbola kely loatra izy ireo
He was completely and utterly wrong.	diso tanteraka sy tanteraka izy
Very nice, simple and beautiful.	tena tsara tsotra ary tsara tarehy
The latter was more fun.	ity farany dia nahafinaritra kokoa
Take a good look at us, he thought hard.	jereo tsara izahay hoy izy nieritreritra mafy
Eventually, he made a face.	rehefa ela ny ela dia nanao tarehy izy
It must be a lot of money.	tsy maintsy vola be izany
Or close to him.	na efa akaiky azy
In general they are the same.	aminny ankapobeny dia mitovy
There are three steps to the process.	misy dingana telo ny fomba
It's mine.	ahy io
The best kind of person.	ny karazana olona tsara indrindra
This is also not possible.	tsy azo atao koa izany
He needed to be alone.	nila irery izy
There is no place for me.	tsy misy toerana ho ahy
It's easy.	mora ihany ilay izy
Many of today’s nonsense will grow up one day.	maro aminireo tsy misy dikany ankehitriny no ho lehibe indray andro any
This house is for you.	ity trano ity dia ho anao
He is still a minor.	mbola tsy ampy taona izy

And men do it best in action.	ary ny lehilahy dia manao izany tsara indrindra aminny hetsika
Beautiful in a way.	tsara tarehy taminny fomba iray

Here men can do anything.	eto ny lehilahy dia afaka manao na inona na inona
It will be easier for them than for us.	ho mora kokoa ho azy ireo izany noho isika
I’m happy with the story again.	faly aho aminny tantara indray
Otherwise, we are not.	raha tsy izany dia tsy izahay
He used to be good and bad.	tsara sy ratsy izy taloha
It is a fact that they are here.	tena zavamisy fa eto izy ireo
So it doesn’t make sense to me.	ka tsy misy dikany amiko izany
But there aren’t many of them here.	saingy tsy misy maro aminizy ireo eto
If you don’t like it, that’s fine.	raha tsy tianao izany dia mety tsara
Yes, a world full of people will be a problem.	eny ho olana tokoa ny tontolo feno olona
These are the only questions.	ireo ihany no fanontaniana
It immediately seemed like a good idea.	avy hatrany dia toa hevitra tsara izany
You are very happy.	faly be ianao
He is crazy about this woman.	adala izy aminity vehivavy ity
And they all had to go.	ary tsy maintsy nandeha izy rehetra
This, of course, is the real bad story.	izany mazava ho azy no tena tantara ratsy
He is now going to the underworld.	mandeha any aminny tontolo ambany izy izao
And he had an idea.	ary nanana hevitra izy
With a potential death.	miaraka aminny maty mety
For them, it was different.	ho azy ireo dia hafa ihany izany
But that is not the point here.	tsy izany anefa no zavadehibe eto
One of them may follow.	ny iray aminizy ireo dia mety ho manaraka
So start there.	koa manomboka eo
Not that he will be free for long.	tsy hoe ho afaka ela izy
I could never do that.	tsy afaka nanao izany mihitsy
But of course this is a lost debate.	saingy mazava ho azy fa ady hevitra very izany
You don’t need money to get started.	tsy mila vola ianao vao manomboka
Some people just love it.	ny olona sasany dia tia azy fotsiny
Yes, it is very difficult.	eny tena sarotra izany
He does it to people.	manao izany aminny olona izy
Which is right for me, that is.	ny mety amiko izany hoe
And good early too.	ary tsara aloha koa
It will not be fun.	ho tsy mahafinaritra izany
But only one.	fa ny iray ihany
Or go fast.	na mandeha haingana
He is as good as ever.	tsara toy ny taloha izy
It’s no different.	tsy hafa mihitsy
Too many missing parts.	be loatra ny ampahany tsy hita
And one more little thing,.	ary zavatra kely iray hafa
You just have to look hard.	ianao ihany no tsy maintsy mijery mafy
Of course, there are problems.	mazava ho azy fa misy ny olana
If they are good, of course.	raha tsara izy ireo mazava ho azy
But it wasn’t too hard for me.	tsy dia mafy loatra amiko anefa izany

Not far.	tsy lavitra
He may have been thinking of something.	mety ho nieritreritra zavatra izy
And there will be no more.	ary tsy hisy intsony
We have to do them.	tsy maintsy manao azy ireo isika
They will all be gone.	tsy hisy intsony izy rehetra
I really hope this is true.	tena manantena aho fa marina izany
These are the only ones that are immediately available.	ireo ihany no azo avy hatrany
Ideas without words.	hevitra tsy misy teny
I really like it here.	tena tiako izany eto
Either way, there are others.	na izany na tsy izany mbola misy hafa
So it’s all stuff and nonsense, as usual.	noho izany dia zavatra sy tsy misy dikany daholo izany toy ny mahazatra
You know where they are.	fantatrao ny toerana misy azy ireo
It is yet to come and you will know the time.	mbola ho avy ary ho fantatrao ny fotoana
You need to start first.	mila manomboka aloha ianao
The thing is very clear.	mazava be ilay zavatra
But he won't do it tonight.	saingy tsy hanao izany izy anio alina
I exist and I do not exist.	misy aho ary tsy misy ahy
Because you’re fun.	satria mahafinaritra ianao
But he did.	nanao izany anefa izy
But it seemed like a wonderful day.	toa andro mahafinaritra anefa
We never saw it again in the end.	tsy nahita izany intsony izahay taminny farany
This is very general.	tena ankapobeny izany
He has to make a choice.	tsy maintsy manao safidy izy
I wouldn’t know.	tsy ho fantatro
But it’s well worth it.	saingy tena mendrika izany
No one has anything about him.	tsy misy manana na inona na inona momba azy
It’s all very good or good.	tena tsara na tsara daholo izany rehetra izany
I should be happy.	tokony ho faly aho
But it was important to me.	zavadehibe tamiko anefa izany
And it’s easy to see why.	ary mora ny mahita ny antony
He needed it and deserved it.	nila izany izy ary mendrika izany
Which is not an easy task.	izay tsy asa mora
But you do know something.	misy zavatra fantatrao anefa
He said he would not.	nilaza izy fa tsy hanao izany
This is the house for me.	ity no trano ho ahy
In the end, they had to do it for themselves.	taminny farany dia tsy maintsy nanao ho anny tenany izy ireo
And everyone just goes crazy.	ary lasa adala fotsiny ny rehetra
From this you get a lot of ideas.	avy aminizany dia mahazo hevitra maro ianao
Very good question indeed.	fanontaniana tena tsara tokoa
He will love you.	ho tia anao izy
The word has not yet come.	mbola tsy tonga ny teny
He needed it.	nila izany izy
Not because he wanted to be close to her.	tsy noho izy te ho akaiky azy
Yes, you are not alone.	eny tsy ianao irery
He didn't even look at it.	tsy nijery izany akory izy
They don’t seem happy.	toa tsy faly izy ireo
But it was fun.	tena nahafinaritra anefa ilay izy
Not too much to go on.	tsy dia be loatra ny mandeha
Yes, it's mine.	eny ahy io
There are two ways of doing this.	misy fomba roa momba izany
And even now, he didn’t.	ary na dia izao aza dia tsy nanao izany izy
It also didn’t make sense.	tsy nisy dikany koa izany
This world is wonderful.	mahafinaritra ity tontolo ity
And of course, nothing came of it.	ary mazava ho azy fa tsy nisy na inona na inona tonga taminizany
If not more.	raha tsy mihoatra
He doesn’t want them to be here.	tsy tiany ho eto izy ireo
Pictures will be coming soon.	ho avy tsy ho ela ny sary
You are so glad you did.	tena faly ianao fa nanao izany
They said it was wrong.	nilaza izy ireo fa tsy mety izany
It should be a game.	tokony ho lalao iray
At first glance, we seem to be there.	raha ny aminny voalohany dia toa efa ho eo isika
These will do perfectly.	ireo dia hanao tanteraka
Good choice.	safidy tsara
Don’t make sense.	aza misy dikany
But there is more.	mbola misy koa anefa
For me, though.	ho ahy na izany aza
Simple is better than difficult.	ny tsotra dia tsara noho ny sarotra
Of course you can, he said.	mazava ho azy fa afaka hoy izy
But that is not the point here.	tsy izay anefa no zavadehibe eto
Because they are safe.	satria azo antoka izy ireo
You need to look at it carefully.	mila mijery azy tsara ianao
Stupid ideas, none of them.	ny hevitra adala tsy misy ao aminy
As all good stories should be.	araka ny tokony ho tantara tsara rehetra
We will be here for you.	ho eto ho anao izahay
He had just come to the end.	vao tonga teo aminny farany izy
He had had enough.	efa ampy izy
And it's not like that.	ary tsy mba toy izany
And that goes with everything.	ary izany dia mandeha aminny zavadrehetra
It’s all fun and it’s worth it.	mahafinaritra daholo ary mendrika izany
This is very familiar to you.	tena mahazatra anao izany
I don't think you will.	heveriko fa tsy hanao izany ianao
I can walk around it now.	afaka mandeha manodidina azy aho izao
He didn’t do anything he didn’t like.	tsy nanao na inona na inona tsy tiany
Here comes the hard part.	tonga eto ny ampahany sarotra
Looked at him.	nijery azy
This is not an impossible method.	tsy fomba azo atao izany
I think it was the same then.	heveriko fa mitovy ihany koa izany taminizany
But not these.	fa tsy ireo
Sometimes you’re the only one who can’t.	ianao ihany indraindray no tsy afaka
Nothing good either.	tsy nisy tsara koa
I know it still exists.	fantatro fa mbola misy izy io
There is nothing wrong with them.	tsy misy ratsy aminizy ireo
Everyone has a problem.	samy manana olana ny tsirairay
He said that's not the main reason.	nilaza izy fa tsy izany no antony lehibe
He really liked the place.	tena tiany ilay toerana
We were there.	teo izahay
And that's the idea.	ary izany no hevitra
It’s perfect for a meal or two.	mety tsara ho anny sakafo iray na roa izany
They may die.	mety maty izy ireo
Some are lost.	very ny sasany
It’s not that nothing seems normal.	tsy hoe tsy misy zavatra toa mahazatra
It was always the same.	foana koa ilay izy
You are already here.	efa eto ianao
But not the little ones work.	fa tsy ny kely dia miasa
They should be the same.	tokony ho toy izany koa izy ireo
He can walk a little.	afaka mandeha kely izy
No one is happy about that.	tsy misy faly aminizany
Then he saw them.	dia nahita azy ireo
Look at this man.	jereo ity lehilahy ity
Because you will.	satria hanao izany ianao
And he seems to have done so.	ary toa nanao izany izy
Only one action.	iray ihany ny hetsika
Then see if possible.	dia jereo raha mety
Good stuff, words.	zavatra tsara teny
I have to go with yes.	tsy maintsy mandeha aminny eny aho
The reality is this.	ny tena izy dia ity
However, this method can be problematic and easily mistaken.	na izany aza ity fomba ity dia mety ho olana sy mora diso
Which, in fact, seems to go the full way.	izay raha ny marina dia toa mandeha aminny fomba feno
It looks the same.	mijery toy izany koa
The house is now completely full.	efa feno tanteraka ny trano aminizao fotoana izao
He paused for a moment.	nijanona kely izy
Here is the idea.	toy izao ny hevitra
The question is not simple.	tsy tsotra ilay fanontaniana
So, these are the ways.	noho izany ireo no lalana
It's all gone.	lasa daholo izay
He seemed to need it.	toa nila izany izy
It’s more fun.	mahafinaritra kokoa izany
I saw this too.	hitako koa ity
We don’t need that, though.	tsy mila izany izahay na izany aza
Not so here, on this earth.	tsy toy izany eto aminity tany ity
But the nights are different.	fa samy hafa ny alina
He will be gone.	ho foana izy
Make sure you start with him.	ataovy azo antoka fa manomboka miaraka aminy ianao
The picture may be years old.	mety efa taona maro ilay sary
Other times we get it.	aminny fotoana hafa dia mahazo izany isika
It's not too big.	tsy dia lehibe loatra izany
I know you don’t like it.	fantatro fa tsy tianao izany
Absolutely not.	tena tsy mety mihitsy
You can’t love them.	tsy afaka tia azy ireo ianao
But keep it simple.	fa ataovy tsotra
And this is the last question.	ary izao no fanontaniana farany
I'll be back soon.	ho avy tsy ho ela aho
I had one recently.	nisy iray aho vao haingana
In fact, it did nothing.	raha ny marina dia tsy nanao na inona na inona izany
But many years ago now.	saingy taona maro lasa izay aminizao fotoana izao
As before.	toy ny taminny voalohany
Both will do the same.	samy hanao izany izy roa
Look to the past.	jereo ny lasa
They were not before.	tsy teo aloha izy ireo
This is a very simple matter.	resaka tsotra tokoa ity
Too many people got the choice.	be loatra ny olona nahazo ny safidy
It works well in a safe way.	izy io dia miasa tsara aminny fomba azo antoka
Only history matters.	ny tantara ihany no zavadehibe
Beautiful, too, some of them.	tsara tarehy ihany koa ny sasany aminizy ireo
The same goes for cars.	toy izany koa aminny fiara
So it becomes a necessity of life.	noho izany dia lasa zavatra ilaina aminny fiainana
In fact, over time, it is always there.	raha ny marina rehefa mandeha ny fotoana dia misy foana izany
There were difficult times, for sure.	nisy fotoana sarotra azo antoka
But he really knows.	fa tena fantany
Each house is larger than the next.	ny trano tsirairay dia lehibe noho ny manaraka
I think that’s hard.	heveriko fa sarotra izany
I think this one is great.	heveriko fa lehibe ity iray ity
So there’s a lot around it.	noho izany dia betsaka ny manodidina azy
But they are not there.	tsy any anefa izy ireo
It’s really big, which is good.	tena lehibe izy io izay tsara
That is the reality today.	izany no tena zavamisy ankehitriny
I get.	mahazo
I started with a question.	nanomboka taminny fanontaniana iray aho
Or maybe not the place.	na angamba tsy ilay toerana
It’s fun to do and different from the usual.	mahafinaritra ny manao sy tsy mitovy aminny zavatra mahazatra
But we need it.	mila izany anefa izahay
I'm happy, you know.	faly aho fantatrao
There are so many things they will never know.	be dia be ny zavatra tsy ho fantany mihitsy
He must have been on the news fast no matter what.	tsy maintsy ho taminny vaovao haingana izy na inona
He is simple.	izy tsotra
It was a good job.	asa mety tsara ilay izy
Maybe though.	mety na dia izany aza
But they are easy to have.	saingy mora ny manana azy ireo
They are very fond of money.	tena tia vola izy ireo
It is nothing, but everything.	tsy misy na inona na inona izy io fa ny zavadrehetra
I want to do it right.	te hanao izany tsara aho
You need to know these things.	tokony ho fantatrao ireo zavatra ireo
I know there was.	fantatro fa nisy
These people are insecure.	ireo olona ireo dia tsy azo antoka
These are better.	tsara kokoa ireo
The right one.	ilay marina
You said people came here.	nilaza ianao fa tonga eto ny olona
Many died.	be dia be no maty
It might work better.	mety miasa tsara kokoa izany
They both just looked at me.	samy nijery ahy fotsiny izy ireo
They told him they were there.	nilaza taminy izy ireo fa tao izy ireo
We really love you.	tena tia anao izahay
It is real and personal.	tena misy sy manokana izany
We couldn't stop.	tsy afaka nijanona izahay
They got some things.	nahazo zavatra sasany izy ireo
It is for us personally.	ho antsika manokana izany
It shouldn’t be.	tsy tokony ho
Nothing about it is possible.	tsy misy na inona na inona momba izany dia mety
Not everyone sees it.	tsy ny rehetra no mahita izany
At first, there wasn’t even one.	taminny voalohany tsy nisy na dia iray aza
Yes, it's good to go.	eny tsara ny mandeha
He works better than before.	miasa tsara kokoa noho ny teo aloha izy
But you don’t understand the facts.	tsy azonao anefa ny zavamisy
Now this word is near.	ankehitriny ity teny ity dia akaiky
All this, it makes no sense.	izany rehetra izany tsy misy dikany
See the ground as best you can.	jereo ny tany araka izay azonao atao
However, they both did things right.	na izany aza dia samy nanao zavatra araka ny tokony ho izy
Hope everything goes well.	manantena fa mandeha tsara ny zavadrehetra
And they both did.	ary nanao izany izy roa
It may also be wrong.	mety diso koa angamba
It’s completely different.	hafa tanteraka izany
We're not going to do anything tonight.	tsy hanao na inona na inona isika aminity alina ity
Because nothing is certain.	satria tsy misy azo antoka
Or very close.	na tena akaiky
It really doesn’t suit them but the two of them.	tena tsy mety aminizy ireo fa izy roa ihany
He went too far, too good for her.	lasa lavitra izy tsara loatra taminy
Biggest meal of the day.	sakafo lehibe indrindra aminny andro
I can see the world clearly.	hitako tsara izao tontolo izao
It’s always done too hard.	atao mafy loatra foana
Go straight away.	tonga dia mandeha
For men, this is good.	aminny lehilahy dia tsara izany
Or bad days.	na ny andro ratsy
You seem to have to make a difficult choice.	toa tsy maintsy hanao safidy sarotra ianao
I have never seen it.	tsy mbola nahita izany aho
Of course, there are some problems.	mazava ho azy fa misy olana sasany
It’s not too hard, but it’s very common.	tsy dia sarotra loatra izany fa tena mahazatra
Another one of a kind.	ny hafa iray aminny karazana
We were so happy to come.	faly tokoa izahay tonga
Two different problems together.	olana roa samy hafa miaraka

If only that were true.	raha mba marina izany
There is no one way.	tsy misy lalana iray
His location is clear.	mazava tsara ny toerana misy azy
But we don't need them here.	tsy mila azy ireo anefa isika eto
Money is good.	tsara ny vola
He knows neither night nor day.	tsy fantany na alina na andro
And he had never thought anything about it before.	ary tsy mbola nieritreritra na inona na inona momba izany izy taloha
You know what works for you.	fantatrao izay mety aminao
He seemed to have thought so.	toa efa nieritreritra izany izy
These are .	ireo dia
But more than you can get.	fa mihoatra noho ny azonao
They are good here.	tsara izy ireo eto
So, we didn’t see him.	noho izany tsy nahita azy izahay
Or two women, if so.	na vehivavy roa raha izany
But one thing is for sure.	saingy zavatra iray no azo antoka
And we can do all that.	ary afaka manao izany rehetra izany isika
There is only one thing when you want it.	zavatra iray ihany no misy rehefa tianao izany

Men really do.	tena manao izany ny lehilahy
This world needs you.	mila anao ity tontolo ity

However, those who know.	na izany aza ireo fantany
But he is not completely stupid.	tsy adala tanteraka anefa izy
There’s a really big one in there.	misy iray tena lehibe ao
But it is a clear choice.	safidy mazava tsara anefa izany
This is not the end.	tsy izany no farany
They are two different worlds.	tontolo roa samy hafa izy ireo
Yes, that is one.	eny izany no iray
At the time, it seemed more accurate than it wasn’t.	taminizany fotoana izany dia toa marina kokoa noho ny tsy izy
But it still doesn’t work.	saingy mbola tsy mandeha
They just didn’t go.	tsy nandeha fotsiny izy ireo
In fact, it wasn’t necessary.	raha ny marina tsy nila izany
It’s a simpler time.	fotoana tsotra kokoa izany
He had never seen so much.	mbola tsy nahita be toy izany izy
There will be two.	hisy roa
Too big for one.	lehibe loatra ho anny iray
And he never liked her.	ary tsy tiany mihitsy izy
I hope you do.	manantena aho fa manao izany ianao
They take action and make choices.	manao hetsika izy ireo ary manao safidy
I think you do it.	heveriko fa ianao no manao izany
It’s easy to get past it.	mora ny lasa azy
That day will come and it will come one day.	ho avy io andro io ary ho avy indray andro any
Not that he knew he was here, but it wasn’t like that.	tsy hoe fantany fa eto izy fa tsy toy izany
He does it.	izy no manao izany
Expect a closer match.	manantena lalao akaiky kokoa
They are full of questions.	feno fanontaniana izy ireo
Otherwise, it didn’t exist.	raha tsy izany dia tsy nisy izany
It's lost.	very izany
I want to be that good.	te ho tsara toy izany aho
That's crazy.	izay adala
I know there is.	fantatro fa misy
The first is usually not.	ny voalohany dia matetika tsy
It’s just not good.	tsy tsara fotsiny izany
But in the end.	farany anefa izany
He might be happy here.	mety ho faly eto izy
And if so, when they know.	ary raha izany rehefa fantany
I will never be like that.	tsy ho toy izany mihitsy aho
I needed someone.	nila olona aho
But only the way.	fa ny lalana ihany
But there was no time left.	tsy nisy fotoana intsony anefa
The important thing is that they have to be found.	ny zavadehibe dia tsy maintsy ho hita izy ireo
So they said we need to do it.	noho izany dia nilaza izy ireo fa mila manao izany izahay
Sometimes, as now, they are not.	indraindray toy ny ankehitriny dia tsy izy ireo
It was the same thing done.	izy io ihany no natao
The house is very nice and beautiful.	ny trano dia tena tsara tarehy sy tsara tarehy
It didn't work at first.	tsy nandeha izany taminny voalohany
It could be more than that.	mety ho mihoatra noho izany
And he had to do something about it.	ary tsy maintsy nanao zavatra momba izany izy
These stories are very much like life.	ireo tantara ireo dia tena toy ny fiainana
It’s in people.	ao aminny olona izany
He looked at the facts.	nijery ny zavamisy izy
I have never had this problem before.	mbola tsy nanana izany olana izany mihitsy aho
Overall, she is beautiful.	aminny ankapobeny tsara tarehy izy
He had news.	nanana vaovao izy
I know all about him.	fantatro daholo ny momba azy
And it almost works as it should.	ary saika miasa araka ny tokony ho izy
It’s all talk but no action.	resaka daholo izany fa tsy misy hetsika
But he came here first.	fa izy aloha no tonga eto
He is a very good man.	lehilahy tsara loatra izy
This is also very true.	tena marina koa izany
That’s a good thing too.	zavatra tsara koa izany
But now, here you are.	fa izao eto ianao

Then it came to him.	dia tonga taminy izany
But those days are long gone.	efa ela anefa izany andro izany
It doesn’t have its own.	tsy manana ny azy manokana

I saw the game.	hitako ilay lalao
What you don’t know.	izay tsy fantatrao
He may come to himself.	mety ho tonga aminny tenany izy

It is a process.	dingana iray io
He had a difficult life.	nanana fiainana sarotra izy
Or maybe age.	na mety taona
I'm right.	marina hoy aho
You know with.	fantatrao miaraka aminny
In the end, it became too much.	lasa be loatra ilay izy taminny farany
I was confused, there was no way out.	very hevitra aho tsy nisy lalana intsony
Although there are some.	na dia misy aza ny sasany
In fact, no, that's not true.	raha ny marina tsia tsy marina izany
And as usual.	ary toy ny mahazatra
But life is like that.	toy izany anefa ny fiainana
But it’s not always like that.	saingy tsy toy izany foana
Surely we all love good people.	azo antoka fa tia olona tsara isika rehetra
You will be glad you did.	ho faly ianao fa nanao izany
It was a bad job.	asa ratsy ilay izy
He knows them.	fantany izy ireo
This is done once.	izany dia atao indray mandeha
You used to be human.	olona ianao taloha
Not happy with those.	tsy faly aminireo
Or maybe he is.	na angamba izy
He did the impossible.	nanao ny tsy azo atao izy
But many people.	fa maro ny olona
But a lot of people don’t.	saingy maro ny olona tsy manao izany
He has something good.	manana zavatra tsara izy
That’s too good for me.	tsara loatra amiko izany
He was very safe there.	tena azo antoka izy teo
He has now become accustomed to it.	lasa mahazatra azy izao
I won’t waste time either.	tsy ho very fotoana koa aho
And it’s not true at all, when it comes to that.	ary tsy marina mihitsy raha tonga aminizany
I think this is the best.	heveriko fa ity no tsara indrindra
I love words more than anything.	tiako mihoatra noho ny zavatra rehetra ny teny
But something had to be done.	nisy zavatra tsy maintsy natao anefa
Choice is a question of method.	ny safidy dia fanontaniana momba ny fomba
I know the type.	fantatro ny karazana
It’s a really fun thing.	tena zavatra tena mahafinaritra
Not a problem for us.	tsy olana ho antsika
It can be ugly.	mety ho ratsy tarehy
But he didn't really like it.	tsy tena tiany anefa izany
And that’s crazy.	ary adala izany
Still the same idea.	mbola mitovy hevitra ihany
Put it all in him.	ataovy ao aminy daholo izany
But this is not always possible.	tsy azo atao foana anefa izany
They come more often.	tonga matetika kokoa izy ireo
It doesn’t seem real to me.	toa tsy tena izy amiko
He didn’t know why, but they were there.	tsy fantany ny antony fa tao izy ireo
Always do the beautiful.	manao foana ny tsara tarehy
They are all dead now.	efa maty daholo izao
Of course, that was hard to get.	mazava ho azy fa sarotra ny nahazo izany
But it’s too easy.	mora loatra anefa izany
I was not happy with either option.	tsy faly aho taminny safidy roa
There really seemed to be a game.	toa nisy tokoa ny lalao
Now we have a choice.	aminizao fotoana izao dia manana safidy isika
She is happy with it all.	faly aminizany rehetra izany izy
Then it came to me.	dia tonga amiko izany
Then he left.	dia lasa izy avy eo
But in the game, that doesn’t work.	saingy aminny lalao dia tsy mandeha izany
Everyone needs a personal life.	mila fiainana manokana ny tsirairay
Yes, not if you don’t like it.	eny tsy raha tsy tianao izany
But you get them.	fa azonao izy ireo
The meaning is still the same.	mbola mitovy ny dikany
There was nothing and nothing certain.	tsy nisy na inona na inona ary tsy nisy azo antoka
Or, more simply.	na tsotra kokoa
They are very happy to see us.	faly be izy ireo rehefa mahita antsika
Age is another matter.	resaka hafa ny taona
It’s really fun.	tena mahafinaritra ilay izy
This is underage.	tsy ampy taona ity
You looked at him.	nijery azy ianao
He is too selfish.	tia tena loatra izy
However, this did not happen.	hita anefa fa tsy tanteraka izany
There is no beautiful road.	tsy misy lalana tsara tarehy akory
But he said no.	tsia anefa hoy izy
Or almost anything.	na saika ny zavatra rehetra
They both really deserve it.	tena mendrika izany izy roa ireo
Such a result is very insignificant.	ny vokatra toy izany dia tena tsy misy dikany
From above he could see everything.	avy any ambony izy dia afaka nahita ny zavadrehetra
No, you have to go.	tsia tsy maintsy mandeha ianao
He is lost, he is certainly lost.	very izy azo antoka fa very
Not a house like that.	tsy trano toy izany
But here, you can.	saingy eto azonao atao
Good woman, you work well.	vehivavy tsara miasa tsara ianao
The process is the same.	toy izany koa ny dingana
I think he is a man.	heveriko fa olona izy
However, he is certainly not the only one.	na izany aza azo antoka fa tsy izy irery ihany
I hope yours too.	manantena aho fa ny anao koa
Sure enough.	azo antoka tsara
Maybe it’s just as good.	angamba tsara toy izany koa izany
Previously, there were men she didn’t know very well.	teo aloha dia nisy lehilahy tsy fantany loatra
Because I am really one.	satria tena iray ihany aho
The earth is a part of all life.	ny tany dia ampahany aminny fiainana rehetra
A difficult process.	dingana sarotra
But he kept thinking about her.	nieritreritra momba azy foana anefa izy
It won’t be too bad.	tsy ho ratsy loatra izany
This is a true story.	tantara marina ity
He was there, himself.	teo izy ny tenany
It just won’t come.	tsy ho avy fotsiny
No time is lost.	tsy misy fotoana very
I'm very much like you.	tena mitovy aminao aho
They don’t all work.	tsy miasa daholo izy ireo
But that is not the point.	tsy izany anefa no resaka
This is not the real debate.	tsy izany no tena ady hevitra
But everything else is probably a small thing.	fa ny zavatra hafa rehetra angamba dia zavatra kely
No one can do it for sure whether it is yes or no.	tsy misy afaka manao izany azo antoka fa eny na tsia
Just a little bit.	somary kely ihany
Not next year again.	tsy aminny taona ho avy indray
See that we love it personally.	jereo fa tia manokana izahay
This is very important to us.	tena lehibe ho anay izany
It is more than a house.	mihoatra noho ny trano izy io
It's the same tonight.	tsy misy hafa aminizao alina izao
They are generally small.	aminny ankapobeny dia kely izy ireo
Generally you don’t want to do that.	aminny ankapobeny dia tsy tianao ny hanao izany
Not the first, not the last.	tsy ny voalohany tsy ny farany
Soon the day will be clear.	tsy ho ela dia ho mazava ny andro
I would really like it otherwise.	tena tiako raha tsy izany
Yes, for them now.	eny ho azy ireo izao
Everything is different now, he said.	hafa ny zavadrehetra ankehitriny hoy izy
I really enjoyed it even then.	tena nahafinaritra ahy izany na dia taminizany fotoana izany aza
We can have both.	afaka manana ny roa isika
Every game here is tough.	sarotra ny lalao rehetra eto
And he seems to really like that place.	ary toa tena tiany io toerana io
In fact, it is very, very low.	raha ny marina dia tena ambany dia ambany
As before, he didn’t think about it all.	toy ny teo aloha tsy nieritreritra izany rehetra izany izy
It’s not that it’s too early right now.	tsy hoe misy aloha be loatra aminizao fotoana izao
The two men are not good.	tsy tsara ny lehilahy roa
I've been to one.	efa taminny iray aho
I'd like .	mila
But that is not all.	tsy izany ihany anefa
This one is top notch.	ity iray ity dia ambony indrindra
There is no other option.	tsy misy safidy hafa
And we still do.	ary mbola manao izany isika

That doesn't seem to be true anymore.	toa tsy marina intsony izany
But we have never said anything like that.	saingy tsy mbola nilaza zavatra toy izany izahay
They are always tough.	mafy foana izy ireo
Maybe it won’t even happen.	angamba tsy hisy akory izany
But if he did, he didn't say so.	fa raha nanao izany izy dia tsy nilaza izany
Then they never came again.	dia tsy tonga intsony izy ireo
I do just as usual.	manao toy ny mahazatra ihany aho
He has been there for a long time.	efa ela izy no teo
Both were unpleasant.	samy tsy nahafinaritra
She loves him, and he loves her too.	tia azy izy ary izy koa no tiany
There is no more time here.	tsy misy fotoana intsony eto
I had to do it now.	tsy maintsy nanao izany aho izao
What else do you get ?.	inona koa no azonao
I've seen enough.	efa ampy ny hitako
Look, he said.	jereo hoy izy
But we should act as we have.	fa tokony hanao toy ny manana isika
No.	no
But now it all made sense.	saingy izao dia nisy dikany daholo izany
These are meant for women.	natao ho anny vehivavy ireo
I love days like that.	tiako ny andro toy izany
But not all options are for everyone.	saingy tsy natao ho anny rehetra ny safidy rehetra
It always seems crazy to me.	toa adala foana izany amiko
Great time.	fotoana tena tsara
The latest.	ny farany indrindra
Everything seems normal at first.	toa mahazatra ny zavadrehetra aminny voalohany
Certainly not right.	azo antoka fa tsy mety izany
But that’s a nonsense idea.	saingy hevitra tsy misy dikany izany
And that's right for you.	ary izay no mety aminao
It is an impossible and meaningless task.	asa tsy azo atao sy tsy misy dikany izany
What is to come.	inona no ho avy
Such as .	toy ny
Of course, that time has not yet come.	mazava ho azy fa tsy mbola tonga izany fotoana izany
Such is the case with him.	toy izany ny momba azy
More than is possible.	mihoatra noho izay azo atao
I may have a problem.	mety manana olana aho
That is enough for many of them.	ampy izay ny maro aminizy ireo
Money is almost worthless.	saika tsy misy dikany ny vola
The same is true of men and women.	ary toy izany koa ny eo aminny lehilahy sy ny vehivavy
You just have to love him.	mila tia azy fotsiny ianao
As before, no.	toy ny teo aloha tsia
I just couldn’t stop.	tsy afaka nijanona fotsiny aho
You cannot do anything alone in this world.	tsy afaka manao na inona na inona irery ianao eto aminity tontolo ity
Everyone is confused.	very hevitra ny rehetra
Not good, not bad.	tsy tsara tsy ratsy
You can do good.	afaka manao ny tsara ianao
But, of course, not everything is good.	saingy mazava ho azy fa tsy tsara ny zavadrehetra
Especially now.	indrindra fa izao
It was nice to see him have that moment.	nahafinaritra ny nahita azy nanana izany fotoana izany
He knows where he is now.	fantany ny toerana misy azy izao
I was before.	teo aloha aho
There are many such people in the world.	be dia be ny olona toy izany eto aminizao tontolo izao
Then you are mine.	dia ahy ianao
The first step.	ny dingana voalohany
So, it’s really important.	noho izany tena zavadehibe izany
He can’t possibly have a bad idea.	tsy mety ho manana hevitra ratsy izy
They could be better.	mety ho tsara kokoa izy ireo
It just shouldn’t do anything.	tsy tokony hanao na inona na inona fotsiny izany
Not yet .	tsy mbola
In fact, you don’t need it.	raha ny marina tsy mila izany ianao
We are too hard.	mafy loatra isika
While the food was still there.	raha mbola teo ny sakafo
One three is three.	ny iray telo dia telo
It all seems like a long time ago.	izany rehetra izany dia toa efa ela be izao
They are gone now.	lasa izy ireo ankehitriny
Still need work in other words.	mbola mila asa aminny teny hafa
Very good.	tsara be
You can do it other ways as well.	afaka manao fomba hafa koa ianao
In fact, this is a war.	raha ny marina izany no ady
Here is the problem.	ity ny olana
He was wrong, of course.	diso izy mazava ho azy
But this one is a good fit.	fa ity iray ity dia mety tsara
I really have to go now.	tena tsy maintsy mandeha aho izao
After all, they aren’t.	rehefa ela ny ela dia tsy izy ireo
But one thing is certain.	zavatra iray anefa no azo antoka
A man is a man because he works.	ny lehilahy dia lehilahy satria miasa izy
It’s just part of the job.	ampahany aminny asa ihany izany
He seems to be everywhere now.	toa hita eny rehetra eny izy ankehitriny
It is not a picture at all.	tsy sary mihitsy ilay izy
It may be, but not always.	mety ho izany fa tsy foana
It always comes down to that.	tonga aminizany foana
But that is not the problem here.	tsy izay anefa no olana eto
Money is not a thing.	tsy zavatra ny vola
He knew them all well before.	fantany tsara daholo izy ireo taloha
Money is no longer an issue.	tsy olana intsony ny vola
He did not want to be alone anymore.	tsy te ho irery intsony izy
And that’s a big question.	ary fanontaniana lehibe izany
And they didn’t stop.	ary tsy nijanona izy ireo
So that makes no sense.	ka izany no tsy misy dikany
Now it will be better.	aminizao fotoana izao dia ho tsara kokoa
His neighbors did the same.	nanao izany koa ny manodidina azy
It went well, well.	nandeha tsara tsara
I have never seen him like this.	mbola tsy nahita azy toy izao aho
He can do the same.	afaka toy izany koa izy
We don’t seem to be alone.	toa tsy irery isika
It was really wrong to stay.	tena diso ny nijanona
So it really doesn’t work.	ka tena tsy mety miasa
Like it never existed, no matter what.	toy ny tsy nisy mihitsy na inona
Maybe it wasn’t, he thought.	angamba tsy nisy izany hoy izy nieritreritra
i don't always do.	tsy manao foana aho
No one does great things for themselves.	tsy misy olona manao zavatra lehibe ho azy irery
It’s a fun fun fun thing for me.	mahafinaritra mahafinaritra mahafinaritra ahy
There is a very good reason for that.	misy antony tena tsara aminizany
Just the two of us.	isika roa ihany
And he still went a long way.	ary mbola nandeha lavitra izy
But not fast.	saingy tsy haingana
Nothing else is wrong or meaningless.	tsy misy zavatra hafa tsy mety na tsy misy dikany
This little word.	ity teny kely ity
All of these are not true.	tsy marina daholo ireo
No, we can't have that.	tsia tsy afaka manana izany isika
Not me or any other woman.	tsy amiko na vehivavy hafa
Either way, it won’t make much sense.	na izany na tsy izany dia tsy hisy dikany loatra izany
And it’s a lot of work, too.	ary asa be koa izany
For sure.	ny azo antoka
That, he said, is a very good thing.	izany hoy izy dia zavatra tena tsara
A lot of action took place.	betsaka ny hetsika natao
This is a very different fact.	tena zavamisy hafa izany
It's not clear to me.	tsy mazava amiko izany
The first is timing.	ny voalohany dia ny fotoana
Not everyone is like that.	tsy ny rehetra ihany no toa azy
Generally no travel, no activity.	aminny ankapobeny dia tsy misy dia tsy misy hetsika
First, you don’t get a clear problem.	voalohany tsy mahazo olana mazava ianao
You can do anything for them if you want.	afaka manao ny zavadrehetra ho azy ireo ianao raha tianao
I really find the big part missing.	tena hitako tsy ampy ny ampahany lehibe
You know the house.	fantatrao ny trano
You are better than us.	tsara noho izahay ianao
This is probably the easiest thing you can do.	izany angamba no zavatra mora indrindra azonao atao
Everyone needs these people.	mila ireo olona ireo ny tsirairay
New game, perhaps.	lalao vaovao angamba
It already exists.	efa misy izany
They generally don’t.	aminny ankapobeny dia tsy manao izany izy ireo
It just doesn’t exist.	tsy misy izao fotsiny
It’s a dead thing.	zavatra maty izany
He was too fast for words.	haingana loatra taminny teny izy
I am a nice person.	olona mahafinaritra aho
Some it is you.	ny sasany dia ianao ity
Even now it is in the same place.	na dia aminizao fotoana izao dia teo aminny toerana iray ihany
But it stopped again.	nijanona indray anefa izany
There was one now and it was one then.	iray izao ary iray izany taminizany
But in reality, they have no end.	saingy raha ny marina dia tsy misy farany izy ireo
So that's where it is.	ka izay no misy azy
But it seems like another life.	toa anny fiainana hafa anefa izany
It is difficult, but impossible.	sarotra izany saingy tsy azo atao
So you get the best of both worlds.	noho izany dia mahazo ny tsara indrindra aminny tontolo roa ianao
Yes, this is it.	eny ity ihany
We go too fast.	mandeha haingana loatra isika
Just clear.	mazava fotsiny
Whatever, you are lost.	na inona na inona very ianao
You said .	hoy ianao
You didn’t see the last time.	tsy nahita fotoana farany ianao
And then he just stopped.	ary avy eo dia nijanona fotsiny izy
I don't know for sure.	tsy fantatro mazava
It seemed silly and unreal.	toa adala sy tsy tena izy ilay izy
But don't do that.	aza manao izany anefa
I think it’s really good.	heveriko fa tena tsara ilay izy
Do it today.	ataovy izany anio
He doesn’t know what his problem is.	tsy fantany ny olana mahazo azy
If he’s alone, that’s fine.	raha irery izy dia tsara izany
I kept looking at it.	nijery izany hatrany aho
It’s a first and foremost thing.	zavatra voalohany indrindra izany
We will do it there.	hanao izany izahay any
I stayed inside a lot.	nijanona tao anatiny be aho
They are not real.	tsy tena izy ireo
If only things were that simple.	raha mba tsotra toy izany ny zavatra
I'm not on time.	tsy tonga fotoana aho
Don’t look down on me.	aza mijery ambany aho
Maybe he won’t do it now.	angamba tsy hanao izany izy izao
This is the first step.	izany no dingana voalohany
Or as an adult.	na toy ny lehibe
He doesn't need to work anymore.	tsy mila miasa intsony izy
There was no house and I was not there.	tsy nisy trano ary tsy nisy ahy
He walks alone.	mandeha irery izy
And a really good thing too.	ary zavatra tena tsara koa
But his.	fa ny azy
Not a word was lost from him.	tsy nisy na dia teny iray aza very taminy
It shouldn’t even be an option.	tsy tokony ho safidy akory izany
No other words.	tsy misy teny hafa
If both do, we will do it.	raha manao izany ny roa dia hanao izany isika
I know people will do it.	fantatro fa hanao izany ny olona
We are everywhere.	eny rehetra eny isika
Yes, thank you for that.	eny misaotra anao noho izany
I know it’s hard here.	fantatro fa sarotra ny eto
He didn't even look at her.	tsy nijery azy akory izy
this is you.	ianao ity
We can do that now.	afaka manao izany isika izao
He seemed a very nice man.	toa lehilahy nahafinaritra tokoa izy
Have a quick first step.	manana dingana voalohany haingana
But we had others.	nisy hafa anefa izahay
He said he couldn't look at himself.	nilaza izy fa tsy afaka nijery ny tenany
Often, though, you need more.	matetika anefa mila bebe kokoa ianao
It was only true.	nisy marina ihany izany
There are other reasons as well.	misy antony hafa koa
Seems like a lot of work.	toa asa be
But it’s hard to be here.	sarotra anefa ny hoe eto
Only the other three.	ny hafa telo ihany
They are having a wonderful year.	manana taona mahafinaritra izy ireo
But he will be found there.	fa ho hita eo izy
But it is not like us.	tsy toa antsika anefa izany
They are misplaced.	diso toerana izy ireo
He really wanted to do something good.	tena te hanao zavatra tsara izy
They are no longer his.	tsy azy intsony izy ireo
There is a great world there.	misy tontolo lehibe any
So it can be done well.	noho izany dia azo atao tsara izany
But maybe they aren’t.	fa angamba tsy izy ireo
Anything is possible, today.	azo atao ny zavadrehetra anio
You have a good idea.	manana hevitra tsara ianao
I got the first two.	nahazo ny roa voalohany aho
One is.	ny iray dia
You are a product.	vokatra ianao
There was that word again.	nisy indray io teny io
But we died.	fa maty izahay
And one for me too.	ary iray ho ahy koa
But not anymore.	fa tsy izao intsony
Or not seen at all.	na tsy hita mihitsy
But never do.	fa tsy manao mihitsy
You are the reason.	ianao no antony
He still doesn't know the right word.	mbola tsy fantany ny teny mety
One thing is missing.	zavatra iray no tsy ampy
Something finally came.	nisy zavatra tonga taminny farany
They don’t make much sense.	tsy dia misy dikany loatra izy ireo
No not yet.	tsia tsy mbola
You, sometimes.	ianao indraindray
He finally found a house.	nahita trano ihany izy
Yes, it should be very simple.	eny tokony ho tsotra be izany
No one was coming.	tsy nisy olona ho avy
In fact, he is a trivial thing.	raha ny marina izy dia zavatra tsy misy dikany
Now it goes well.	ankehitriny dia mandeha tsara
Closer than you get.	akaiky kokoa tsy ho azonao
I always thought that.	nieritreritra izany foana aho
Things are as usual here.	toy ny mahazatra ny zavatra eto
In fact, no one saw it.	raha ny marina dia tsy nisy nahita izany
Not happy with.	tsy faly aminny
Very simple, very easy.	tena tsotra tena mora
But this does not go smoothly.	tsy mandeha tsotra anefa izany
It shouldn’t be seen.	tsy tokony ho hita izany
You haven’t started to have an idea.	tsy mbola nanomboka nanana hevitra ianao
They should be clearer and clearer.	tokony ho mazava kokoa sy mazava kokoa izy ireo
Not far from here but still very far.	tsy lavitra ny eto fa mbola lavitra be
The world made you like this.	izao tontolo izao no nanao anao toy izao
Apparently they saw him first.	toa izy ireo no nahita azy voalohany
Some people are like that.	tena toy izany ny olona sasany
But if you start, you have more time.	fa raha manomboka ianao dia manana fotoana bebe kokoa
Some are big and some are small.	misy lehibe ary misy kely
The same word.	ny teny mitovy
That is not a question.	tsy fanontaniana izany
I really have.	tena manana aho
Don’t do that person.	aza manao izany olona izany
Clearly they are.	mazava fa izy ireo
I have something.	manana zavatra aho
I know there is nothing in it.	fantatro fa tsy misy na inona na inona ao
We enjoyed it.	nahafinaritra anay izany
I got two in one day, first of all.	nahazo roa aho taminny andro iray voalohany indrindra
I did something like that once.	nanao zavatra toy izany aho indray mandeha
Even us.	isika aza
It’s more than worth it I said.	mihoatra noho ny mendrika izany hoy aho
Lots of good ones.	betsaka ny tsara
But you might not like it.	saingy mety tsy tianao izany
He just does it.	manao izany fotsiny izy
He loves it as it is.	tiany toy ny misy azy
But I will have to be lost.	tsy maintsy ho very anefa aho
The reason is clear.	mazava ny antony
Everything is different now.	hafa ny zavadrehetra ankehitriny
I want it to be harder than that.	tiako ny ho sarotra kokoa noho izany
You just have to go with it.	tsy maintsy mandeha miaraka aminy fotsiny ianao
For me, it was there.	ho ahy dia nisy izany
It’s a common practice now, of course.	fomba mahazatra mahazatra ankehitriny mazava ho azy
But doing so properly is not easy.	tsy mora anefa ny manao izany araka ny tokony ho izy
I had a simple choice.	nanana safidy tsotra aho
Maybe he has a reason.	misy antony angamba izy
I had never done that before.	tsy mba nanao izany mihitsy aho taloha
It’s not the same war.	tsy ady mitovy izany
Every woman loves.	ny vehivavy rehetra tia
You had a great time, man.	ianao no fotoana lehibe lehilahy
I may have been wrong about that.	mety ho diso hevitra aho taminizany
But this is no longer true here.	tsy marina intsony anefa izany eto
Then again, it could be wrong.	avy eo indray mety ho diso izany
The first is always the worst.	ny voalohany dia ny ratsy indrindra foana
Real process.	tena dingana
But that is not yet the case.	tsy mbola izany anefa no zavamisy
When they came, they said every word.	rehefa tonga izy ireo dia nilaza ny teny rehetra
It was a really bad day.	tena andro ratsy izany
Everyone can be happy.	mety ho faly ny rehetra
So it’s just a story.	ka tantara fotsiny io
The man saw her coming.	nahita azy tonga ilay lehilahy
I would love to see you like this.	tiako ny mahita anao toy izao
I should have known that you would know.	tokony ho fantatro fa ho fantatrao
It’s really great.	tena lehibe tokoa izany
So it shouldn’t be.	ka tsy tokony ho izany
One day, one of those days.	indray andro iray aminireo andro ireo
And he will do it.	dia hanao izany izy
The approach to this thing is supreme.	ny fomba aminity zavatra ity dia ambony indrindra
Don’t go down.	aza mandeha any ambany
However, there are many of these.	na izany aza dia misy maro aminireo
He likes it, of course.	tiany mazava ho azy
And that is still not enough.	ary mbola tsy ampy izany
I am there.	any aho
I could be the same.	mety ho toy izany koa aho
But it all seems pointless.	saingy toa tsy misy dikany daholo izany rehetra izany
You don’t like that either.	tsy tianao izany koa
It is necessary to look in a way.	ilaina ny mijery aminny fomba iray
What really matters is the facts.	ny tena zavadehibe dia ny zavamisy
It makes sense.	misy dikany izany hoe
We were very happy about that.	faly be izahay taminizany
Thank people for other great products.	misaotra olona aminny vokatra tsara hafa
I know now that he doesn’t love me.	fantatro izao fa tsy tia ahy izy
He was far away.	tany lavitra izy
It goes a long way.	lasa lavitra izany
On this great question we are one.	aminity fanontaniana lehibe ity dia iray ihany isika
Of course you can, easily.	mazava ho azy fa afaka mora
Probably because they are not the same.	angamba satria tsy mitovy
It doesn’t seem to have to be difficult.	toa tsy tokony ho sarotra izany
I love the truth.	ny marina no tiako
And they are dead.	ary efa maty izy ireo
He knew the truth about himself.	fantany ny marina momba azy
They should be, because they are fun.	tokony ho izy ireo satria mahafinaritra izy ireo
It's not right for him.	tsy mety ho azy izany
Many of them are meaningless.	maro aminizy ireo no tsy misy dikany
Sure now.	azo antoka fa izao
And now is a good time.	ary izao no fotoana tsara
However, this is not too bad.	na izany aza tsy dia ratsy loatra izany
It’s not that big.	tsy dia lehibe izany
What an idea.	hevitra inona izany
There were no new ideas.	tsy nisy hevitra vaovao
Every part of it.	ny ampahany rehetra aminizany
It’s just a lot of words.	teny be dia be fotsiny io
If you start that, they will come.	raha manomboka izany ianao dia ho avy izy ireo
It doesn’t go fast.	tsy mandeha haingana izany
It doesn’t get any better than that.	tsy mahazo tsara kokoa noho izany
Of course, there is a reason things start to happen.	mazava ho azy fa misy antony ny zavatra manomboka misy
One was in the early stages.	ny iray dia taminny dingana voalohany
It is not new or special to me.	tsy vaovao na manokana ho ahy ilay izy
He said it was good.	nilaza izy fa tsara izany
I'm glad to see that.	faly aho mahita izany
Of course you can own the car.	mazava ho azy fa afaka manana ny fiara ianao
But, it’s all part of the game.	saingy ampahany aminny lalao izany rehetra izany
There isn’t even a little bit.	tsy misy na dia kely aza
It can take a long time.	mety ho ela be izany
But he did not think so.	tsy nieritreritra izany anefa izy
They may not have a car.	mety tsy manana fiara izy ireo
Below is the photo gallery.	ity ambany ity ny sary sary
There is no question.	tsy misy fanontaniana
Less will be more.	kely kokoa no ho betsaka
One thing is missing.	zavatra iray no tsy hita
Too hard and no one.	mafy loatra ary tsy misy olona
There was no room for pictures.	tsy nisy toerana ho anny sary
He looks like the same one.	toy ny iray ihany izy
They all stopped.	nijanona izy rehetra
Not all men are the same.	tsy mitovy ny lehilahy rehetra
It’s really nothing.	tena tsy inona izany
They will have a great time.	hanao fotoana mahafinaritra izy ireo
Then, of course, he did.	avy eo mazava ho azy nanao izany izy
Doing good is the same.	ny manao ny tsara dia mitovy
Or you, therefore.	na ianao noho izany
And it should.	ary tokony
But we did.	izahay anefa dia nanao izany
It’s safer for him.	azo antoka kokoa ho azy izany
If we die here now, it really doesn’t make sense.	raha maty eto isika izao dia tena tsy misy dikany izany
But earning money is difficult.	sarotra anefa ny mahazo vola
It works as well as it should.	miasa tsara toy ny misy izany
Only two of all.	roa ihany aminireo rehetra ireo
He was never there when he needed her.	tsy teo mihitsy izy rehefa nila azy
Maybe they are, but certainly not now.	angamba izy ireo saingy azo antoka fa tsy izao
Maybe he was wrong.	angamba diso izy
Thanks for the truth.	misaotra noho ny marina
But thank you again.	fa misaotra anao indray
We need other methods as well.	mila fomba hafa koa
First, we had a really fun trip and a great time.	voalohany nanana dia tena nahafinaritra sy fotoana mahafinaritra izahay
Low but not too low.	ambany fa tsy ambany loatra
Not many of those around.	tsy maro aminireo manodidina
Everything is so fast.	haingana tokoa ny zavadrehetra
Checked the news.	nijery ny vaovao
And that’s not for sure.	ary tsy azo antoka izany
I am three for three.	telo noho telo aho
I can do that.	afaka manao izany aho
You just did it again.	vao avy nanao izany indray ianao
I think the event went well.	heveriko fa nandeha tsara ilay hetsika
I was always confused, looking at this man.	very hevitra foana aho nijery anio lehilahy io
Recent news.	vaovao vao haingana
Now is the time.	izao no fotoana
He looks at me closely.	mijery ahy akaiky izy
That’s kind of any person.	izany dia karazana na inona na inona olona
He doesn’t have it, not at all.	tsy manana izy tsy izany mihitsy
Now, the reality is completely different.	aminizao fotoana izao ny zavamisy dia hafa tanteraka
That was important to me.	zavadehibe tamiko izany
He could no longer do so.	tsy afaka nanao izany intsony izy
But now, look at him.	fa izao jereo izy
Many others have found themselves doing the same.	betsaka ny hafa nahita ny tenany nanao toy izany koa
It’s not fun at all.	tsy mahafinaritra mihitsy
Either way, it didn’t make much sense.	na izany na tsy izany dia tsy nisy dikany loatra izany
But there may be other reasons.	mety nisy antony hafa anefa
I'm not here anymore.	tsy eto intsony aho
And when the time comes, they will do so, if necessary.	ary rehefa tonga ny fotoana dia hanao izany izy ireo raha ilaina
It’s like, this is the real thing.	izany dia mitovy aminny hoe izao no tena izy
They could have had it.	afaka nanana izany izy ireo
He is also right.	marina koa izy
Absolutely no time.	tena tsy misy fotoana
Maybe he wasn’t happy.	angamba tsy faly izy
There are so many of them.	be dia be ireo
They were always fun.	nahafinaritra foana izy ireo
He can do whatever he wants with it.	afaka manao izay tiany atao aminizany izy
I got another car.	nahazo fiara hafa aho
He should be here now.	tokony ho eto izy izao
What a crazy day.	andro adala tokoa
Things are really good.	tena tsara ny zavatra
However, there are many things that can go wrong.	na izany aza misy zavatra maro mety ho diso
I think that’s still the case.	heveriko fa mbola izay no misy
He is very much like you.	tena mitovy aminao izy
That is certainly the case.	azo antoka fa izany no zavamisy
And we hope that both will be fulfilled soon.	ary manantena izahay fa samy ho tanteraka tsy ho ela
This thing is hard work.	asa mafy ity zavatra ity
But he couldn't say that.	saingy tsy afaka nilaza izany izy
None of this is true.	tsy misy marina izany na dia iray aza
Yes, of course.	eny tokoa mazava ho azy
I started this a long time ago.	efa ela aho no nanomboka izany
And it will be true.	ary ho marina izany
But not yet.	saingy tsy mbola
It's time.	fotoana izany
You don't see.	tsy mahita ianao
Lots of pictures.	betsaka ny sary
You don’t deserve anything.	tsy mendrika na inona na inona ianao
Everyone else is gone.	lasa daholo ny hafa
He is still gone.	mbola lasa izy
To me they are.	amiko izy ireo
All he knows and loves.	izay rehetra fantany sy tiany
It's been almost two years.	efa ho roa taona izao
It’s going to be too much.	ho lasa be loatra
We can even do it all together.	afaka manao izany rehetra izany mihitsy aza isika miaraka
However, there are two problems with this approach.	na izany aza misy olana roa aminity fomba ity
But he is not stupid.	tsy adala anefa izy
I thought that might be important.	nieritreritra aho fa mety ho zavadehibe izany
We drove.	nandeha fiara izahay
This is the picture.	izany no sary
It didn’t mean much to me.	tsy dia nisy dikany loatra tamiko izany
The choice is this.	ny safidy dia ity
It is always there.	eo foana izy io
And maybe that’s the idea.	ary angamba izany no hevitra
I didn’t make any money then, but maybe one day.	tsy nahazo vola taminizany fa angamba indray andro
They seemed to think differently.	toa nieritreritra hafa koa izy ireo
You can only do the first job and do it.	asa voalohany ihany no azonao atao ary atao izany
That is a question.	fanontaniana izany
Busy work in general.	asa be atao ankapobeny
It might be worth the idea.	mety ho mendrika izany ho anny hevitra
I know everything.	fantatro daholo
Sure, it still exists.	azo antoka fa mbola misy
For him, this is not possible.	ho azy dia tsy azo atao izany
We are different but also one.	samy hafa isika fa iray ihany koa
Efa.	efa
As in the old days.	toy ny taminny andro taloha
This is the right place for him.	io no toerana mety aminy
Intended to, perhaps.	natao ho angamba
We’ve been doing this for too long.	efa ela loatra izahay no nanao izany
One of my favorite places.	iray aminireo toerana tiako indrindra
Such stories are common.	ny tantara toy izany dia mahazatra
There is a problem.	misy olana
They lost everything.	very ny zavadrehetra izy ireo
In fact, there are two such paths.	raha ny marina dia misy lalana roa toy izany
Not long ago they did.	tsy ela akory izay dia nanao izany izy ireo
Yes, that could be the problem.	eny mety ho izany no olana
This is a new house.	trano vaovao io
For him, it was important.	ho azy dia zavadehibe izany
He will be better than that, he said.	ho tsara kokoa noho izany izy hoy izy
Almost automatically.	saika mandeha ho azy
It seems so crazy to me.	toa adala be amiko
It won't even come close.	tsy ho akaiky akory izany
Not here, not now, not like this.	tsy eto tsy izao tsy toy izao
He is not far from us.	tsy lavitra anay izy
But in a good way.	fa aminny fomba tsara
I didn't look at them.	tsy nijery azy ireo aho
But it is very simple.	tena tsotra anefa izany
You have a history.	manana tantara ianao
His is yours.	ny azy dia anao
What needs to be done now.	izay mila atao aminizao fotoana izao
But you are right.	tena marina anefa ianao
Yes, and then the other one.	eny ary avy eo ilay iray hafa
It's not like he needed that money.	tsy toy ny hoe nila anio vola io izy
Because it will be good.	satria ho tsara izany
You should be happy.	tokony ho faly ianao
That you are not alone.	ny hoe tsy irery ianao
That's what it means.	izany no dikany
Day or night.	andro na alina
But he will.	fa hanao izany izy
But he still had some problems.	mbola nanana olana kely anefa izy
Look, look you.	jereo jereo ianao
Many have already done so.	efa maro no nanao izany
Or it seems already.	na toa efa
It was full.	feno ilay izy
Everyone is watching now.	mijery izao ny rehetra
And it’s absolutely true about that.	ary marina tanteraka ny momba izany
Things just don’t seem possible.	toa tsy azo atao mihitsy ny zavatra
Then came the really big question.	dia tonga ny fanontaniana tena lehibe
No matter what, it didn’t really happen.	na inona na inona tsy tena nisy izany
There’s no two ways about it, it’s just fun.	tsy misy fomba roa momba anio mahafinaritra fotsiny izany
Common things don’t go wrong.	zavatra mahazatra tsy diso
That is a true idea.	izany dia hevitra marina
Crazy for me.	adala amiko
I've seen you.	efa nahita anao aho
And of course that is true.	ary mazava ho azy fa marina izany
This is the highest possible.	izany no ambony indrindra azo atao
Only the first part of this story is true.	ny ampahany voalohany aminity tantara ity ihany no marina
I saw a man on the ground, dead.	nahita lehilahy iray teo aminny tany aho maty
He couldn't think of them.	tsy afaka nieritreritra azy ireo izy
You have to be a big man.	tsy maintsy lehilahy lehibe ianao
Finally, but not yet.	farany fa tsy mbola
The day began, not the war.	nanomboka ny andro fa tsy ny ady
But that should not be a big problem.	tsy tokony ho olana lehibe anefa izany
Otherwise, he had a really good day.	raha tsy izany dia nanana andro tena tsara izy
Look at the ground.	jereo ny tany
We had to be there for them.	tsy maintsy tany ho azy ireo izahay
But now it’s hard to see, a bit vague.	sarotra hita anefa izy izao somary tsy mazava
It doesn’t seem to be a problem.	toa tsy olana izany
That was my problem.	izay no olana tamiko
i love you so much	tiako loatra ianao
I don't know what.	tsy fantatro hoe inona
Do it now.	ataovy izany aminizao fotoana izao
It seems familiar about these images.	toa mahazatra ny momba ireo sary ireo
It doesn’t work in any way.	tsy misy miasa aminny fomba rehetra izany
Then the question began.	dia nanomboka ny fanontaniana
But the pictures are not enough.	tsy ampy anefa ny sary
But we need all three.	mila azy telo anefa isika
Yes, you were not wrong then, and you are not wrong now.	eny tsy diso ianao taminizany ary tsy diso ianao ankehitriny
Really looked at him.	tena nijery azy
That is the big problem.	izany no olana lehibe
I have both and they are fun.	samy manana aho ary mahafinaritra izy ireo
Very happy with the results.	tena faly aminny vokatra
Real work is also hard.	mafy koa ny tena asa
Surely you are happy.	azo antoka fa faly ianao
Everything in it.	izay rehetra ao anatiny
It won’t be much.	tsy ho be dia be izany
More recently,.	vao haingana kokoa
This method is simple and fast.	ity fomba ity dia tsotra sy haingana
It seems too easy.	toa mora loatra izany
You can’t get lost fast.	tsy afaka very haingana ianao
Surely they will.	azo antoka fa hanao izany izy ireo
At first he was great.	taminny voalohany dia lehibe izy
The same is true for problem areas.	dia toy izany koa ho anny toerana misy olana
He is not big, and he is not small.	tsy lehibe izy ary tsy kely
We can't do it again.	tsy afaka manao izany indray isika
Both are gone.	samy lasa
But he is only human.	fa izy ihany no olona
I would never have thought of that.	tsy ho nieritreritra izany mihitsy aho
You have to start now.	tsy maintsy manomboka izao ianao
He still has the upper hand.	mbola manana ny ambony izy
I think this is a true story.	heveriko fa tantara marina ity
But that is not possible in today's world.	tsy azo atao anefa izany raha ny zavamisy ankehitriny
Enough is enough.	efa ampy ny zavatra atao
I'm still watching.	mbola mijery aho
Maybe that’s okay.	angamba mety izany
It still didn’t make sense.	mbola tsy nisy dikany mihitsy
Yes, you haven’t done that yet.	eny mbola tsy nanao izany ianao
Those who can do as they please.	ireo izay afaka manao araka izay tiany
Here and now is what matters.	eto ary izao no zavadehibe
The place was upstairs.	teo ambony teo ilay toerana
And you make sense.	ary misy dikany ianao
It seems like a different world.	toa tontolo hafa izany
But the real world is not like that.	tsy toy izany anefa ny tontolo tena izy
The bad news is everything else.	ny vaovao ratsy dia ny zavatra hafa rehetra
I look at it.	mijery izany aho
We are doing good things.	manao zavatra tsara izahay
It was still his.	mbola azy ihany ilay izy
And you can just see it.	ary afaka mahita izany fotsiny ianao
Yes, next year may be different.	eny mety ho hafa ny taona manaraka
Very fast.	haingana tokoa
It all works.	izany rehetra izany dia miasa
We need real stories from real people.	mila tantara tena izy avy aminny olona tena izy izahay
He said.	dia hoy izy
I want to be one.	tiako ny ho iray
Sometimes, the latter option is the easiest and fastest.	indraindray ny safidy farany dia mora sy haingana indrindra
No one did it, unless they knew the story.	tsy nisy nanao izany raha tsy fantany ny tantara
Saw a lot.	nahita be
At first everything was fine.	taminny voalohany dia tsara daholo
It also seems too good if not true.	toa tsara loatra koa izany raha tsy marina
The idea is completely wrong.	diso tanteraka ilay hevitra
I always come here.	tonga eto foana aho
It’s just hard.	mafy fotsiny ilay izy
Or maybe he never thought.	na angamba tsy nieritreritra mihitsy izy
So, it’s really important.	noho izany zavadehibe tokoa izany
I always thought it was for me.	nieritreritra foana aho fa ho ahy izany
Like, right away.	toy ny avy hatrany
Very difficult, but not like us.	sarotra be fa tsy toa antsika
We can be the same.	mety ho toy izany koa isika
And in fact, very fast.	ary raha ny marina tena haingana
He alone does it.	izy ihany no manao izany
This is the real problem.	io no tena olana
I also have a difficult life.	manana fiainana sarotra koa aho
I have to see the old, the new.	tsy maintsy hitako ny taloha ny vaovao
And there really is.	ary tena misy
They were driving.	nandeha fiara izy ireo
Maybe only once.	indray mandeha ihany angamba
There is nothing more you can do here.	tsy misy azonao atao intsony eto
And so it has always been.	ary toy izany foana
Life, however, is a bit more ordinary.	ny fiainana na izany aza dia somary mahazatra kokoa
This place looks good.	toa tsara io toerana io
You look bad.	toa ratsy ianao
The reason is unclear.	tsy mazava ny antony
Too much work and not enough time.	be loatra ny asa ary tsy ampy ny fotoana
It is like.	dia toy ny
The food was small, but the food was very good.	ny sakafo dia kely fa ny sakafo dia tena tsara
If he ever saw someone again.	raha mbola nahita olona indray izy
We need to follow two steps.	mila manaraka dingana roa isika
It was never needed.	tsy nila izany mihitsy
Another for the next two.	ny iray hafa ho anny roa manaraka
Likewise, around.	toy izany koa manodidina
Everything goes faster.	mandeha haingana kokoa ny zavadrehetra
You are not alone.	tsy ianao irery
He liked the word.	nahafinaritra azy ny teny
It shouldn’t have been upstairs before.	tsy tokony ho tany ambony tany aloha
But it was not in it.	tsy tao anatiny anefa ilay izy
One day you may be good and bad.	indray andro dia mety ho tsara sy ratsy ianao
Look at the picture.	jereo ilay sary
No one is more beautiful than the other.	tsy nisy olona tsara tarehy noho ny hafa
That part will be easy.	ho mora izany ampahany izany
It seems like a simple idea to me.	toa hevitra tsotra izany amiko
Not easy and not fast.	tsy mora ary tsy haingana
If not this year, then next.	raha tsy aminity taona ity dia aminny manaraka
Some may never do that.	ny sasany angamba tsy hanao izany mihitsy
And yet, very similar.	ary na izany aza mitovy be
It could be more.	mety ho maro kokoa izany
The same may be true of you.	mety ho marina aminao koa izany
I really like that idea.	tena tiako be io hevitra io
If you need to do it, do it.	raha mila manao izany ianao dia ataovy izany
Of course, it has to be that way.	mazava ho azy fa tsy maintsy ho toy izany
It could be very different.	mety ho hafa mihitsy ilay izy
Yes, he would.	eny ho nanao izany izy
It doesn’t happen when the time comes.	tsy tanteraka izany rehefa tonga ny fotoana
This is not a good and bad conversation.	tsy resaka tsara sy ratsy izany
It’s not the same as him.	tsy mitovy aminny azy izany
He had to see it.	tsy maintsy nahita izany izy
You know that's not true.	fantatrao fa tsy marina izany
And it got there.	ary tonga tao
Only his location is different.	ny toerana misy azy ihany no hafa
I went hard.	nandeha mafy aho
That seems really important.	toa zavadehibe tokoa izany
We watched and watched and watched.	nijery sy nijery ary nijery izahay
Pictures and photos.	sary sy sary
I still do.	mbola manao izany aho
If it works, fine.	raha miasa dia tsara
He had thought a lot.	efa nieritreritra be izy
Look at them.	jereo izy ireo
I really enjoy working for them.	tena tiako ny miasa ho azy ireo
He is different from himself.	izy dia hafa noho ny tenany
I see that I know.	hitako fa fantatro
I really like them.	tena tia azy ireo aho
We have no time to lose.	tsy manana fotoana ho very isika
They just went.	nandeha fotsiny izy ireo
We had it all.	dia nanana ny rehetra
Now, that’s different.	ankehitriny hafa izany
He really wouldn’t like it.	tena tsy ho tiany izany
I will never do this again.	tsy hanao toy izao intsony aho
And that’s where the hard choices lie.	ary eo no misy ny safidy sarotra
Each product is small.	ny vokatra tsirairay dia kely
He may never come again.	mety tsy ho tonga indray izy
That’s just life.	izany ihany no fiainana
So nothing came of it.	ka tsy nisy na inona na inona tonga taminizany
This is where they were.	io no toerana nisy azy ireo
He knew he didn't.	fantany fa tsy nanao izany izy
He knew he was lost now.	fantany fa very izy izao
They are just lost.	very fotsiny izy ireo
People can always do that at any time.	afaka manao izany foana ny olona aminny fotoana rehetra
you don't understand.	tsy azonao
You know they come this way.	fantatrao fa tonga aminity lalana ity izy ireo
Not in the game at all.	tsy aminny lalao mihitsy
The movement finds its way.	ny hetsika dia mahita lalana
In fact, there is one or two other things.	raha ny marina misy zavatra iray na roa hafa
You can go without anything.	afaka mandeha tsy misy na inona na inona ianao
There were not a single bad word.	tsy nisy teny ratsy na dia iray aza
It’s small, and it’s important.	kely izy io ary zavadehibe
He stopped and looked around.	nijanona izy ary nijery ny manodidina
He told me that.	nilaza izany tamiko izy
Arrive at his wonderful place.	tonga any aminny toerana mahafinaritra azy
I always thought about it.	nieritreritra izany foana
He’s just crazy.	adala fotsiny izy
Yes, you can now.	eny azonao atao izao
I love those days.	tiako ireo andro ireo
But there are two problems.	misy olana roa anefa
It wasn’t the worst of it.	tsy izany no ratsy indrindra taminizany
Nothing can be done.	tsy misy zavatra azo atao
But it goes better.	fa mandeha tsara kokoa
It was hard to see that.	sarotra ny nahita izany
So you start working and you start working.	noho izany dia manomboka miasa ianao ary manomboka miasa
There are people in it.	misy olona ao anatiny
He didn't say anything to her.	tsy nilaza na inona na inona taminy izy
As there have been many others.	toy ny efa nisy maro hafa
I went alone.	nandeha irery aho
I can do anything for everyone.	afaka manao ny zavadrehetra ho anny rehetra aho
This is not bad money.	tsy vola ratsy izany
I have seen him as before.	efa hitako toy ny taloha izy
He looks like such a small man.	toa lehilahy kely toy izany izy
But absolutely not.	fa tena tsia
I didn't see the man inside.	tsy hitako ilay lehilahy tao anatiny
In fact, much is missing.	raha ny marina betsaka no tsy ampy
He was still downstairs, somewhere.	mbola teo ambany izy tany ho any
He had a complete idea of ​​her.	nanana hevitra tanteraka momba azy izy
Life is simpler now.	tsotra kokoa ny fiainana ankehitriny
It may be small.	mety ho kely izany
Sometimes it seems impossible.	indraindray dia toa tsy azo atao izany
Yes, that’s something else.	eny zavatra hafa izany
But there was another way.	nisy fomba hafa anefa
These cars are to come.	ireo fiara ireo no ho avy
Start again.	manomboka indray
I may have done something wrong with the game.	mety ho diso zavatra aminny lalao aho
Yes, this is it.	eny izao no izy
I didn’t get another job.	tsy nahazo asa hafa aho
This is a great story.	tantara lehibe izany
For others, it is yet to come.	ho anny hafa mbola ho avy
But for the wrong reasons.	fa noho ny antony diso
Now, don’t get me wrong.	ankehitriny aza diso aho
They are gone.	lasa izy ireo
For the money, it looks good.	ho anny vola dia toa tsara izany
He really loves you, you know.	tena tia anao izy fantatrao
So that he will never come again.	mba tsy ho tonga intsony izy
And it’s not all lost yet.	ary mbola tsy very daholo
That’s not possible, for sure.	tsy azo atao izany azo antoka
That time is long gone.	efa ela izany fotoana izany
They do nothing.	tsy manao na inona na inona izy ireo
I was so happy to see this game !!.	faly be aho nahita ity lalao ity
The last word in the picture.	ny teny farany aminny sary
It does not exist in the real world.	tsy misy aminny tontolo tena izy io
If he really died.	raha tena maty tokoa izy
It’s in everything.	ao aminny zavadrehetra izany
They and many more deserve it all.	mendrika izany rehetra izany izy ireo sy ny maro hafa
And they look great.	ary hita fa lehibe izy ireo
Despite this, it still exists.	na dia eo aza izany dia mbola misy ihany
Only they can do it.	izy ireo ihany no afaka manao izany
And in fact there is.	ary raha ny marina dia misy
But you never know.	saingy tsy fantatrao mihitsy
He always knows what is right for him.	fantany foana ny zavatra mety aminy
This is simply not true.	tsy ny marina fotsiny izany
And do this journey in the usual way.	ary manao ity dia ity aminny fomba mahazatra
Just fast.	haingana ihany
He still doesn't like it.	mbola tsy tiany izany
I don't see any other option.	tsy hitako izay safidy hafa
Not really a dead person.	tsy tena olona maty
There seems to be no end to the work.	toa tsy misy farany ny asa
Do everything everywhere.	ataovy eny rehetra eny ny zavatra rehetra
If you like things like that, fine.	raha tianao ny zavatra toy izany tsara
And there it was.	ary nisy tokoa izany
If you’re not happy about that, you’re not alone.	raha tsy faly aminizany ianao dia tsy irery ianao
You are not with me.	tsy miaraka amiko ianao
He could tell he was not happy.	afaka nilaza izy fa tsy faly izy
It’s just hard to find.	sarotra fotsiny ny mahita azy
He probably is too.	izy koa angamba
I don’t see what this game is but it’s fun.	tsy hitako izay lalao ity fa mahafinaritra
Don’t get me wrong here.	aza diso hevitra eto
It’s all just a game.	lalao ihany izany rehetra izany
Maybe you will never be free.	angamba tsy ho afaka mihitsy
I never saw it.	tsy nahita mihitsy aho
You can do this in many ways.	afaka manao izany aminny fomba maro ianao
But not good enough.	tsy ampy tsara anefa
Yes, we really did.	eny tena nanao izany izahay
It seems so, to me.	toa izany amiko
The better is finally here.	tonga ihany ny tsara kokoa
When it works, it’s fun.	raha miasa dia mahafinaritra
There was no word from him.	tsy nisy teny avy taminy
I think it’s beautiful.	heveriko fa tsara tarehy
Very good part.	ampahany tena tsara
These were wonderful people.	olona nahafinaritra ireo
But it is small.	kely ihany anefa izany
Sometimes, some things are too good to be true.	indraindray ny zavatra sasany dia tsara loatra ka tsy ho marina
Another work was done.	asa hafa indray no natao
It’s really fun here.	mahafinaritra tokoa ny eto
The process is safe and secure, fast and easy.	ny dingana dia azo antoka sy azo antoka haingana sy mora
There must be something else for him.	tsy maintsy misy zavatra hafa ho azy
And now one of them is misplaced.	ary ankehitriny dia diso toerana ny iray aminizy ireo
He wanted to be close to me.	te ho akaiky ahy izy
So that’s a big step !.	noho izany dia dingana lehibe izany
You are so wrong.	tena diso ianao
Not just men.	tsy ny lehilahy ihany
It’s a difficult story.	tantara sarotra izy io
It can even be personal.	mety ho anny tena manokana aza
It will be a difficult task.	ho asa sarotra izany
We will get there.	ho tonga any izahay
He is all mine.	izy no ahy rehetra
I never did that again.	tsy nanao izany intsony aho
In such work, you see results.	aminny asa toy izany dia mahita vokatra ianao
You are the best of the best.	ianao no tsara indrindra aminny tsara indrindra
Yes, it is also possible.	eny azo atao koa izany
Not a house, but still very small.	tsy trano fa mbola kely dia kely
This place is just like any other.	ity toerana ity dia mitovy aminny hafa rehetra
I might get lost in this.	mety ho very aho aminity
We were able to do great things.	afaka nanao zavatra lehibe izahay
We have never done anything wrong even once.	tsy nanao ratsy mihitsy izahay na dia indray mandeha aza
This one seems to be getting ugly at first.	toa lasa ratsy tarehy aloha ity iray ity
We both work hard.	samy miasa mafy izahay
Maybe you’ll understand better.	angamba ho azonao kokoa
In fact, the choice is not his.	raha ny marina tsy azy ny safidy
He said he wanted to be honest with me.	nilaza izy fa te hanao ny marina amiko
And you are right that they are beautiful.	ary marina ny anao fa tsara tarehy izy ireo
While he was there.	raha mbola teo izy
He is very good to me.	tena tsara amiko izy
You know, just like before.	fantatrao toy ny taloha ihany
You like it now.	tianao izany aminizao fotoana izao
He can't walk anymore.	tsy afaka mandeha intsony izy
The problem seems really big.	toa lehibe tokoa ilay olana
But he couldn't find anything there.	tsy nahita na inona na inona intsony anefa izy tao
It seemed fun.	toa nahafinaritra
It’s around as far as we’re used to.	manodidina ny lavitra araka ny mahazatra antsika izany
But this is not difficult.	tsy sarotra anefa izany
History went too fast.	nandeha haingana loatra ny tantara
Both get good words, far and wide.	samy mahazo teny tsara lavitra
So we have to do it.	noho izany dia tsy maintsy manao izany isika
Bad, bad, bad.	ratsy ratsy ratsy
The parts are really good.	tena tsara ny ampahany
War from the word go.	ady avy aminny teny hoe mandeha
And no, that's not why.	ary tsia tsy izany no antony
Still made for.	mbola natao ho anny
They work well.	miasa tsara izy ireo
And he knew.	ary fantany
Whatever the same question.	na inona na inona fanontaniana mitovy
However, life there is still beautiful.	na izany aza mbola tsara tarehy ny fiainana any
He is free.	afaka izy
The good news is there are other ways.	ny vaovao tsara dia misy fomba hafa
But he might do it.	mety hanao izany anefa izy
They are not beautiful people.	tsy olona tsara tarehy izy ireo
I know someone does that.	fantatro fa misy olona manao izany
Now, and for good.	ankehitriny ary ho aminny tsara
I have good money.	manana vola tsara aho
I don't want you with me.	tsy tiako ianao miaraka amiko
It’s not just for me but for everyone.	tsy ho ahy ihany izany fa ho anny rehetra
But he got nothing else.	tsy nahazo zavatra hafa anefa izy
I was so wrong.	tena diso hevitra aho
I don't need a part of it.	tsy mila ampahany aminy aho
So they do nothing.	ka tsy manao na inona na inona
First it is close.	voalohany dia akaiky
Or good.	na tsara
There is still something else to be found there.	mbola misy zavatra hafa ho hita ao
It seemed to me.	toa ahy ilay izy
Time is more difficult for them.	sarotra kokoa ho azy ireo ny fotoana
Not for him.	tsy ho azy
Not that he will.	tsy hoe hanao izany izy
The last you get.	ny farany azonao
Also if anyone has any questions.	ary koa raha misy manana fanontaniana
I haven't done any of these yet.	tsy mbola nanao ny iray aminireo
It is not good for them.	tsy tsara ho azy ireo izany
It could be really good.	mety ho tena tsara
Well, maybe he already had one of them.	eny angamba efa nanana iray taminy izy
It’s different, different.	hafa io hafa
Not a woman.	tsy vehivavy iray akory
But then it becomes a bit difficult.	saingy avy eo dia lasa somary sarotra
You won’t know he has one.	tsy ho fantatrao fa manana iray izy
It will not be like this.	tsy ho toy izao izany
He was three.	telo izy
I need life.	mila fiainana aho
They surround each other.	manodidina ny tsirairay avy izy ireo
It's in the news.	ao aminny vaovao izany
He didn't seem to see me.	toa tsy nahita ahy izy
It seems very possible.	toa tena azo atao izany
It’s even bigger.	mbola lehibe kokoa izany
Perhaps that could be more accurate.	angamba mety ho marina kokoa izany
It's really bad.	tena ratsy tokoa
Everything about him is true.	marina daholo ny momba azy
But we have another way.	saingy manana fomba hafa isika
There has to be something around here.	tsy maintsy misy manodidina eto
And you again.	ary ianao indray
Then it fills up quickly.	dia feno haingana izany
When he didn’t, he did.	rehefa tsy nanao izany izy dia nanao azy
The person who started the conversation had a reason.	nanana antony ilay olona nanomboka ny resaka
I had nothing left for me.	tsy nanana na inona na inona ho ahy intsony aho
Maybe not necessary, but there you are.	angamba tsy ilaina fa eo ianao
But that is another question.	saingy fanontaniana hafa mihitsy izany
Only one remained.	iray ihany no nijanona
Then you say again.	dia hoy indray ianao
Well, it’s easy.	tsara mora izany
Overall we had a good day.	aminny ankapobeny dia nanana andro tsara izahay
He might have been happy to do anything.	mety ho faly izy nanao na inona na inona
It's all gone.	lasa ny rehetra
Which is probably not the case.	izay angamba tsy izany
It’s easy and it works for me.	mora ilay izy ary miasa amiko
You enjoy life.	mahafinaritra anao ny fiainana
So is life.	toy izany koa ny fiainana
But he could not do that either.	tsy afaka nanao izany koa anefa izy
It's not about money.	tsy avy aminny vola izy
I like the two things together.	tiako ny zavatra roa miaraka
He used to do that.	nanao izany izy taloha
He saw everything.	nahita ny zavadrehetra izy
It’s about history.	momba ny tantara izany
This is not a job for stupid people.	tsy asa ho anny olona adala izany
We don't need you here.	tsy mila anao eto izahay
Same as me.	mitovy aminny ahy
Everything is too complicated.	sarotra loatra ny zavadrehetra
But that did not work.	tsy nandeha anefa izany
We'll be there in two or three days.	afaka roa na telo andro izahay
But that was too much for me.	be loatra anefa izany tamiko
They are almost identical.	saika mitovy ihany izy ireo
This is good news.	vaovao nahafinaritra izany
Which works for me.	izay miasa ho ahy
But this is not just a place.	tsy toerana fotsiny anefa ity
Life will never be easy.	tsy ho mora mihitsy ny fiainana
Sometimes it doesn’t work.	indraindray dia tsy mandeha izany
But there are no specific words.	saingy tsy misy teny manokana
It really suits me.	tena mety amiko izany
That's a really bad idea.	tena hevitra ratsy izany
Now, there is something else.	ankehitriny misy zavatra hafa
These are new women.	vehivavy vaovao ireo
And it could have been fun.	ary mety ho nahafinaritra
Some have.	ny sasany dia manana
But that's the.	fa izay ilay
Another man, another unknown.	lehilahy iray hafa iray tsy fantany
He is truly one of the greatest.	tena iray aminireo lehibe indrindra izy
This is how it always works.	toy izany foana no miasa
There should be enough food for everyone.	tokony ho ampy ho anny rehetra ny sakafo
I have nothing else.	tsy manana zavatra hafa mihitsy aho
We have a car.	manana fiara izahay
I need a lot of money.	mila vola be aho
It was hard.	dia mafy ilay izy
Here, however.	eto anefa
No, not anyone else.	tsia tsy olona hafa
It started to make sense.	nanomboka nisy dikany izany
And everyone had it.	ary nanana izany ny rehetra
We are so wrong.	tena diso izahay
But there was no other way.	tsy nisy fomba hafa anefa
I have never seen anything like it.	mbola tsy nahita zavatra toy izany mihitsy aho
It was three days.	telo andro izany
He doesn’t need or need money anymore.	tsy mila na mila vola intsony izy
Of course, he did not do such a thing.	mazava ho azy fa tsy nanao zavatra toy izany izy
Sometimes it’s better not to look.	indraindray dia tsara kokoa ny tsy mijery
I usually do that.	matetika aho no manao izany
He got nothing.	tsy nahazo na inona na inona izy
He should have seen it.	tokony ho nahita azy izy
But there is also no choice.	tsy misy safidy koa anefa
It's at night.	aminny alina izany
It doesn’t seem right either.	toa tsy mety koa
But that’s not the big deal.	saingy tsy izany no olana lehibe
Yes, you have come to the right place.	eny tonga aminny toerana mety ianao
This may be true of other things.	mety ho marina izany aminny zavatra hafa
This is not a debate.	tsy ady hevitra izany
And that’s not a good thing.	ary tsy zavatra tsara izany
And then the final question.	ary avy eo ny fanontaniana farany
Now he knows it makes more sense.	ankehitriny dia fantany fa misy dikany bebe kokoa izany
Then you can follow anything.	avy eo dia afaka manaraka na inona na inona na inona na inona
Which is really not true.	izay tena tsy marina
I took steps.	nanao dingana aho
That’s a clear issue.	resaka mazava izany
And a good idea of ​​what he likes.	ary hevitra tsara momba izay tiany
It’s not like history.	tsy mitovy aminny tantara
He himself told me that.	izy mihitsy no nilaza tamiko izany
It could be a completely different story.	mety ho tantara hafa tanteraka izany
Something like that.	zavatra toa azy
There he did it again.	teo dia nanao izany indray izy
That sounds like a lot.	toa be dia be izany
Here is a man who loves you.	ity misy lehilahy tia anao
He still deserves it.	mbola mendrika izany izy
He should do the same.	tokony hanao toy izany koa izy
But there is another big problem.	saingy misy olana lehibe hafa
There was another reason.	nisy antony hafa koa
You are not sure.	tsy mahazo antoka ianao
I know the story.	fantatro ny tantara
He was the other man.	izy ilay lehilahy hafa
If he said.	raha hoy izy
He never walked alone.	tsy nandeha irery mihitsy izy
Only the best people.	ny olona tsara indrindra ihany
All these actions appear to be insignificant.	ireo hetsika rehetra ireo dia hita fa tsy misy dikany
Maybe you can’t do it once though.	angamba tsy afaka manao izany indray mandeha anefa
If you’re not, you’re not.	raha tsy izany ianao dia tsy izany
It’s fast, simple and straightforward.	haingana sy tsotra ary tsotra izany
The year is good.	tsara ny taona
I couldn’t do anything about it.	tsy afaka nanao na inona na inona momba izany aho
But to me, it’s just a small thing.	fa amiko zavatra kely fotsiny
It's difficult for them.	sarotra aminizany izy ireo
But we weren’t too fast.	tsy dia haingana loatra anefa izahay
Well, sometimes, it’s perfect.	eny ary indraindray tanteraka izany
But then really, he wondered what it was.	fa avy eo dia tena nieritreritra izy hoe inona izany
Of course, everyone does.	mazava ho azy fa manao izany ny rehetra
Something else around him.	zavatra hafa manodidina azy
He looked good, he said.	nijery tsara izy hoy izy
He knows everything about her.	fantany daholo ny momba azy
Do this at all times.	ataovy aminny fotoana rehetra izany
Especially when he’s right.	indrindra fa rehefa marina izy
And you will be.	ary ianao dia ho
Not in words, but in deeds.	tsy aminny teny fa aminny asa
This is new to me.	vaovao amiko izany
Of course now.	mazava ho azy izao
It’s a crazy job.	asa adala io
night again maybe.	alina indray angamba
But it turned out that he was the only one with problems.	hita anefa fa izy irery no nanana olana
Maybe he was in it.	angamba tao anatiny izy
Sure, in fact.	azo antoka fa raha ny marina
That’s really good right now.	tena tsara izany aminizao fotoana izao
It’s important to dedicate time to what you love.	zavadehibe ny manokana fotoana aminny zavatra tianao
Then he left again.	dia lasa indray izy
They also have good options.	manana safidy tsara koa izy ireo
Do it or not.	ataovy na tsia
I really like them now.	tena tiako izy ireo ankehitriny
This appears to not work.	izany dia hita fa tsy miasa
It's a long way to go.	lavitra ny dia
Just another house.	trano hafa fotsiny
They said you were crazy.	nilaza izy ireo fa adala ianao
Unless it's just not right.	raha tsy hoe tsy mety ho azy
They are well worth the money.	tena mendrika ny vola izy ireo
But it does not follow.	tsy manaraka izany anefa
Thank you for that, they said.	misaotra noho izany hoy izy ireo
It’s a simpler way of life.	fomba tsotra kokoa aminny fiainana izany
All of this is not true.	tsy marina izany rehetra izany
Now there are two options.	ankehitriny dia misy safidy roa
But there are times.	misy fotoana anefa
It could be good, it could be bad.	mety ho tsara mety ho ratsy
It has never been and never will be.	tsy mbola nisy izany ary tsy hisy mihitsy izany
Every action, everything.	ny hetsika rehetra ny zavadrehetra
I know you are not happy.	fantatro fa tsy faly ianao
With the car no.	miaraka aminny fiara no
I am very new to this.	tena vaovao aho aminizany
He had never seen anything like them before.	mbola tsy nahita toa azy ireo mihitsy izy taloha
The man came.	tonga ilay lehilahy
This man has a lot of money.	vola be io lehilahy io
The picture seems to be correct.	toa marina ilay sary
So they don’t exist.	noho izany dia tsy misy izy ireo
He loves me sometimes.	tiany aho indraindray
They shouldn’t be long.	tsy tokony ho ela izy ireo
He did not start the story.	tsy izy no nanomboka ny tantara
But there was always.	fa nisy foana
But you have to come first.	tsy maintsy tonga aloha anefa ianao
Do the most important things first.	ataovy aloha ny zavadehibe indrindra
But this picture is too simple.	tsotra loatra anefa ity sary ity
Yes, do it again.	eny ataovy indray izao
Then, on.	avy eo aminny
We were not long there.	tsy ela izahay no teo
I know this is often not the case.	fantatro fa matetika tsy izany no izy
It’s a choice you can make.	safidy azonao atao izany
Gone, gone, became supreme.	lasa lasa lasa ambony indrindra
They are both good.	tsara izy roa
So that’s good.	noho izany dia tsara izany
These are the best.	ireo no tsara indrindra
It seems to be gone now.	toa lasa izao
I'm so happy.	faly loatra aho
He had never seen anything like it before.	mbola tsy nahita zavatra toy izany mihitsy izy taloha
Check out the news.	jereo ny vaovao
But then he knew he couldn’t.	saingy fantany avy eo fa tsy afaka
We seem to have a problem.	toa manana olana isika
You understand everything.	azonao ny zavadrehetra
This is not true for long.	tsy marina ela izany
We are finally free.	afaka ihany izahay farany
It was just a matter of style.	resaka fomba fotsiny no natao
But that seems important to you.	toa zavadehibe aminao anefa izany
These are very important.	tena zavadehibe ireo
He got no more money.	tsy nahazo vola hafa izy
It really makes sense !.	tena misy dikany tokoa
I like it, actually.	tiako izany raha ny marina
There is absolutely nothing wrong with that.	tena tsy misy diso izany
Then we begin.	dia manomboka isika
I usually don’t see anything.	tsy mahita na inona na inona aho matetika
That is what war is all about.	izany no atao hoe ady
It really made sense.	tena nisy dikany izany
It’s pretty cool, if it doesn’t work well.	tena tsara tarehy izy io raha tsy miasa tsara
It was not like a human being.	tsy toy ny olona akory ilay izy
If he doesn’t, we probably won’t.	raha tsy manao izany izy dia mety tsy hanao izany isika
It’s a bit too much for me.	somary be amiko izany
There aren’t many but there can be.	tsy misy maro fa mety misy
In this way, it works well.	aminizany dia miasa tsara izy io
And we are on our way.	ary eo aminny lalana izahay
What could it be? 	inona no mety ho izy
He simply knew he had to have it.	fantany tsotra izao fa tsy maintsy manana izany izy
Went to.	nandeha tany aminny
And not too big.	ary tsy dia lehibe loatra
The question is not whether they had it or not.	ny fanontaniana dia tsy hoe nanana izy ireo na tsia
I have to go to work now.	tsy maintsy mandeha miasa aho izao
Just look at him.	jereo fotsiny izy
You are not like them.	tsy mitovy aminizy ireo ianao
I could see him too.	afaka nahita azy koa aho
If only there was something.	raha mba nisy zavatra
But look here.	fa jereo eto
You don’t need these.	tsy mila ireo
I love this place.	tiako io toerana io
Only one of the three is still together.	iray aminizy telo ihany no mbola miaraka
But there was something about it.	nisy zavatra momba izany anefa
These men did not stop.	tsy nijanona ireo lehilahy ireo
They are ours.	izy ireo dia antsika
And the food, of course.	ary ny sakafo mazava ho azy
We are not like you.	tsy mitovy aminao izahay
You have been free for a long time.	efa ela ianao no afaka
I found it fun.	hitako fa nahafinaritra
As for the story, it was really fun.	raha ny tantara dia tena nahafinaritra
It all looks good now.	toa tsara daholo izao
They are smaller.	kely kokoa izy ireo
This is not a good thing at all.	tsy zavatra tsara mihitsy izany
They were only there because of that.	nisy ihany izy ireo noho izany
If the product does not work, there is a problem.	raha tsy miasa ny vokatra dia misy olana
I don’t even know they do.	tsy fantatro akory hoe manao izany izy ireo
I don't like him very much.	tsy dia tia azy loatra
You have to know what you want.	tsy maintsy fantatrao izay tianao
So now.	ka izao
The game is near.	efa akaiky ny lalao
I never loved him.	tsy tia azy mihitsy
There is something special about this one.	misy zavatra manokana momba ity iray ity
But no, no.	fa tsia tsia
He didn’t even know about it.	tsy fantany akory ny momba izany
Bad choice as it turns out.	ratsy safidy araka ny hita
So they went to it.	dia nandeha taminizany izy ireo
There is a real world.	misy tontolo tena izy
We are in a very safe place.	ao aminny toerana tena azo antoka isika
He looks down.	mijery ambany izy
Bad things in the past.	zavatra ratsy taloha
All the facts.	ny zavamisy rehetra
But it’s not the same as the game.	saingy tsy mitovy aminny lalao izany
And at the time it was very important.	ary taminizany fotoana izany dia tena zavadehibe
Maybe from just one or two.	angamba avy aminny iray na roa fotsiny
Not even a face.	tsy tarehy akory
This does not seem to be the case.	toa tsy izany no zavamisy
This is a new day.	andro vaovao izao
You had a life.	nanana fiainana ianao
In part.	aminny ampahany iray
Don’t get me wrong about that.	aza diso hevitra momba izany
That’s really, really, everything in it.	izany no tena tena ny zavadrehetra ao aminy
Too often.	matetika loatra
Went the other way.	nandeha taminny lalana hafa
And part of it is ugly.	ary ny ampahany dia ratsy tarehy izy
Or you can do it.	na azonao atao izany
Such a journey is not possible today.	tsy azo atao ny dia toy izany ankehitriny
Make sure to check it out !.	ataovy azo antoka ny mijery
It’s really fun to watch games at night.	tena mahafinaritra ny mijery lalao aminny alina
So he had a really tough age.	noho izany dia nanana taona tena mafy izy
For others, it is not.	ho anny hafa dia tsy izany
Crazy for work.	adala noho ny asa
But this is the house for us.	fa ity no trano ho antsika
In fact, they don’t need us.	raha ny marina tsy mila antsika izy ireo
He already had you.	efa nanana anao izy
Either way, it’s a small thing.	na izany na tsy izany zavatra kely izany
It’s one of the best things about them.	iray aminireo zavatra tsara indrindra aminizy ireo izany
So that you can understand.	mba ho azonao
Because he is not the only one.	satria tsy izy ihany
There was money in it.	nisy vola tao
He has never seen me.	mbola tsy nahita ahy mihitsy izy
It is night and the bad days have come.	efa alina ny andro ary efa tonga ny andro ratsy
Sometimes it works.	indraindray izany dia miasa
The time is near.	fotoana akaiky izao
Just look at the story.	jereo fotsiny ny tantara
We have no other information.	tsy manana vaovao hafa izahay
Or still entirely for them.	na mbola ho azy ireo tanteraka
Of the good and the bad.	ny aminny tsara sy ny ratsy
Which is very appropriate.	izay tena mety
Then again, it doesn’t make sense.	avy eo indray tsy misy dikany izany
There will always be people working harder.	hisy foana ny olona miasa mafy kokoa
Of course they said no.	mazava ho azy fa hoy izy ireo hoe tsia
Not that bad, but it looks worse.	tsy ratsy toy izany fa toa ratsy kokoa
Maybe it wasn’t meant to be.	angamba tsy natao ho azy izany
He saw something there.	nahita zavatra teo izy
Maybe it needs more.	angamba mila bebe kokoa izany
They were happy to see us, but it was hard.	faly izy ireo nahita anay saingy sarotra izany
It might be too simple.	mety ho tsotra loatra izany
Both had.	samy nanana
But in general, there are two ideas.	misy hevitra roa anefa aminny ankapobeny
He did better.	nanao tsara kokoa izy
That's enough I said.	ampy izay hoy aho
He has done so before.	efa nanao toy izany izy taloha
They are all dead.	maty daholo
This is a good thing for almost everyone.	izany dia zavatra tsara ho anny saika ny rehetra
But the fun thing is often.	fa ny zavatra mahafinaritra matetika dia
This is very important for everyone.	tena zavadehibe ho anny rehetra izany
He is also great.	lehibe koa izy
Self and self, self and self.	ny tena sy ny tena ny tena sy ny tena
But everyone loved him.	tena tia azy anefa ny olona rehetra
He was lost without a car.	very tsy nanana fiara izy
People do that.	manao izany ny olona
If he knew.	raha fantany
We almost had it.	saika nanana azy izahay
There were two others.	nisy roa hafa
Make it the same place.	ataovy mitovy toerana
There are kind of similar things.	misy karazana zavatra mitovy aminizany
There really was no other way.	tena tsy nisy fomba hafa mihitsy
He said he was dead.	nilaza izy fa efa maty
So thank you again.	koa misaotra anao indray
It doesn’t seem to be doing anything.	toa tsy manao na inona na inona
She was nice to me at first.	tsara tamiko izy taminny voalohany
Too much in there.	be loatra ao
In a good and safe place.	ao aminny toerana tsara sy azo antoka
I know there is one below.	fantatro fa misy iray any ambany
There is no time now.	tsy misy fotoana izao
Thank you so much for being there for her.	misaotra betsaka fa teo ho azy
This is also the best time.	izany koa no fotoana tsara indrindra
No one has ever seen anything like it.	tsy mbola nisy olona nahita zavatra toy izao
You got it.	nahazo izany ianao
You know, it’s important.	fantatrao zavadehibe
But it has to start somewhere.	saingy tsy maintsy manomboka any ho any
Like something from a story.	toy ny zavatra avy aminny tantara iray
Make the best choice.	ataovy ny safidy tsara indrindra
He is very small.	kely dia kely izy
But yes, good work.	fa eny asa tsara
Everything is unnecessary.	ny zavadrehetra dia tsy ilaina
He is still not so happy.	mbola tsy faly toy izao izy
You get it from everywhere.	mahazo izany avy aminny toerana rehetra ianao
Not just now.	tsy vao izao
It's night.	alina izany
I shouldn’t be like that.	tsy tokony ho toy izany aho
But that doesn’t make sense to me now.	tsy misy dikany amiko anefa izany ankehitriny
No, he knows.	tsia fantany
Apparently this is a bad idea.	hita fa hevitra ratsy izany
Because the time will not come.	satria tsy ho tonga ny fotoana
A woman is a person.	ny vehivavy dia olona iray
He didn't look at anything.	tsy nijery na inona na inona izy
You have seen him do that.	efa nahita azy nanao izany ianao
The two worlds are completely different.	samy hafa tanteraka ny tontolo roa
But sometimes things go wrong.	misy zavatra tsy mety anefa indraindray
This trip is very close.	akaiky tokoa raha ity dia ity
They deserve more.	mendrika bebe kokoa izy ireo
There was something about it.	nisy zavatra taminizany
I see it coming.	hitako fa ho avy izany
It was easy to do.	mora ny nanao azy
The former is.	ny teo aloha no
Yes, there is.	eny misy izany
They are a little more than usual.	mihoatra kely noho ny mahazatra azy ireo
And the car went right away.	ary nandeha avy hatrany ilay fiara
They are the same.	mitovy ihany izy ireo
I knew he was happy.	fantatro fa faly izy
There’s really nothing you can’t do.	tena tsy misy zavatra tsy azonao atao
He had other ideas as well.	nanana hevitra hafa koa izy
He is his, and he is his.	azy izy ary azy koa izy
It seems so appropriate.	toa mety tokoa
I am always free.	afaka foana aho
And at the time it was really good.	ary taminizany fotoana izany dia tena tsara
This is not an immediate process.	tsy dingana iray eo noho eo izany
I don’t like women.	tsy tiako ny vehivavy
I hope you enjoyed it as much as we did.	manantena aho fa nahafinaritra anao toa anay
But that is not the future.	tsy ny ho avy anefa izany
We didn't have that at first.	tsy nanana izany izahay taminny voalohany
And so.	ary noho izany
He didn't look.	tsy nijery izy
It started bad.	nanomboka ratsy izany
Make it worth it.	ataovy mendrika izany
The woman was always wrong.	diso foana ilay vehivavy
I have never seen him do anything worse.	mbola tsy nahita azy nanao zavatra ratsy lavitra aho
There is something for everyone here.	misy zavatra ho anny rehetra eto
I have to do the same sometimes.	tsy maintsy manao izany koa aho indraindray
That’s the worst thing you can do.	izany no zavatra ratsy indrindra azonao atao
If not, they’re fine too.	raha tsy izy ireo dia tsara ihany koa
None of us liked him.	tsy nisy tia azy izahay
That and you can start earning money easily.	izany ary afaka manomboka mahazo vola mora foana ianao
One could be wrong.	mety ho diso ny iray
He had never seen anyone actually do that.	mbola tsy nahita olona tena nanao izany mihitsy izy
You looked good.	nijery tsara ianao
But it doesn’t seem to be.	saingy toa tsy izany
However, he told himself.	na izany aza dia nilaza taminny tenany izany izy
The idea hasn’t come yet.	mbola tsy tonga ny hevitra
You have done so much for me.	efa nanao zavatra betsaka ho ahy ianao
Everything seems easy.	toa mora ny zavadrehetra
It will not always be easy.	tsy ho mora foana izany
He was not crazy about money.	tsy adala taminny vola izy
There is nothing difficult about that.	tsy misy sarotra aminizany
So he doesn't do anything.	ka tsy manao na inona na inona izy
I think that’s a big step.	heveriko ho dingana lehibe izany
I have no problem with that stuff.	tsy manana olana aminizany zavatra izany aho
I think it was full.	heveriko fa feno ilay izy
Any time you want to come here.	aminny fotoana rehetra tianao ho tonga eto
It’s also about money.	izany koa dia momba ny vola
This idea is not correct.	tsy araka ny tokony ho izy io hevitra io
Then it goes a long way.	dia lasa lavitra
No one.	tsy misy olona
It may not be for them or for you.	tsy mety ho azy ireo na ho anao izany
A little harder.	somary sarotra kokoa
He seems to be right.	toa marina tokoa izy
But there is a problem.	saingy misy olana
Not good news at all.	tsy vaovao tsara mihitsy
We expect too much, really.	manantena be loatra izahay tena
Maybe he's dead now.	angamba efa maty izy izao
This will become a problem sooner or later.	ho lasa olana izany na ho ela na ho haingana
He went there and saw if he was there.	nandeha tany izy ary nijery raha tany izy
A little true.	marina kely
People or things that do not belong to him.	olona na zavatra tsy azy
Although the news is clear.	na dia mazava tsara aza ny vaovao
Of course, it is very simple.	mazava ho azy fa tena tsotra tokoa ilay izy
We don't need it anymore.	tsy mila izany intsony isika
It's not really that.	tsy tena izay ilay izy
I don’t know what kind.	tsy fantatro izay karazana
It has to be more than that.	tsy maintsy mihoatra noho izany
I should have been there.	tokony ho tany aho
I would have done the same thing.	ho nanao zavatra mitovy aminizany koa aho
Maybe they should.	angamba tokony ho izy ireo
She has .	izy dia manana
Very wrong idea.	tena diso hevitra
In a word, enough.	aminny teny iray ampy
But he never had it.	tsy nanana izany mihitsy anefa izy
Personal ideas will come and that’s a problem.	hevitra manokana no ho tonga ary olana izany
Unless anything else.	raha tsy hoe zavatra hafa
Something else is the same.	zavatra hafa mitovy
I know that too.	fantatro koa izany
You step.	dingana ianao
Really, don’t do that.	tena marina aza manao izany
However, this year everything is different.	na izany aza aminity taona ity dia hafa ny zavadrehetra
We are very small.	tena kely izahay
Not perfect at first.	tsy tanteraka taminny voalohany
However, there did not seem to be much work.	toa tsy nisy asa be anefa
He may not.	mety tsia izy
The world is not like that.	tsy mba toy izany izao tontolo izao
You have to do it.	tsy maintsy manao izany
Always new money.	vola vaovao foana
So that's okay.	ka mety izany
Make life fun.	ataovy mahafinaritra ny fiainana
He is human.	olona izy
Without it, we won’t do much either.	raha tsy misy izany dia tsy hanao zavatra betsaka koa isika
You did the worst.	nanao ny ratsy indrindra ianao
But what is more important.	fa inona no zavadehibe kokoa
We need both, and more of both.	mila azy roa isika ary bebe kokoa aminizy roa
It was nice to see him happy.	nahafinaritra ny nahita azy faly
He is mine.	ahy izy
There are a lot of games, and more to come soon.	misy lalao maro ary mbola ho avy tsy ho ela
About many things.	momba ny zavatra maro
I may be wrong.	mety ho diso hevitra aho
This place, this is the problem.	io toerana io io no olana
Here we work on.	eto dia miasa aminny
The battle is very fierce.	tena mafy ny ady
It may be difficult.	sarotra angamba ilay izy
They are simply crazy.	adala tsotra izao izy ireo
And if there are two, soon there will be three.	ary raha misy roa tsy ho ela dia hisy telo
You need to have it.	mila manana izany ianao
That’s how it starts.	toy izany no manomboka
I am so happy to have it.	tena faly aho manana izany
He’s a lot.	be dia be izy
It’s safer and faster.	azo antoka kokoa sy haingana kokoa izany
He looked around the house.	nijery manodidina ny trano izy
Someone is upstairs.	misy olona any ambony
The news is there and it works well.	ny vaovao dia ao ary miasa tsara
He did, and it was great.	nanao izany izy ary tena tsara
I said we start.	hoy aho hoe manomboka isika
I think it came from me.	heveriko fa avy amiko izany
They told the truth about you.	nilaza ny marina momba anao izy ireo
Still everything.	mbola ny zavadrehetra
It wasn't a big deal then.	tsy zavatra lehibe izany taminizany
I can't do that anymore.	tsy afaka manao izany intsony aho
I know that part of the story.	fantatro io ampahany aminny tantara io
And he still has them.	ary mbola manana azy ireo izy
And it’s all bad.	ary ratsy daholo izany
I enjoyed doing it.	nahafinaritra ahy ny nanao izany
But, you get all the way down here.	saingy tonga hatrany ambany eto ianao
The big picture doesn’t seem to matter anymore.	toa tsy zavadehibe intsony ilay sary lehibe
I said he did.	hoy aho hoe nanao izany izy
And then he had it.	ary avy eo dia nanana izany izy
There was already one.	efa nisy ny iray
Everything was the same.	toy ny teo ihany ny zavadrehetra
He expects nothing.	tsy manantena na inona na inona izy
We saw no other option.	tsy nahita safidy hafa izahay
Not often, but enough.	tsy matetika fa ampy
I think that could be for you too.	heveriko fa mety ho anao koa izany
He did nothing to her.	tsy nanao na inona na inona taminy izy
Maybe, one day.	mety ho indray andro any
They deserve it.	mendrika izany izy ireo
He loves it there.	tiany any
You can do a lot of things with them.	afaka manao zavatra betsaka miaraka aminizy ireo ianao
That is not the best idea.	tsy izany no hevitra tsara indrindra
I want him here.	tiako ho eto izy
He had thought the same thing.	efa nieritreritra zavatra mitovy aminizany koa izy
I know it’s hard to take the first step.	fantatro fa sarotra ny manao ny dingana voalohany
At the moment, that seems likely to be true.	aminizao fotoana izao dia toa mety ho marina izany
But what had to be done had to be done.	tsy maintsy natao anefa izay tsy maintsy natao
They are not the first.	tsy izy ireo no voalohany
He might be there.	mety ho any izy
Everything is perfect.	tsara tanteraka ny zavadrehetra
Easier said than done.	mora kokoa ny nieritreritra izany
He looked at it often.	nijery izany matetika izy
It’s harder to die.	mafy kokoa ny maty
Or when someone simply said.	na rehefa nisy nilaza tsotra izao
They did it.	izy ireo no nanao izany
We must walk this path alone.	tsy maintsy mandeha irery io lalana io isika
But there may be something a little more to it.	saingy mety hisy zavatra kely kokoa aminizany
Although not immediately.	na dia tsy avy hatrany aza
He found her beautiful.	nahita azy tsara tarehy izy
But that part doesn’t work.	saingy tsy mandeha io ampahany io
And the reality, of course, is very different.	ary ny zavamisy mazava ho azy dia tena hafa
And the story here is just fun.	ary ny tantara eto dia mahafinaritra fotsiny
There was no other way.	tsy nisy fomba hafa
It is real.	tena misy izy io
It’s all often the same.	mitovy matetika daholo izany
Of course, the overall picture here is not good.	mazava ho azy fa tsy tsara ny sary ankapobeny eto
You just have to be yourself, to be real.	tsy maintsy ho anao fotsiny ianao mba ho tena
Also check if the statement is not true.	jereo koa raha tsy marina ilay resaka
Despite the good work.	na dia eo aza ny asa tsara
You already have one.	efa manana iray ianao
I can't do anything about it.	tsy afaka manao na inona na inona momba izany aho
The two of us together, is more important than food.	ny anay roa miaraka dia zavadehibe kokoa noho ny sakafo
Nothing could be done.	tsy nisy zavatra azo natao
But we really love this thing.	fa tena tia anio zavatra io izahay
Almost no one does that now.	saika tsy misy manao izany ankehitriny
Nothing is worth it.	tsy misy mendrika izany
I know men.	fantatro ny lehilahy
But more than that.	saingy mihoatra noho izany
In the past it was the same.	taloha dia iray ihany izany
They just don’t deserve it.	tsy mendrika izany fotsiny izy ireo
Soon the big day came.	tsy ela dia tonga ny andro lehibe
Maybe others do.	angamba manao izany ny hafa
Then again, it might not be too bad.	avy eo indray mety tsy ho ratsy loatra izany
They had it too.	nanana izany koa izy ireo
As for the war, they have a great war to come.	raha ny momba ny ady dia manana ady lehibe ho avy izy ireo
The past is no longer the same.	ny fotoana aloha dia tsy mitovy intsony
If it’s easy, more people will do it.	raha mora ilay izy dia maro kokoa no hanao izany
She is a very good woman.	vehivavy tena tsara izy
I personally see it.	hitako manokana izany
All of this is easily understood.	izany rehetra izany dia mora azo
Too busy.	be atao loatra
Stupid idea, of course.	hevitra adala mazava ho azy
Then we drove.	dia nandeha fiara izahay
This is not the general result.	tsy izany no vokatra ankapobeny
No one has time to lose.	tsy misy manana fotoana ho very
He is going really well.	tena mandeha tsara izy
He never knew why.	tsy fantany mihitsy ny antony
It was hard to find the way.	sarotra ny nahita ny lalana
He’s having a great time.	manana fotoana lehibe izy
He was one of the best, best men.	izy dia iray aminireo tsara indrindra lehilahy tsara indrindra
They seem to fit.	toa mety izy ireo
Sometimes we fight big battles.	indraindray isika dia manao ady lehibe
You never really know.	tsy tena fantatrao mihitsy
But he saw her do it.	saingy nahita azy nanao izany izy
If the results are good it will be here.	raha tsara ny vokatra dia ho eto
Yes, the one.	eny ilay iray
Seeing nothing, he took another step.	tsy nahita na inona na inona izy dia nanao dingana hafa
Nothing was gained then.	tsy nisy na inona na inona azo taminizany
I will probably never know the full story.	tsy ho fantatro mihitsy angamba ny tantara feno
Maybe not even for long.	angamba tsy ho ela mihitsy aza
And now it's his.	ary ankehitriny izy dia azy
You already know that.	efa fantatrao izany
I did not see him.	tsy nahita azy aho
Now there was a story.	ankehitriny dia nisy tantara iray
Nothing was easy then.	tsy nisy zavatra mora taminizany
It was important to me to do that.	zavadehibe tamiko ny nanao izany
And he couldn't walk.	ary tsy afaka nandeha
Work still needs to be done.	mbola mila atao ny asa
They had nothing to lose.	tsy nanana na inona na inona ho very izy ireo
It’s big, beautiful, new and varied.	lehibe izy io tsara tarehy vaovao ary maro karazana
These three are mine.	ahy ireo telo ireo
It’s like a very busy time.	mitovy aminny fotoana tena be atao izany
I saw him right away.	hitako avy hatrany izy
I just needed something else, something else.	nila zavatra hafa fotsiny aho zavatra hafa
Maybe it won’t be too bad for them.	angamba tsy ho ratsy loatra ho azy ireo izany
Then all is well again.	dia tsara daholo indray
But then he stopped thinking about it.	tsy nieritreritra izany intsony anefa izy avy eo
We said for sure.	nilaza izahay fa azo antoka
Especially the past.	indrindra ny lasa
But there is a lot to it.	saingy misy zavatra be dia be ao
Or not looking the right way.	na tsy mijery ny lalana marina
It is now a private home.	trano manokana izy io ankehitriny
But it works for him.	mety aminy anefa izany
I know it’s not easy.	fantatro fa tsy tsotra izany
But the world is not the world.	fa izao tontolo izao dia tsy izao tontolo izao
And it's just wrong.	ary diso fotsiny izany
We are very similar.	mitovy be izahay
Too many of them.	be loatra aminizy ireo
Didn't see him.	tsy nahita azy
I really like it.	tena tiako ilay izy raha ny marina
It was a very crowded place.	tena toerana be olona ilay izy
It’s all one for him.	iray ho azy izany rehetra izany
He said he didn’t, but he could.	nilaza izy fa tsy nanao izany fa mety
It’s a full game.	lalao feno izany
They really looked where he was.	tena nijery ny toerana nisy azy izy ireo
And that’s a good idea.	ary hevitra tsara izany
It was hard when he did.	mafy mafy raha nanao izany izy
This is good news, too.	vaovao tsara koa izany
Many women do this.	vehivavy maro no manao izany
And that day finally came.	ary tonga ihany io andro io
He has everything here.	manana ny zavadrehetra eto izy
And that will be the highest here.	ary izany dia ho ambony indrindra eto
Expect the worst.	manantena ny ratsy indrindra
These stories are often very silly.	ireo tantara ireo matetika dia tena adala
Crazy game, actually.	lalao adala raha ny marina
I had the money.	nanana ny vola aho
No idea at all.	tsy misy hevitra mihitsy
Yes, it is a lot of work.	eny asa be izany
But that is not an option now.	tsy safidy anefa izany ankehitriny
I was always there.	teo foana aho
Now to do that thing.	ankehitriny mba hanao izany zavatra izany
I can't find any pictures for him.	tsy hitako izay sary ho azy
He really doesn’t know.	tena tsy fantany
Less movement.	kely kokoa ny hetsika
Our location is here.	ny toerana misy anay dia eto
The place is dead.	maty ilay toerana
The money will come to you.	ho avy aminao ny vola
That day will come quickly.	ho avy haingana izany andro izany

It's one o'clock.	aminny iray izao
They have the same idea.	mitovy hevitra ihany izy ireo
And that seems important.	ary toa zavadehibe izany
Sometimes this doesn’t work for some people.	indraindray dia tsy mety aminny olona sasany izany
I came to them.	tonga tany aminizy ireo aho
You were never with me.	tsy teo amiko mihitsy ianao
It's not too hard.	tsy dia sarotra loatra ilay izy
There were people on the ground.	nisy olona teo aminny tany
But what is this.	fa inona ity
For them, it’s not just a game.	ho azy ireo dia tsy lalao fotsiny izany
And then I came.	ary avy eo dia tonga aho
The truth is different.	hafa ny marina
People who don’t expect anything in particular don’t get anything in particular.	ny olona tsy manantena na inona na inona manokana dia tsy mahazo na inona na inona manokana
What’s worse.	inona no ratsy kokoa
He said he was not there.	nilaza izy fa tsy tao izy
You are not the only one who has lost someone.	tsy ianao irery no very olona
This is kind of.	karazana ity

You now have two options.	manana safidy roa ianao izao
It can be hard and difficult.	mety ho sarotra sy sarotra izany
But this is the first part of the problem.	saingy io no ampahany voalohany aminny olana
It’s not one of those things.	tsy iray aminireo zavatra ireo izany
But this is not the first time.	tsy vao voalohany anefa izao
But one cannot have everything.	saingy tsy afaka manana ny zavadrehetra ny iray
This was made very clear.	natao mazava tsara izany
Really lost history.	very tantara tokoa
It has come now.	tonga izany ankehitriny
She always loved him and never had a choice.	tia azy foana izy ary tsy nanana safidy mihitsy
You need to find something you know above.	mila mahita zavatra fantatrao eny ambony ianao
But now is a new time.	fotoana vaovao anefa izao

I think this is a big part.	heveriko fa ampahany lehibe ity
No one needs to see.	tsy misy mila mahita

But he wants more than that.	fa mihoatra noho izany no tiany
Best of all you like it.	ny tsara indrindra dia tianao izany
He can get more and more.	afaka mahazo bebe kokoa hatrany izy
The pictures are very good, the story is not bad either.	ny sary dia tena tsara ny tantara koa tsy ratsy

It should be a good day.	tokony ho andro tsara io

They became thinking.	lasa nieritreritra izy ireo
In the past life.	aminny fiainana taloha
It made good sense.	nisy dikany tsara izany
Thanks for the kind words.	misaotra taminny teny mahafinaritra

They don’t have a specific type.	tsy manana karazana manokana izy ireo

People can and do make themselves completely into this thing.	ny olona dia afaka ary manao ny tenany tanteraka aminity zavatra ity
Not everyone is the same.	tsy mitovy daholo ny olona
Yes, there was something there.	eny nisy zavatra tao
And they thought.	dia nieritreritra izy ireo
But hard work is not enough.	tsy ampy anefa ny asa mafy
Now these aren’t just good jobs.	ankehitriny dia tsy asa tsara fotsiny ireo
But he came alone.	tonga irery anefa izy
I love the need for it.	tiako ny mila azy
This place was great.	nahafinaritra io toerana io
No, he had thought about all that.	tsia efa nieritreritra izany rehetra izany izy
And they may not be wrong.	ary mety tsy ho diso izy ireo
For many, therefore.	ho anny maro noho izany
That is the reality for me.	izany no zavamisy amiko
And it could be even worse.	ary mety ho ratsy kokoa izany
Much worse for you.	tena ratsy kokoa ho anao
Then they became lovers of money.	dia lasa tia vola izy ireo
he is low.	ambany izy
He lost badly.	very ratsy izy
Then the earth was gone.	avy eo dia tsy nisy intsony ny tany
But it can be us.	mety ho antsika anefa izany
This is more important than ever.	zavadehibe kokoa noho ny teo aloha izany
But there had to be something.	saingy tsy maintsy nisy zavatra
But that doesn't always work.	tsy mandeha foana anefa izany
It's not far.	tsy lavitra io
But now he has not stopped.	tsy nijanona anefa izy izao
good I said.	tsara hoy aho
The idea is familiar from above.	ny hevitra dia mahazatra avy any ambony
But it is important.	zavadehibe anefa izany
And it all made sense.	ary nisy dikany daholo izany
This is the easiest thing to eat.	io no zavatra mora indrindra taminny sakafo
Not once, or once.	tsy indray mandeha na indray mandeha
Or maybe everyone was looking at me.	na angamba nijery ahy ny rehetra
This route goes in two directions.	ity lalana ity dia mandeha aminny lalana roa
Big is not enough, it has to be big.	tsy ampy ny lehibe tsy maintsy lehibe
The present is more than the past.	ny ankehitriny mihoatra ny lasa
You will soon know that this is the best way.	tsy ho ela dia fantatrao fa izany no fomba tsara indrindra
Because it doesn’t need him and he could be wrong.	satria tsy mila azy izany ary mety ho diso izy
Not that simple.	tsy hoe tsotra
If he is good.	raha tsara izy
They are beautiful.	tsara tarehy izy ireo
It works if you work.	miasa izany raha miasa ianao
Some are new.	ny sasany dia vaovao
He would have preferred it without her.	tiany kokoa ilay izy raha tsy nisy azy
You need to go there.	mila mandeha any ianao
But great results.	vokatra lehibe anefa
People come to my place.	tonga any aminny toerana misy ahy ny olona
Maybe that's better, he told himself.	tsara kokoa angamba izany hoy izy taminny tenany
There may be some truth to that.	misy marina angamba izany
It’s already very warlike here.	efa tena tia ady ny eto
It is too early for them.	mbola aloha loatra ho azy ireo izany
I have a big problem.	manana olana lehibe iray aho
And she is a woman.	ary vehivavy izy
He was very thoughtful.	tena nieritreritra be tokoa izy
So it is with them.	toy izany koa izy aminizy ireo
They just didn’t make sense at the time.	tsy nisy dikany fotsiny izy ireo taminizany fotoana izany
But no one said anything.	tsy nisy nilaza anefa
Here he sees me.	eto izy no mahita ahy
He can do it.	afaka manao izany izy
Probably okay.	mety ihany angamba
There is a war.	misy ady
This is not a clear process.	tsy dingana mazava izany
We should be closer to you.	tokony ho akaiky anao kokoa izahay
And a good thing, too.	ary zavatra tsara ihany koa
It’s not good either.	tsy tsara koa izany
There is no house at all.	tsy misy trano mihitsy
They are with you.	eo miaraka aminao izy ireo
Maybe that’s a bad idea.	hevitra ratsy angamba izany
He was alone there.	izy irery no tao
However, not at night.	na izany aza tsy aminny alina
It works for people.	miasa ho anny olona izany
But that is a long way off.	lavitra be anefa izany
It doesn’t seem far from them now.	toa tsy lavitra azy ireo izao
But if it’s big.	fa raha lehibe izany
In the picture.	ao aminny sary
I can do that a lot.	afaka manao izany betsaka aho
And about the future.	ary momba ny ho avy
And we can get more.	ary afaka mahazo bebe kokoa isika
You can't do it here.	tsy azonao atao eto
Very good fool.	tena tsara adala
You are completely wrong about that.	diso tanteraka ianao aminizany
There is only one life.	iray ihany ny fiainana
He didn’t want to lose her.	tsy tiany ny very azy
I think it needs a little more work.	heveriko fa mila asa kely kokoa izany
Then, that’s all.	avy eo dia ny rehetra
Today, you have to be big or special.	aminizao andro izao dia tokony ho lehibe ianao na manokana
You are very low, today.	tena ambany ianao aminizao andro izao
He soon had two jobs.	tsy ela dia nanana asa roa izy
He should be in his place.	tokony ho eo aminny toerana misy azy izy
You may be making a very bad choice.	mety hanao safidy ratsy be ianao
They couldn’t always look at him.	tsy afaka nijery azy foana izy ireo
I see it from here.	hitako avy eto izany
This is very wrong.	tena diso lalana izany
He didn't say anything.	tsy nilaza na inona na inona izy
Sometimes it takes a lot of time.	indraindray dia mila fotoana be izany
He has done it, once.	efa nanao izany izy indray mandeha
I couldn't go that way.	tsy afaka nandeha taminizany lalana izany aho
Everything looks good.	mijery tsara ny zavadrehetra
Especially if it looks like someone.	indrindra fa toa olona iray
But that is not possible, he said.	tsy azo atao anefa izany hoy izy
I don't like anyone anymore.	tsy tia olona intsony aho
They come naturally.	tonga ho azy izy ireo
To take the first step.	mba hanao ny dingana voalohany
The day was good and the people were fun.	tsara ny andro ary nahafinaritra ny olona
Thank you for a wonderful job.	misaotra anao taminny asa mahafinaritra
I didn’t enjoy it.	tsy nahafinaritra ahy izany
No problem whatsoever.	tsy misy olana na inona na inona
It will still be there.	dia mbola ho hita eo izany
It can’t be done well.	tsy azo atao tsara izany
But here is a problem.	misy olana anefa eto
I knew he wasn’t gone.	fantatro fa tsy lasa izy
I even had to be there.	tsy maintsy teo mihitsy aza aho
Take a look and see more.	jereo kely ary jereo bebe kokoa
It may seem difficult but it is very simple.	mety ho toa sarotra izany fa tena tsotra
However, they are very clear.	na izany aza dia mazava tsara izy ireo
He may never have known, they told him.	mety tsy ho fantany mihitsy izy hoy izy ireo taminy
They are like that.	toy izany izy ireo
Maybe they are crazy.	adala angamba izy ireo
That future is yours.	anao izany ho avy izany
Which is a very good idea too.	izay hevitra tena tsara koa
Because she is a woman.	satria vehivavy izy
This process is very simple.	ity dingana ity dia tena tsotra
You know what you get.	fantatrao izay azonao
But he didn't do much.	tsy nanao zavatra betsaka anefa izy
No problem at all.	tsy misy olana mihitsy
I thought it was a step.	nieritreritra aho fa dingana iray izany
The facts about all of us are true.	marina ny zavamisy momba antsika rehetra
I saw it coming, you know.	hitako ho tonga izany fantatrao
Even for him.	na ho azy aza
It doesn’t have to be for them.	tsy hoe tsy maintsy ho azy ireo izany
We will be at your location soon.	ho tonga tsy ho ela eo aminny toerana misy anao izahay
Please see the picture.	mba jereo ny sary
It looks like a woman.	toa vehivavy izany
Everything is so fast.	haingana dia haingana ny zavadrehetra
He got there.	tonga tany izy
I still do, of course.	mbola manao izany aho mazava ho azy
She is good for him.	tsara ho azy izy
These are the most common reasons.	ireo no antony mahazatra indrindra
It’s very different.	tena tsy mitovy izany
It is certainly easy to understand.	azo antoka fa mora azo izy io
He is the way.	izy no lalana
Nothing special.	tsy na inona na inona manokana
Good timing.	tsara ny fotoana
Either way, yours is right.	na izany na tsy izany marina ny anao
I find a place.	mahita toerana aho
Of course, this is not the case.	mazava ho azy anefa fa tsy izany no izy
Yours alone.	ny anao irery
It’s just like that.	toy izany ihany izy
I can't seem to do that anymore.	toa tsy afaka manao izany intsony
I think he really liked it.	heveriko fa tena tiany izany
Do good to everyone.	ataovy tsara ny olona rehetra
However, it is completely different.	na izany aza hafa tanteraka izany
There is a possibility of inaccuracies.	misy ny mety tsy marina
And here’s something else you need to know.	ary eto ny zavatra hafa tokony ho fantatrao
You are never stupid.	tsy adala mihitsy ianao
There may be enough people to do that.	mety ho ampy ny olona hanao izany
The reality is not the same.	tsy mitovy aminny marina ny zavamisy
There is no time.	tsy misy fotoana
They are still here.	mbola eto izy ireo
And he was glad he could do it.	ary faly izy afaka nanao izany
Then one day went by and another.	avy eo dia nandeha ny andro iray ary iray hafa
In a new place, alone.	ao aminny toerana vaovao irery
We have all seen it.	samy nahita izany isika rehetra
This is because they are simply not enough.	izany dia satria tsy ampy azy ireo fotsiny izy ireo
He has a way of words.	manana fomba aminny teny izy
They didn’t stop until they got me.	tsy nijanona izy ireo raha tsy nahazo ahy
Well, it is.	eny ary dia izao
You are still low.	mbola ambany ianao
He did see something.	nahita zavatra tokoa izy
There is nothing fancy in the food.	tsy misy zavatra mahafinaritra ao aminny sakafo
The night has come.	tonga ny alina
This guy was really nice.	tena nahafinaritra ity lehilahy ity
Something small, then something bigger, now.	zavatra kely avy eo zavatra lehibe kokoa izao
But then, maybe not.	fa avy eo angamba tsy
The future is very uncertain.	tena tsy azo antoka ny ho avy
Very good last meal.	sakafo farany tena tsara
But he works hard.	miasa mafy anefa izy
And there are many other reasons as well.	ary misy antony maro hafa koa
I need to be alone.	mila irery aho
So, make things easy, don’t make it hard.	noho izany ataovy mora ny zavatra aza atao sarotra
But some did not, they said.	misy anefa tsy nanao izany hoy izy ireo
He never liked it.	tsy tiany mihitsy izany
Because it’s not you.	satria tsy ianao izany
In the real world, these things are very different.	ao aminny tontolo tena izy dia tena samy hafa ireo zavatra ireo
They had it.	nanana izany izy ireo
The problem was no one saw it.	ny olana dia tsy nisy nahita azy
Of course, this is not true in general.	mazava ho azy fa tsy marina izany aminny ankapobeny
He knew it was not his.	fantany fa tsy azy ilay izy
There is no other reason.	tsy misy antony hafa
Overall, this problem seems complicated.	aminny ankapobeny toa sarotra io olana io
Just an idea is that.	hevitra fotsiny dia izay
The reason is simple.	tsotra ny antony
There are a lot of people now, and a lot of money.	betsaka ny olona ankehitriny ary betsaka ny vola
Don't get me wrong now.	aza diso aho izao
It’s very easy to see that.	tena mora ny mahita izany
Even one of these problems is enough.	na dia ny iray aminireo olana ireo dia ampy
Nothing was more important than the other.	tsy nisy zavadehibe kokoa noho ny iray hafa
The world was always watching him.	nijery azy foana izao tontolo izao
And when we come to the end.	ary rehefa tonga aminny farany isika
Not many things, but some things.	tsy zavatra maro fa zavatra sasany
They are only true once.	indray mandeha ihany izy ireo no marina
Sometimes the results are good.	indraindray dia tsara ny vokatra
We can't do them here.	tsy afaka manao azy ireo eto isika
They certainly did.	azo antoka fa nanao izany izy ireo
There was no war or time.	tsy nisy ady na fotoana
We weren't there yet.	mbola tsy teo izahay
In fact, it makes sense to me.	raha ny marina dia misy dikany amiko izany
This is where it starts.	eto no manomboka izany
But then he had to be selfish.	tsy maintsy tia tena anefa izy taminizany
It could not have happened.	tsy mety nisy
But even so, it doesn’t seem right.	saingy na izany aza dia toa tsy mety
And you know you don’t have that.	ary fantatrao fa tsy manana izany ianao
Not great, but good.	tsy lehibe fa tsara
They are both beautiful, happy.	samy tsara tarehy izy ireo faly
It has always been there.	efa nisy foana izany
Now there was.	ankehitriny dia nisy
Then again.	avy eo indray
I was really unhappy with him.	tena tsy faly taminy aho
We are something clear.	zavatra mazava isika
They were finally free.	afaka ihany izy ireo taminny farany
But that was not all.	tsy izay ihany anefa no tao
Otherwise, it makes no sense.	raha tsy izany dia tsy misy dikany izany
However, each day went as before.	na izany aza ny andro tsirairay dia nandeha toy ny teo aloha
Indeed, they should.	eny tokoa tokony ho izy ireo
That is where we are today.	izany no misy antsika aminizao fotoana izao
It both works.	samy miasa izy io
The fool is what he really wants to do.	ny adala no tena tiany atao
They should know.	tokony ho fantany
You may have done something wrong.	somary nanao ratsy angamba ianao
Or those like him.	na ireo toa azy
And it’s always the same.	ary mitovy foana izany
So this is the story.	dia izao no tantara
It was really bad at first.	tena ratsy izany taminny voalohany
I make good money.	mahazo vola tsara aho
But you will do better.	fa hanao zavatra tsara kokoa ianao
You can see this in the following way.	afaka mahita izany aminny fomba manaraka
He had many other options.	nanana safidy maro hafa izy
There they were thinking and thinking.	teo izy ireo nieritreritra sy nieritreritra
It works well and there are no problems.	miasa tsara izany ary tsy misy olana
It becomes too difficult.	lasa sarotra loatra izany
It has to be beautiful.	tokony ho tsara tarehy
And now, with this.	ary ankehitriny miaraka aminity
I'm not good enough.	tsy ampy aho
It’s all work.	asa daholo izany
What is, so.	inona no atao hoe ka
And for cars.	ary ho anny fiara
The first step is big in this game.	ny dingana voalohany dia lehibe aminity lalao ity
You had the money, and you don’t have it.	nanana ny vola ianao ary tsy manana izany
We are right there.	eo indrindra izahay
No, they are not.	tsia tsy izy ireo
I got the full story from him.	nahazo ny tantara feno taminy aho
Or in a place close to home.	na any aminny toerana akaiky ny trano
As usual, it’s not as obvious.	toy ny mahazatra dia tsy araka ny hita
So look at that.	ka jereo izany
That's the way it is.	izany no fomba
It won't be too long.	tsy ho ela loatra
It is also not possible at this time.	tsy azo atao koa aminizao fotoana izao
They saw it well.	nahita izany tsara izy ireo
But, of course, we are not meant to do that.	saingy mazava ho azy tsy natao hanao izany isika
I didn't find any news.	tsy nahita vaovao aho
He walks on his own.	mandeha ny tenany izy
But they could not think for themselves.	tsy afaka nieritreritra ny tenany anefa izy ireo
He was nearby.	teo akaiky teo izy
And that’s a big one.	ary izany dia lehibe iray
I had nothing left.	tsy nanana na inona na inona intsony aho
And it wasn’t there.	ary tsy teo izany
Maybe yours too.	ny anao koa angamba
In general, this is not much of a problem.	aminny ankapobeny dia tsy dia olana loatra izany
Everything always seems to be the case.	toa foana ny zavadrehetra
Maybe even happy.	faly aza angamba
You don’t deserve it.	tsy mendrika izany ianao
The results you get will certainly not be unusual.	azo antoka fa tsy ho mahazatra ny vokatra azonao
I think that's bad.	heveriko fa ratsy izany
I knew it would be hard for me.	fantatro fa ho sarotra amiko izany
Someone you will know.	olona ho fantatrao
For a man.	ho anny lehilahy iray
Everything you love and want in life, in one place.	ny zavatra rehetra tianao sy tianao aminny fiainana aminny toerana iray
You want to be like that, fine.	te ho toy izany ianao tsara
They went alone.	nandeha irery izy ireo
I know there could be a lot.	fantatro fa mety ho betsaka
But it may be different for women.	saingy mety ho hafa izany aminny vehivavy
The game went hard.	nandeha mafy ny lalao
That’s the easy part.	izany no ampahany mora
War is bad, and it is often worse.	ratsy ny ady ary matetika no ratsy kokoa izany
He even looked away.	nijery lavitra mihitsy aza izy
I might know.	mety ho fantatro
He will never do that now.	tsy hanao izany mihitsy izy izao
It seemed superior to me.	toa ambony tamiko izany
He did not think of himself.	tsy nieritreritra ny tenany izy
Nothing goes wrong and nothing is lost.	tsy misy mandeha ratsy ary tsy misy very
I enjoyed the game.	nahafinaritra ahy ilay lalao
Love it too.	tia koa
Still in it.	mbola ao anatiny
Ho ho ho.	ho ho ho
When you understand them well.	rehefa azonao tsara izy ireo
It could be that.	mety ho izay
There is something worse.	misy ratsy kokoa
No one always gets it right.	tsy misy mahazo azy tsara foana
That seems pretty clear.	toa mazava tsara izany
Yes, they work.	eny miasa izy ireo
They could have stayed longer if they wanted to.	mbola afaka nijanona ela kokoa izy ireo raha tiany
They could not do that.	tsy afaka nanao izany izy ireo
There was a war.	nisy ady natao
We are not sure.	tsy azo antoka izahay
In fact, war on war is not.	raha ny marina ny ady aminny ady dia tsy
But you said.	fa hoy ianao
It’s more appropriate.	mety kokoa izany
Now, look here.	ankehitriny jereo eto
But you have to go now.	saingy mila mandeha ianao izao
That’s all that should matter.	izay ihany no tokony ho zavadehibe
Two people were killed.	olona roa no maty
It was as if he really liked it.	toy ny hoe tiany be ilay izy
Yes, it works well for you.	eny miasa tsara ho anao izany
He didn’t want to lose for sure.	tsy te ho maty antoka izy
But the good news is.	vaovao tsara anefa
Sometimes there was nothing.	indraindray dia tsy nisy na inona na inona
But it was a great day everyone said.	saingy andro mahafinaritra izany hoy ny rehetra
It seems difficult and fun.	toa sarotra sy mahafinaritra
The top is the same as the bottom.	ny any ambony dia toy ny any ambany
Both words are true.	samy marina ireo teny ireo
But I love them.	tiako anefa izy ireo
The house started as usual.	nanomboka toy ny mahazatra ilay trano
They could be wrong.	mety ho diso izy ireo
A face was missing.	tsy teo ny tarehy iray
A quick question.	fanontaniana iray haingana
This is a good first step.	dingana voalohany tsara izany
Women love them too.	tia azy ireo koa ny vehivavy
Maybe that’s still true.	angamba mbola marina izany
So, there it is.	noho izany misy izany
I never said anything to him.	tsy nilaza na inona na inona taminy mihitsy aho
But these things are not always true.	saingy tsy marina aminny fotoana rehetra ireo zavatra ireo
I was happy there, very happy.	faly aho tany faly be
The dead are free.	afaka ny maty
I’m just that hard.	sarotra toy izany fotsiny aho
The truth is it’s not much fun.	ny marina dia tsy mahafinaritra lavitra
Both were fun.	samy nahafinaritra
These are good.	tsara ireo
It was a real battle.	tena ady tokoa ilay izy
Bigger, in fact.	lehibe kokoa raha ny marina
True, these things.	marina fa ireo zavatra ireo
Too much, you die.	be loatra maty ianao
So when you do something, do your best.	koa rehefa manao zavatra ianao dia ataovy izay tsara indrindra
A good time not to be wrong.	fotoana tsara tsy ho diso
Everything in a person is necessary.	ny zavatra rehetra ao aminny olona dia ilaina
Don’t look around.	aza mijery manodidina
It was too much for him.	be loatra ho azy izany
It was good to do that.	tsara ny nanao izany
However, it is still too early.	na izany aza dia mbola aloha loatra izany
No big stories.	tsy misy tantara lehibe
This work is important.	zavadehibe io asa io
Apparently we were very close before.	hita fa tena akaiky teo aloha izahay
Yes, there is.	eny misy azo
This is no longer true now.	tsy marina intsony izany ankehitriny
This man died beautifully.	ity lehilahy ity dia maty tsara tarehy
I don’t know about them.	tsy fantatro ny momba azy ireo
It seemed so easy.	toa mora be ilay izy
I have never seen it in his.	tsy mbola hitako tao aminny azy izany
It seems more important has been done.	toa ny zavadehibe kokoa natao
I hope you have a good day where you are.	manantena aho fa tsara ny andro any aminny misy anao
Or it could be the same.	na mety ho toy izany koa
Then he thought of something else.	nieritreritra zavatra hafa indray izy avy eo
Of course, he really goes for it.	mazava ho azy fa tena mandeha aminizany izy
Or both will.	na samy hanao
It doesn’t seem real.	toa tsy tena izy io
Not the same as before.	tsy toy ny teo aloha ihany
Well, maybe he doesn’t like it now.	eny angamba tsy tiany izany ankehitriny
He is acting very stupid.	manao adala be izy
For some, it is an option.	ho anny sasany dia safidy izany
Not the end.	tsy ny farany
And now, game time.	ary izao fotoana lalao
That’s what we’re used to.	izay no efa mahazatra anay
I said we do.	hoy aho hoe manao izany isika
The old way.	ny fomba taloha
We can do both.	afaka manao azy roa isika
In general, however.	aminny ankapobeny na izany aza
In fact, it already has.	raha ny marina dia efa nisy izany
I think that might be for some.	heveriko fa mety ho anny sasany izany
It’s one of the best things.	iray aminireo zavatra tsara indrindra izany
Nothing much was found.	tsy dia nisy zavatra hita
Yes, if you are not too old.	eny raha tsy ela loatra ianao
They love you.	tia anao izy ireo
It seems to have to be different.	toa tsy maintsy hafa ihany izany
They really aren’t there.	tena tsy eo izy ireo
But there was a problem.	nisy olana anefa
These are the most important ones.	ireo no tena zavadehibe
Others will not.	ny hafa tsy hanao izany
It has happened before.	efa nisy izany taloha
This part of it.	ity ampahany aminy ity
There are these places.	misy ireo toerana ireo
They finally arrived.	tonga ihany izy ireo
You will get it.	ho azonao izany
The usual meaning.	ny dikany mahazatra
If you had an idea.	raha nanana hevitra ianao
But nothing seems to be going on.	saingy toa tsy misy mandeha
The work is more enjoyable.	mahafinaritra kokoa ny asa
I think that’s all.	heveriko fa izany no zavadrehetra
Because it is ours.	satria antsika izany
He was also very nice.	tena nahafinaritra koa izy
Nobody does that at all.	tsy misy olona manao izany mihitsy
Today's war is different.	hafa ny ady ankehitriny
I had never thought of much more than that.	tsy mbola nieritreritra be mihoatra noho izany akory
It’s already a bit unusual.	efa somary tsy mahazatra izany
Maybe a little of both.	angamba kely aminizy roa
He said he has some.	nilaza izy fa manana ny sasany
I think we need that first.	heveriko fa mila izany aloha isika
Nothing special at all.	tsy misy zavatra manokana mihitsy
But such a person is wrong.	diso anefa ny olona toy izany
Just something else.	zavatra hafa ihany
But still nothing.	saingy mbola tsy misy
Not always true.	tsy marina foana
And you will get it, you will always get it.	ary ho azonao izany ho azonao foana
He made that choice.	izy no nanao izany safidy izany
That is the last important thing.	izany no zavadehibe farany
It will never be enough.	tsy ho ampy mihitsy izany
It all works now.	miasa daholo izao
If he did, fine.	raha nanao izany izy dia tsara
Not even me.	tsy amiko akory
But it went really well.	saingy nandeha tsara tokoa izany
He's around here somewhere.	manodidina eto izy any ho any
It’s always me.	amiko foana io
In general, this fact will not be important.	aminny ankapobeny dia tsy ho zavadehibe io zavamisy io
And that’s too little.	ary kely loatra izany
But that doesn’t make much sense.	tsy dia misy dikany loatra anefa izany
It seems normal, in fact.	toa mahazatra raha ny marina
But the news is too little and too familiar.	fa ny vaovao dia kely loatra sy mahazatra loatra
But he knew this was unusual.	fantany anefa fa tsy mahazatra izany
Maybe he didn’t tell me.	angamba tsy nilaza tamiko izy
We don’t deserve it.	tsy mendrika izany izahay
Wherever they were.	izay rehetra nisy azy ireo
To be himself again.	ny ho tenany indray
And then two.	ary avy eo roa
The very thing that is really me.	ny tena izay tena ahy
No travel with women.	tsy misy dia miaraka aminny vehivavy
Life in general.	ny fiainana aminny ankapobeny
We don’t have that anymore.	tsy manana izany intsony isika
We are better off.	tsara kokoa isika
There are not many.	tsy misy maro
Whatever it is, they are certainly old enough.	na inona na inona izany dia azo antoka fa efa ampy taona izy ireo
That is if not all of them.	izany dia raha tsy izy rehetra
Yes, they were both there.	eny samy tao izy roa
They are all good.	tsara daholo izy ireo
It doesn’t work all the time of course.	tsy mandeha aminny fotoana rehetra mazava ho azy
And he said no, no.	ary hoy izy hoe tsia tsia
There seemed to be no end to the road.	toa tsy nisy farany ny lalana
It was good to watch him.	tsara ny nijery azy
Some seem fun.	toa mahafinaritra ny sasany
And maybe.	ary mety
No one can do that for you.	tsy misy afaka manao izany ho anao
Yes, that could be good.	eny mety ho tsara izany
It's all very good.	tena tsara daholo
He has no idea.	tsy manana hevitra izy
Some of them will be good for you.	ny sasany aminizy ireo dia ho tsara ho anao
But then he went.	nandeha ihany anefa izy avy eo
It won't be long.	tsy ho ela izany
Nothing is more important than that.	tsy misy zavadehibe kokoa noho izany
But there may be two other reasons.	mety misy antony roa hafa anefa
And yet, it doesn’t.	ary na izany aza tsy manao izany
I was with him.	teo aminy aho
But here.	fa eto
It doesn’t go very long.	tsy mandeha ela be izany
And if that were the case, it would never be so.	ary raha izany no izy dia tsy ho toy izany mihitsy
He knows it now.	fantany izany izao
It doesn’t seem like much of a debate.	toa tsy ady hevitra loatra izany
Nor is it a trivial matter.	tsy resaka tsy misy dikany koa izany
She was like a dead woman.	toy ny vehivavy maty izy
It’s part of you.	ampahany aminao izany
It was so close.	tena akaiky tokoa ilay izy
Even the pictures are not enough.	na ny sary aza tsy ampy
But he knew that he might be wrong.	fantany anefa fa diso angamba izy
However, this is another problem.	na izany aza olana hafa izany
It doesn’t seem like too hard a job.	tsy hoe toa asa sarotra loatra izany
We don’t need them here.	tsy mila azy ireo eto izahay
I disagree with you.	tsy mitovy hevitra aminao aho
They are all around us.	manodidina antsika izy ireo
But he didn't.	saingy tsy nanana izy
Not only that, though in part.	tsy izany ihany na dia ampahany aza izany
They also said no.	nilaza koa izy ireo hoe tsia
Other times it is not.	aminny fotoana hafa dia tsy izany
It’s a really great place.	tena toerana lehibe izany
Really fun, fast, fun.	tena mahafinaritra haingana mahafinaritra
We want to do it well.	te hanao izany tsara izahay
For some, it’s too hard, too hard.	ho anny sasany dia mafy loatra izany mafy loatra
Apparently not too much of a problem.	hita fa tsy misy olana loatra
Maybe not for you, but for me.	mety tsy ho anao fa ho ahy
That’s an idea.	hevitra iray izany
They were not far away but still around.	tsy lavitra izy ireo fa mbola teo aminny manodidina
I can't see.	tsy mahita aho
There has never been a time like this.	tsy mbola nisy toy izany ny fotoana
The world is his.	azy izao tontolo izao
Everything is small really.	kely ny zavatra rehetra tena
But it is very clear.	mazava be anefa izany
Here's what you don't know.	ity ny zavatra tsy fantatrao
A special place.	toerana iray manokana
We played a good game.	nanao lalao tsara izahay
There was something else there.	nisy zavatra hafa koa teo
We are the only ones at the top.	isika ihany no any ambony
I think you can do it well.	heveriko fa azonao atao tsara izy
It seemed like a lot of work.	toa asa be ilay izy
But he did, and here we are.	nanao izany anefa izy ka eto isika
He is very different.	hafa mihitsy izy
And there is always news.	ary misy vaovao foana
This is better than before.	tsara kokoa noho ny teo aloha izany
In general, this option is irrelevant.	aminny ankapobeny dia tsy misy dikany io safidy io
For him now.	ho azy izao
But it’s more difficult when you have all the facts.	sarotra kokoa anefa izany rehefa manana ny zavamisy rehetra ianao
But over time, the.	saingy rehefa mandeha ny fotoana ny
I really don’t like him.	tena tsy tiako izy
This one could not be any different.	ity iray ity dia tsy mety ho hafa intsony
Better than that.	tsara kokoa noho izany izany
It’s not that hard to get.	tsy dia sarotra ny mahazo azy
But one thing he knew.	fa zavatra iray no fantany
But it is not the same.	tsy mitovy anefa izany
This is someone close to us.	olona akaiky anay io
At first nothing else was found.	taminny voalohany dia tsy nisy zavatra hafa hita
Whatever it is.	na inona na inona izany
Or you can do anything.	na afaka manao na inona na inona
Such is the idea.	toy izany ny hevitra
It has to work for us.	tsy maintsy miasa ho antsika izany
Up and up.	ambony sy ambony
This is good.	tsara izao
No, he thought.	tsia hoy izy nieritreritra
Didn't see it.	tsy nahita izany
Because we are one.	satria iray isika
It will surely come to pass.	azo antoka fa ho tanteraka izany
He is not like her.	tsy mitovy aminy izy
So you have to do something else.	noho izany dia tsy maintsy manao zavatra hafa ianao
Then time becomes an issue.	dia lasa olana ny fotoana
It is not an option for us.	tsy safidy ho anay izany
It’s definitely one of them.	tena azo antoka fa iray aminizy ireo izany
It’s easy to see that.	mora ny mahita izany
It is also a question of opinion.	fanontaniana hevitra ihany koa izany
And he did something.	dia nanao zavatra izy
You wouldn’t have existed.	tsy ho nisy ianao
But there was nothing, nothing.	saingy tsy nisy na inona na inona na inona na inona
But this is absolutely true.	marina tanteraka anefa izany
We couldn’t have had a better time.	tsy afaka nanana fotoana tsara kokoa izahay
He wants to be seen.	te ho hita izy
Things you already know and some you don’t know.	zavatra efa fantatrao ary ny sasany tsy fantatrao
It won't be long now.	tsy ho ela izao
Especially now.	indrindra izao
Now they seem to be doing it.	ankehitriny dia toa manao izany izy ireo
The very last, to me, is the least common.	ny tena farany amiko ny kely indrindra mahazatra
The same goes for the other two.	toy izany koa ny roa hafa
I enjoyed drawing him.	nahafinaritra ahy ny nanao sary azy
It's too early.	mbola aloha loatra
It was a very simple thing.	tena zavatra tsotra tokoa ilay izy
These people did something important, all of them.	nanao zavadehibe ireo olona ireo izy rehetra
We stayed two nights.	nijanona roa alina izahay
Always gone.	lasa foana
But he had to do what he wanted.	nila nanao izay tiany anefa izy
Because of you.	noho ny aminao
But that is not enough for him.	tsy ampy azy anefa izany
He really lost his reason.	tena very antony izy
That's exactly what happened then.	izany mihitsy no nisy taminizany
And then he’s all around me.	ary avy eo izy dia manodidina ahy
If they don’t love you, they don’t love you.	raha tsy tia anao izy ireo dia tsy tia anao
I really deserve it.	mendrika izany tokoa aho
He never seemed to see her.	toa tsy nahita azy mihitsy izy
Not too far.	tsy dia lavitra
Everything is for two now.	ny zavadrehetra ho anny roa izao
This has been around for a long time.	efa ela no nisy izany
That was the most fun.	izany no tena nahafinaritra
Just do it right.	ataovy marina fotsiny
The game is very similar.	ny lalao dia tena mitovy
And of course that’s good for me.	ary mazava ho azy fa tsara amiko izany
Then he became one of those same things.	dia lasa iray aminireo zavatra ireo ihany izy
You follow them, they follow you.	manaraka azy ireo ianao manaraka anao izy ireo
It will be completely different in this world.	ho hafa tanteraka aminity izao tontolo izao ity
It’s a good choice.	safidy tsara izany
It really should be.	tena tokony ho izany
Then he left too.	dia lasa koa izy
They are absolutely full.	tena feno tanteraka izy ireo
It’s finally over.	farany izany
Thanks, but not for me.	misaotra fa tsy ho ahy
I'm not dead yet.	mbola tsy maty aho
I always thought it was, or about him.	heveriko foana fa izy io na momba azy
But I like that approach.	tiako izany fomba izany anefa
This is life as it should be.	izany no fiainana araka ny tokony ho izy
Things in this world can be good.	mety ho tsara ny zavatra eto aminity tontolo ity
And just like that, we went.	ary toy izany ihany nandeha izahay
They have no problem.	tsy manana olana izy ireo
This fact makes no sense.	tsy misy dikany izany zavamisy izany
Maybe, maybe not.	angamba mety tsy
You are doing a good job.	manao asa tsara ianao
He had good news.	nanana vaovao tsara izy
But then we stopped.	nijanona anefa izahay avy eo
This story alone is not good.	ity tantara ity ihany no tsy tsara
And then you die.	ary avy eo dia maty ianao
Nothing was lost.	tsy nisy very
But, the results will be worth it.	saingy ho mendrika ny vokatra
But you are very wrong.	tena diso hevitra anefa ianao
Which was really fun.	izay tena nahafinaritra tokoa
It was real, and it was real.	tena nisy ilay izy ary tena nisy
He will come alone.	ho avy irery izy
I said nothing else.	tsy nilaza zavatra hafa aho
Life is simple but people are not like that.	tsotra ny fiainana fa tsy toy izany ny olona
Another good man did it.	nisy lehilahy tsara iray hafa nanao izany
This is exactly where we should be.	izany indrindra no toerana tokony hisy antsika
No, certainly not for long.	tsia azo antoka fa tsy ho ela
But worse is yet to come.	mbola ratsy kokoa anefa no ho avy
That was what was important to me.	izany no zavadehibe tamiko
They are so stupid.	tena adala izy ireo
The first did not go far.	tsy lasa lavitra intsony ilay voalohany
But sometimes you can do something for me.	afaka manao zavatra iray ho ahy anefa ianao indraindray
Three days is enough.	telo andro dia ampy
But it is also dead.	fa maty koa izy io
And it’s not easy.	ary tsy mora izany
We do it for him.	manao izany ho azy isika
You didn’t stop.	tsy nijanona ianao
But it is not enough.	tsy ampy anefa
Good for him, therefore.	ny tsara ho azy noho izany
He was in an unknown land.	tany aminny tany tsy fantany izy
Everyone will make way for you now.	hanao lalana ho anao izao ny rehetra
But in the end, he got his.	nahazo ny azy anefa izy taminny farany
Of course, this can be difficult.	mazava ho azy fa mety ho sarotra izany
I hope all is well with it.	manantena aho fa tsara ny zavadrehetra miaraka aminy
Maybe even a lot.	mety betsaka aza
I haven't done that yet.	tsy mbola nanao izany aho
It started again.	nanomboka indray izany
But that will never happen.	tsy ho tanteraka mihitsy anefa izany
He saw me and stopped.	nahita ahy izy ka nijanona
Everyone will be great.	ho lehibe ny rehetra
I'm glad you're gone.	faly aho fa lasa ianao
There is no real here.	tsy misy tena eto
Time is a factor.	antony iray ny fotoana
It’s so simple that it becomes difficult.	tsotra loatra ka lasa sarotra
It had been a long time since there had been a word.	efa ela no tsy nisy teny
Now the method is easier than before.	ankehitriny ny fomba dia mora kokoa noho ny teo aloha
Others do not.	ny hafa tsy manao izany
Anyway, it's been a long time.	na izany na tsy izany efa ela izay
The busiest time.	ny fotoana be atao indrindra
If not, you may already have them.	raha tsy izany dia mety efa manana azy ireo ianao
Or both.	na ho samy
This works well with two people.	izany dia miasa tsara aminny olona roa
It is very necessary.	tena ilaina tokoa
You already know about them.	efa fantatrao ny momba azy ireo
If you are not sure.	raha tsy azonao antoka
And a little more.	ary kely kokoa
In the end, it didn’t make sense.	taminny farany dia tsy nisy dikany izany
One is the old one.	ny iray dia ilay taloha
There is a lot of bad and a lot of good.	be ny ratsy sy be ny tsara
We had a great time then.	nanana fotoana nahafinaritra be izahay taminizany
In general, not too many.	aminny ankapobeny dia tsy dia maro loatra
You were glad you had fun.	faly ianao fa nahafinaritra
Not a lot of money.	tsy vola be
Anything simple should be best.	na inona na inona tsotra dia tokony ho tsara indrindra
There is not much you can do about it.	tsy betsaka ny azonao atao momba izany
I like to start early.	tiako ny manomboka aloha
He doesn't like me anymore.	tsy tiany intsony aho
We lost nothing.	tsy nisy very na inona na inona izahay
There is only one thing I want you to know.	zavatra iray ihany no tiako ho fantatrao
So that’s a problem.	ka olana izany
He became free.	lasa afaka izy
Not too many people could say that.	tsy dia betsaka loatra ny olona afaka nilaza izany
It doesn’t go alone.	tsy mandeha irery izy io
You are more important.	zavadehibe kokoa ianao
It has to be the same.	tsy maintsy ho toy ny iray ihany koa
Everything was never good.	tsy nisy tsara mihitsy ny zavadrehetra
That’s the problem, he knows.	izany no olana fantany
First in one way and then another.	voalohany aminny lalana iray avy eo aminny iray hafa
Then do it again.	dia manao izany indray
But that's good.	fa izay no tsara
This is a completely different matter.	resaka hafa mihitsy ity
And it’s certainly not a bad thing.	ary azo antoka fa tsy ratsy izany
Of course, the car was empty.	mazava ho azy fa foana ilay fiara
It’s like you can see from the inside.	toy ny hoe afaka mijery avy ao anatiny
Although possible.	na dia mety
But that is far from the truth.	saingy lavitra izany ny zavamisy
And some people got it.	ary nahazo izany ny olona sasany
For us it is.	ho antsika dia izay
That’s something you need to know.	zavatra tokony ho fantatrao izany
Of course, this is not a bad thing.	mazava ho azy fa tsy zavatra ratsy izany
And he looked.	dia nijery izy
But now he knows he is more than that.	saingy fantany izao fa mihoatra noho izany izy
They saw no one.	tsy nahita olona izy ireo
Bad for many reasons.	ratsy noho ny antony maro
But it also doesn't make sense.	tsy misy dikany koa anefa izany
But not all the news is good.	tsy tsara daholo anefa ny vaovao
Everyone was very happy.	faly be ny rehetra
He is even smaller now.	mbola kely kokoa izy izao
This is true in this world.	marina izany eto aminity tontolo ity
We stopped not far from the road.	nijanona tsy lavitra ny lalana izahay
He said it was the wrong question.	nilaza izy fa fanontaniana diso izany
Here it is not.	eto dia tsy izany
They are a fun part of you.	ampahany mahafinaritra anao izy ireo
And he couldn't do it.	ary tsy afaka nanao izany izy
You are the old man.	ianao ilay olona taloha
And maybe he did.	ary angamba nanao izany izy
It was very fun for people who loved it.	tena nahafinaritra ny olona tia azy io
We finally went.	nandeha ihany izahay
And he still does.	ary mbola manao izany izy
About that, though.	momba izany na izany aza
That time will come again.	ho avy indray izany fotoana izany
Maybe all three.	angamba izy telo ireo
Don’t do that about him.	aza manao izany momba azy
You will not do that.	tsy hanao izany ianao
There is really not enough space here.	tena tsy ampy ny toerana eto
We must all love him.	tsy maintsy tia azy isika rehetra
He has never had it.	mbola tsy nahazo izany mihitsy izy
Some said yes.	hoy ny sasany hoe eny
You can, and should, follow.	afaka ary tokony manaraka
This year, nothing.	aminity taona ity tsy misy na inona na inona
It doesn’t work for others.	tsy mety aminny hafa izany
If you don’t like it, it’s bad.	raha tsy tianao izany dia ratsy izany
And about that.	ary momba izany
And not always with me.	ary tsy miaraka amiko foana
The best.	ny tsara indrindra
It’s not like he’s alone.	tsy toy ny hoe irery izy
All ideas are in one place.	any aminny toerana iray ny hevitra rehetra
And he doesn’t.	ary tsy manao izany izy
There’s a need but it’s not something, it certainly isn’t.	misy ny ilaina fa tsy zavatra izany azo antoka fa tsy
I love him then.	tiako izy ary
But they won’t go far now.	saingy tsy ho lasa lavitra izy ireo izao
And well worth it.	ary mendrika tokoa
I will do something else.	hanao zavatra hafa aho
I want to do it again soon.	te hanao anio indray aho tsy ho ela
Anyway, this woman.	na izany na tsy izany ity vehivavy ity
But, thanks to both.	saingy misaotra ny roa
But the other men didn't seem to care.	toa tsy nisy dikany taminy anefa ny lehilahy hafa
I saw him, one night.	hitako izy indray alina
Sometimes even better.	indraindray aza tsara kokoa
We exist.	misy isika
Some just died.	nisy maty fotsiny
We are glad to be there.	faly izahay fa ao
Of course, the latter is the hardest to achieve.	mazava ho azy fa ny farany no sarotra indrindra azo
He was just misplaced.	diso toerana fotsiny izy
Certainly not tonight.	azo antoka fa tsy anio alina
It comes too easy.	tonga mora loatra izany
It also makes sense.	misy dikany koa izany
The two are not together.	izy roa no tsy miaraka
There’s a really cool idea.	misy hevitra tena mahafinaritra
The place is great.	tena tsara ilay toerana
Finally he said he would do it.	farany dia nilaza izy fa hanao izany
That’s good, but not enough.	tsara izany saingy tsy ampy
Not only is it fun but it’s endless fun.	tsy mahafinaritra fotsiny fa mahafinaritra tsy misy farany
I had the most time of anyone.	nahazo fotoana betsaka indrindra taminny olona rehetra aho
Maybe he would have been better off without it.	angamba ho tsara kokoa izy raha tsy nisy izany
It might be good.	mety tsara
What with something else and something else.	inona aminny zavatra hafa sy zavatra iray
Yes, not in the game though.	eny tsy aminny lalao na izany aza
It’s a fun time.	fotoana mahafinaritra azy
I watched him die.	nijery azy maty aho
Either way, there is still a lot to be done.	na izany na tsy izany dia mbola betsaka ny azo atao
This is possible for two reasons.	mety izany noho ny antony roa
You can't do what you want here.	tsy afaka manao izay tianao eto ianao
Some, but not all.	ny sasany fa tsy ny rehetra
They don’t do anything for you, unlike you.	tsy manao na inona na inona ho anao izy ireo tsy toa anao
I came to that.	tonga aminizany aho
I need a little.	mila kely aho
There seemed to be nothing.	toa tsy nisy na inona na inona
Then he could see for himself.	dia afaka nahita ny tenany izy
Not that it always goes.	tsy hoe mandeha foana
They are both right and both wrong.	samy marina izy ireo ary samy diso
And they got it too.	ary nahazo izany koa izy ireo
In more places.	aminny toerana maro kokoa
Like this.	toa izao
I think that's a misconception.	heveriko fa diso hevitra izany
He was just such a man.	lehilahy toy izany ihany izy
This is a new game.	lalao vaovao io
That is a lot of money.	izany hoe vola be
I can't do anything anymore.	tsy afaka manao na inona na inona intsony aho
I already love you.	efa tia anao aho
That’s a fun thing to do.	zavatra mahafinaritra izany
Yes or no.	eny na tsia
He is always busy.	be atao foana izy
One might be right for you.	mety tsara aminao ny iray
I am a decent woman.	vehivavy mendrika aho
This was not a good time for me.	tsy fotoana tsara tamiko izany
He does everything.	izy no manao ny zavadrehetra
It doesn’t really matter.	tsy dia zavadehibe loatra
I always had that.	nanana izany foana aho
If he didn’t see it, it would never be real.	raha tsy nahita izy dia tsy ho tena izy mihitsy
Of course you get it.	mazava ho azy fa azonao
And often they are.	ary matetika izy ireo
Thank you so much to everyone.	misaotra betsaka aminny rehetra
We all do at once.	indray mandeha tokoa isika rehetra
But there has to be a better way.	saingy tsy maintsy misy fomba tsara kokoa
Women will always be women.	ny vehivavy dia ho vehivavy foana
But do it.	fa ataovy izany
I'm confused by this.	very hevitra aho aminity
It’s a different job but it is.	asa hafa io fa izy io
He will not do such a thing.	tsy hanao zavatra toy izany izy
The story seemed to come easily.	toa tonga mora ilay tantara
I still have two issues.	mbola manana olana roa aho
He didn’t want to do anything to me.	tsy te hanao na inona na inona amiko izy
Yes, he is for sure.	eny azo antoka izy
They will be lost one by one.	ho very tsirairay izy ireo
So, it’s definitely safe.	noho izany dia azo antoka fa azo antoka
The same is true for others.	toy izany koa ho anny hafa
You're glad you're here.	faly ianao fa eto
And looked at him too.	ary nijery azy koa
You are so wrong about me.	diso be ianao momba ahy
Only the present is important.	ny ankehitriny ihany no zavadehibe
This product is solid.	mafy io vokatra io
It all seems lost.	toa very daholo
They really needed money.	tena nila vola izy ireo
They weren’t very fun.	tsy dia nahafinaritra loatra izy ireo
Someone died that day.	nisy olona maty taminizany andro izany
But he couldn’t think of a good enough story.	saingy tsy afaka nieritreritra tantara ampy tsara izy
And look there.	ary jereo eo
And it is certainly true.	ary marina tokoa izany
I think this is the least you can do.	heveriko fa io no kely indrindra azonao atao
No reason.	tsy antony
First, what not.	voalohany inona no tsy
They have to come.	tsy maintsy tonga izy ireo
I think this is the last time.	heveriko fa izao no fotoana farany
Maybe it’s better, maybe worse.	angamba tsara kokoa izany angamba ratsy kokoa
Made it really simple for me.	nanao izany ho tena tsotra ho ahy
I am really alone here.	tena irery aho eto
They don’t exist.	tsy misy izy ireo
He looked but did not see.	nijery izy fa tsy nahita
And it could be easier.	ary mety ho mora kokoa izany
The people they used to be.	ny olona izay nisy azy ireo taloha
He has you.	manana anao izy
We women are free.	afaka isika vehivavy
That is enough for each of us.	ampy ho antsika tsirairay izany
I want to know.	tiako ho fantany
I love all of mine with it all.	tiako ny ahy rehetra miaraka aminy rehetra
I see that you are.	hitako fa ianao
It’s only for two.	ho anny roa ihany izany
I still have it.	mbola manana izany
But it is not as easy as it seems.	tsy mora araka ny hita anefa izany
There are a lot of results.	betsaka ny vokatra azo
Of course, the house should be bigger.	mazava ho azy fa tokony ho lehibe kokoa ny trano
He didn't say anything to her about it.	tsy nilaza na inona na inona taminy momba izany izy
I will have a hard time with him.	hanao fotoana mafy miaraka aminy aho
But it could be anything.	mety ho na inona na inona anefa izany
We couldn’t have come to a better place for me.	tsy afaka tonga taminny toerana tsara kokoa ho ahy izahay
This is important to the world.	zavadehibe aminizao tontolo izao izany
Not as often, of course.	tsy toy ny matetika mazava ho azy
They were good to him.	tsara taminy izy ireo
But now he seems to be.	toa izy anefa izao
They come and go.	tonga izy ireo ary mandeha
Other, but none more than the above.	hafa fa tsy misy mihoatra ny ambony
It was fun to watch.	nahafinaritra ny nijery azy
It would be worse for me.	ho ratsy kokoa amiko izany
Some not so much.	ny sasany tsy dia be loatra
The conversation is always yours.	anao foana ny resaka
But this is the right path.	fa io no lalana mety
Already loved the little one.	efa tia ilay kely
And he still loves her.	ary mbola tiany izy
Otherwise, no problem.	raha tsy izany dia tsy misy olana
It doesn’t seem like a big deal.	toy ny tsy zavatra lehibe izany
But it’s not a fun job.	saingy tsy asa mahafinaritra izany
But one fact is clear.	misy zavamisy iray mazava anefa
Worse than the process.	ratsy noho ny dingana
It seemed completely different.	toa hafa tanteraka ilay izy
We look at something like never before.	mijery zavatra tsy mbola nisy toy izany izahay
He said you would know.	nilaza izy fa ho fantatrao
Here time is meaningless.	eto dia tsy misy dikany ny fotoana
What are the primary reasons for.	inona avy ireo antony voalohany aminny
He enjoyed it now.	nahafinaritra azy izany izao
Almost there! 	saika any
They come and they come, they come and they come.	tonga izy ireo ary tonga izy ireo tonga izy ireo dia tonga hatrany
You are all wrong about this.	diso hevitra izany rehetra izany ianao
Everything is fast.	haingana ny zavadrehetra
So it’s fun.	ka mahafinaritra izany
And they are no more.	ary tsy misy intsony izy ireo
But not everything is good.	saingy tsy tsara ny zavadrehetra
There are many, many things, that can do this.	misy zavatra maro maro afaka manao izany
I have a little question here.	manana fanontaniana kely aho eto
It finally came.	tonga ihany io
Everything is already in it.	efa misy ny zavatra rehetra ao anatiny
We did a really good job.	nanao asa tena tsara izahay
This one is very different.	hafa mihitsy ity iray ity
You know why.	fantatrao ny antony
It is something from within itself.	zavatra avy ao anatiny ny tenany
However, some steps may be impossible.	mety ho foana anefa ny dingana sasany
They don’t want to be wrong.	tsy te ho diso izy ireo
And it was really fun.	ary tena nahafinaritra
She was very happy to see him.	tena faly izy nahita azy
I find it very difficult.	hitako fa sarotra be izany
Nothing could have been better done.	tsy nisy zavatra tsara kokoa natao
And, he never comes up with the news.	ary tsy dia tonga aminny vaovao mihitsy izy
But he must have known it best, he knew it.	tsy maintsy ho fantany tsara indrindra anefa izy fantany izany
These words were meaningless.	tsy nisy dikany ireo teny ireo
He is full of self.	feno tena izy
There must be something missing from me.	tsy maintsy misy zavatra tsy ampy ahy
I think it just stayed with me.	heveriko fa nijanona tamiko ihany ilay izy
But nothing like this has ever happened to me.	tsy mbola nisy toy izany tamiko anefa izany
Yes, you are beautiful.	eny tsara tarehy ianao
He knew what was coming for him.	fantany izay ho avy ho azy
They are not one and the same.	tsy iray ary iray ihany izy roa
But sometimes we do.	saingy indraindray isika dia manao izany
We are better at it.	isika no tsara kokoa aminizany
She is so fun to draw !.	tena mahafinaritra ny manao sary izy
I know better now.	fantatro tsara kokoa izao
Nearby.	eo akaiky eo
You enjoyed the food.	nahafinaritra anao ny sakafo
It was very difficult.	tena sarotra be ilay izy
But it’s starting to get too much for him.	saingy manomboka lasa be loatra aminy izany
But it is also important in life.	tena ilaina koa anefa izany eo aminny fiainana
That seems wrong.	toa diso izany
Every time is different.	samy hafa ny fotoana rehetra
Thank you for telling me.	misaotra anao nilaza tamiko
Usually everything works fine.	matetika ny zavadrehetra dia miasa tsara
But that no longer made sense.	tsy nisy dikany intsony anefa izany
But now it is gone.	fa izao dia lasa
The battle here will be fierce.	ho mafy ny ady eto
The results can be great.	mety ho lehibe ny vokatra
The lower the better.	ny ambany dia tsara kokoa
No other woman had it.	tsy nisy vehivavy hafa nanana izany
Everything is fine, here.	tsara ny zavadrehetra eto
I never got a word from him.	tsy mba nahazo teny taminy mihitsy aho
But he had to go.	tsy maintsy nandeha anefa izy
We’ve had enough.	efa ampy tsara izahay
I don’t need to look at anything.	tsy mila mijery na inona na inona aho
Yes, he was there.	eny teo izy
It might work.	mety miasa izany
He was a simpler person.	olona tsotra kokoa izy
The last one was two years ago.	ny farany dia roa taona lasa izay
We have always been there.	efa nisy foana izahay
There is no wrong way.	tsy misy fomba ratsy
He looked at me hard.	nijery ahy mafy izy
He knows what he wants and what he wants.	fantany izay tiany sy izay tiany
I’m kind of lost here.	somary very aho eto
He’s the only one that matters.	izy ihany no zavadehibe
We are together.	miaraka isika
But he doesn't want to do it again.	tsy te hanao izany indray anefa izy
Maybe someone is better.	mety misy olona tsara kokoa
It is very important to me.	tena ilaina amiko izany
We have to do it for them.	tsy maintsy manao izany ho azy ireo isika
I won’t be there !.	tsy ho teo aho
I really want him to be happy.	tena tiako izy ho faly
Well, that’s a little bit.	eny ary kely izany
I love this life, and the same people around me.	tiako ity fiainana ity ary olona mitovy aminny manodidina ahy
It will also be easier.	ho mora kokoa koa izany
He loves good stories.	tia tantara tsara izy
No other results are possible.	tsy misy vokatra hafa azo atao
And many seem worse than that.	ary maro no toa ratsy kokoa noho izany
Because that's what it is.	satria izay no izy
I should never have gone to see him.	tsy tokony nandeha nijery azy mihitsy aho
In this case .	raha izany dia
Very happy with this product.	tena faly aminity vokatra ity
Not going well.	tsy mandeha tsara
He’s a nice guy, you know.	lehilahy mahafinaritra izy fantatrao
We are simple.	tsotra izahay
Many of them are also simple.	tsotra ihany koa ny maro aminizy ireo
All of this seems absolutely true.	toa marina tanteraka izany rehetra izany
You know you don’t need him anymore.	fantatrao fa tsy mila azy intsony ianao
You don't love me anymore.	tsy tia ahy intsony ianao
I have never seen anything like it.	mbola tsy nahita toy izany mihitsy aho
So a small house.	ka trano kely
He’s also working on something.	izy koa dia miasa aminny zavatra iray
There will be good, there will be bad.	hisy ny tsara hisy ny ratsy
There were no problems at all.	tsy nisy olana mihitsy
In fact, it is.	raha ny tena izy dia dia
This is for free women.	izany dia ho anny vehivavy afaka
Check it out today.	jereo eto anio
No one does that.	tsy misy manao toy izany
This is also important.	zavadehibe koa izany
A man is a man.	lehilahy dia lehilahy
Yes, it is very simple.	eny tena tsotra izany
But not from this.	fa tsy avy aminity
And they were right in the end.	ary marina izy ireo taminny farany
For him, it started like any other day.	ho azy dia nanomboka toy ny andro rehetra izany
See all previous issues here.	jereo eto ny olana teo aloha rehetra
With that again.	miaraka aminizany indray
There are no results in the end.	tsy misy vokatra aminny farany
What is right.	inona no mety
Another year without him.	taona hafa tsy nisy azy
You got yours.	nahazo ny anao ianao
It didn’t exist and never will.	tsy nisy izany ary tsy hisy mihitsy
Start a new life.	manomboka fiainana vaovao
No, no, that's wrong.	tsia tsia diso izany
Almost immediately it was night.	saika teo no ho eo dia alina ny andro
He was able to get it.	afaka nahazo izany izy
Then get what you want.	dia mahazo izay tianao
It seems so too.	toa izao koa
Which you know to be true.	izay fantatrao fa marina
They both had the truth.	samy nanana ny marina izy ireo
This will be important next time.	izany dia ho zavadehibe aminny manaraka
I had no other place.	tsy nanana toerana hafa aho
The previous one is now wrong.	diso izao ilay teo aloha
The first reason is time.	ny antony voalohany dia ny fotoana
It’s another step and it’s a little smaller.	dingana iray hafa ary kely kokoa izany
We had the most wonderful day.	nanana andro nahafinaritra indrindra izahay
There was a hard time in him now.	nisy mafy tao aminy ankehitriny
They came too fast.	tonga haingana loatra izy ireo
We had.	dia nanana
She was around him.	tao aminny manodidina azy izy
The pictures were great.	nahafinaritra ny sary
The real problem is much bigger than that.	ny tena olana dia lehibe lavitra noho izany
People are following this story.	manaraka ity tantara ity ny olona
I know the usual.	fantatro ny mahazatra
It’s all still there.	mbola ao daholo izany
But it has only just begun.	saingy vao nanomboka izany
Easy and simple.	mora sy tsotra
Apparently, they are very much in agreement.	hita fa tena mitovy hevitra izy ireo
It might be a little easy, that is.	mety ho mora kely izany izay
Some new and some old.	ny sasany vaovao ary ny sasany taloha
However, he already knew.	na izany aza efa fantany ihany
The same is true of employment issues.	toy izany koa ny olana momba ny asa
It’s certainly not a very difficult process.	azo antoka fa fomba tsy dia sarotra loatra izany
Not there at all.	tsy any intsony mihitsy
Everyone has their love.	samy manana izay tia azy ny tsirairay
It seems so silly that it can’t be done.	toa adala loatra izany ka tsy azo atao
It’s a close game.	lalao akaiky izany
You know this one is coming.	fantatrao fa ho avy ity iray ity
Unless he always saw her.	raha tsy hoe nahita azy foana izy
The stupid fool.	ny adala adala
But it still didn’t make sense.	saingy mbola tsy nisy dikany izany
We are all on a journey.	isika rehetra dia miaraka aminny dia
They often do not come.	matetika izy ireo no tsy tonga
But it could be better.	mety ho tsara kokoa anefa izany
Both don’t work.	samy tsy miasa izy roa
He had already told me that.	efa nilaza izany tamiko izy
He didn’t like any of them.	tsy tiany na dia iray aza
It was just a conversation.	resaka fotsiny no tena nisy
From then on it was simple.	manomboka aminizany dia tsotra
This is especially true today.	tena marina izany ankehitriny
But they couldn’t do one thing you could have done.	saingy tsy afaka nanao ny zavatra iray azonao atao izy ireo
But there will be something in each.	fa hisy zavatra ao aminny tsirairay
Sometimes he isn’t.	indraindray dia tsy izy
Maybe it wouldn’t have happened.	angamba tsy ho nisy izany
This is the problem I think.	io no olana heveriko
I have a different life than before.	manana fiainana hafa noho ny taloha aho
And for obvious reasons.	ary noho ny antony mazava
Apparently, the two are not very different.	hita fa tsy hafa be izy roa
Either way, here’s the most important thing you need to know.	na izany na tsy izany ity ny zavadehibe tokony ho fantatrao
It might be stupid it might not be.	mety ho adala mety tsy ho
And something else.	ary zavatra hafa
It is very safe indeed.	tena azo antoka tokoa izany
He wants you to do the same.	tiany hanao izany koa ianao
Had it.	nanana izany
It was more pleasant to see him there.	nahafinaritra kokoa ny nahita azy tao
It shouldn’t be difficult.	tsy tokony ho sarotra izany
It went easy.	nandeha mora izany
There seemed to be no way inside.	toa tsy nisy lalana tao anatiny
Good is not easy.	tsy mora ny tsara
Nothing can be done about it.	tsy misy azo atao aminizany
It’s really hard now.	tena mafy izao
I look away.	mijery lavitra aho
Some days are better than others.	ny andro sasany dia tsara noho ny sasany
Of course.	mazava ho azy
So it is in.	noho izany dia ao aminny
And hard days.	ary andro sarotra
There is a place for everything.	misy toerana ny zavadrehetra
He has a hard time walking.	sarotra be izy mandeha
You may have a time issue.	mety manana olana momba ny fotoana ianao
Too many people do that.	be loatra ny olona manao izany
Some are right, some are wrong.	misy marina misy diso
I would be very happy about that.	ho faly tanteraka aho taminizany
But it was there.	teo anefa izany
Not of any of these.	tsy anny iray aminireo
I didn’t do anything to deserve it.	tsy nanao na inona na inona mba mendrika izany aho
Immediately the question began.	avy hatrany dia nanomboka ny fanontaniana
They may be lost in familiar places.	mety ho very any aminny toerana mahazatra izy ireo
The car is good for all of us.	tsara ho antsika rehetra ny fiara
But now someone told him there was a problem.	saingy izao dia nisy nilaza taminy fa misy olana
I will not be there.	tsy ho any aho
And we’re not as usual.	ary tsy toy ny mahazatra izahay
He might even be good.	mety ho tsara mihitsy aza izy
I have a better job now.	manana asa tsara kokoa aho izao
Some already had.	ny sasany efa nanana
Some people are too close to themselves.	misy olona akaiky loatra ny tenany
And that was the most important thing to me.	ary izany no zavadehibe indrindra tamiko
But of course it was for me.	fa mazava ho azy fa ho ahy izany
He has no way at all.	tsy manana fomba mihitsy izy
It will not be difficult to do so.	tsy ho sarotra ny nanao izany
No, that's right.	tsia marina izany
But it can happen.	mety hisy anefa izany
Not too fast.	tsy dia haingana loatra
They don’t do that anymore.	tsy manao izany intsony izy ireo
Then it becomes ugly.	dia lasa ratsy tarehy
Not for me.	tsy ho ahy
This is the biggest story.	izany no tantara lehibe indrindra
But it can't be done again.	saingy tsy afaka indray izany
If there is one.	raha misy iray
In fact, it’s crazy.	raha ny marina dia adala izany
This is, simply, an impossible task.	izany dia tsotra fotsiny asa tsy azo atao
There are a lot of honest and hardworking people there.	betsaka ny olona manao ny marina sy miasa mafy any
It’s not something that’s done hard at all.	tsy zavatra natao sarotra na inona na inona izany
I have to.	tsy maintsy izany aho
Of course, that’s too much.	mazava ho azy fa be loatra izany
You were the only one not there.	ianao ihany no tsy teo
Maybe both of them.	angamba izy roa ireo
Just look at the picture and you will get it.	jereo fotsiny ny sary dia ho azonao
I am not alone in this.	tsy irery aho aminizany
This one really means a lot to me.	tena misy dikany amiko ity iray ity
You really like them.	tena tianao izy ireo
He seemed far away from her again.	toa lavitra azy indray izy
But that would be pointless.	tsy hisy dikany anefa izany
It should be like that, but it’s not.	tokony ho toy izany fa tsy izany

There was and there is a reason for it.	nisy ary misy antony izany

I don't see any.	tsy mahita na iray aza
The weather is very bad.	ratsy be ny andro
It didn’t look like it was really fun.	tsy hita ilay izy fa tena nahafinaritra

It was fun to say that.	nahafinaritra ny nilaza izany
But that's all for now.	fa izay ihany aloha izao
And they are almost right.	ary saika marina izy ireo
This was the worst part of the night.	ity no ampahany ratsy indrindra aminny alina
Wrong wrong wrong.	diso diso diso

What works for you may not work for others.	izay mety aminao dia mety tsy mety aminny hafa

Which is not really possible.	izay tsy tena azo atao
And because he needed a little of himself.	ary satria nila ny tenany kely izy

However, it is still a difficult task.	na izany aza dia mbola asa sarotra
Something but kind of a difficult word.	zavatra iray fa karazana teny sarotra
It is not.	tsy izy io
He’s really good even now.	tena tsara tokoa izy na dia izao aza
But this is the best.	fa ity no tsara indrindra
This is not a pretty picture.	tsy sary tsara tarehy io
Some people are not very special when.	misy olona tsy tena manokana rehefa
It was on the same day.	taminny andro iray ihany io

It is us.	isika io
In fact, it doesn’t make sense.	raha ny marina tsy misy dikany izany
But, there is a question.	saingy misy fanontaniana iray
This is a good word.	izao no teny tsara
Yes, it's not too far here.	eny tsy dia lavitra loatra ny eto
I told the truth.	nilaza ny marina aho
So much for all of us.	be dia be ho antsika rehetra
It’s well worth it for me.	tena mendrika ho ahy izany
If you want, you can come too.	raha tianao dia afaka tonga koa ianao
Of course he liked it.	mazava ho azy fa tiany izany

They found one quickly.	nahita iray haingana izy ireo
Ours is not.	ny anay tsy izany

Without it, they have nothing.	raha tsy misy izany dia tsy manana na inona na inona izy ireo
I will not come.	tsy ho avy aho
You can watch it here.	afaka mijery azy eto ianao
I could go, he thought.	afaka nandeha aho hoy izy nieritreritra
Another, that is.	iray hafa izany hoe
But we were very happy with her.	faly be taminy anefa izahay
And yes, that’s good.	dia eny tsara izany
That’s the kind of man.	izany no karazana lehilahy
But everything else works fine.	fa ny hafa rehetra dia miasa tsara
But now it all makes perfect sense.	saingy izao dia misy dikany tanteraka izany rehetra izany
It's small.	kely izy io
You never know it.	tsy fantatrao mihitsy izany
I knew it was going to be a big deal.	fantatro fa ho zavatra lehibe izany
He doesn’t like it either.	tsy tiany koa
It was really fun to see.	tena nahafinaritra ny nahita
It’s not mine, he said.	tsy ahy izany hoy izy
It is perfect.	izy io dia tanteraka
They are not mine.	tsy ahy izy ireo
It was too far away.	lavitra loatra ilay izy
I knew he would lose his reason.	fantatro fa ho very antony izy
But the picture is twofold.	fa ny sary dia roa
We are in very different places.	any aminny toerana tena samy hafa isika
It was really bad for me.	tena ratsy tamiko izany
Something is missing from me, of course.	misy zavatra tsy ampy ahy mazava ho azy
I looked at you too.	nijery anao koa aho
It always needs to be done.	mila atao foana izany
In fact, it seems like a trivial idea.	raha ny marina dia toa hevitra tsy misy dikany izany
So there must be another way.	noho izany dia tsy maintsy misy fomba hafa
It’s not like it’s just from here.	tsy toy ny hoe avy eto fotsiny
There are big events coming up.	misy hetsika lehibe ho avy
And it’s not bad to watch them either.	ary tsy ratsy koa ny mijery azy ireo
This method is a complex and complicated method.	ity fomba ity dia fomba sarotra sy sarotra
You can do it, but do it.	azonao atao izany fa ataovy izany
Of course, that wouldn’t make sense.	mazava ho azy fa tsy hisy dikany izany
You just thought you should know.	nieritreritra fotsiny ianao fa tokony ho fantatrao
This one is easy.	ity iray ity dia mora
He was my first.	izy no voalohany ahy
They went again.	nandeha indray izy ireo
Probably none of them.	mety tsy misy aminizy ireo
You are right about the road.	marina ny anao momba ny lalana
But it works like this.	fa miasa toy izao
There was one thing.	nisy zavatra iray
Yes, almost everything.	eny saika ny zavatra rehetra
He is always good.	tsara foana izy
Otherwise.	raha tsy izany
Sometimes he is just not selfish.	tsy tia tena fotsiny izy indraindray
He did.	izy no nanao
I will know.	ho fantatro
I was completely confused.	very hevitra tanteraka aho
Not like me or you.	tsy toa ahy na ianao
Now, right away.	ankehitriny eo no ho eo
But everything is bad.	ratsy anefa ny zavadrehetra
They had never done that before.	mbola tsy nanao izany izy ireo taloha
But it was too fast.	saingy haingana loatra izany
But they do not need them.	tsy mila azy ireo anefa izy ireo
They are often different facts.	matetika izy ireo dia zavamisy tsy mitovy
But already.	fa efa
This is because it really works.	izany dia satria tena miasa
Sometimes, it’s the same one day.	indraindray toy izany koa ny andro iray
Or a lot of things, for that matter.	na zavatra be dia be aminizany
It’s not hard to find one.	tsy sarotra ny mahita iray
This is done in a simple way.	izany dia atao aminny fomba tsotra
They are busy.	be atao izy ireo
Maybe he had one somewhere.	angamba izy nanana iray tany ho any
This method is almost better.	saika tsara kokoa izany fomba izany
Just look around.	jereo fotsiny ny manodidina
It was a wonderful day.	andro nahafinaritra izany
And that seems to be true now.	ary toa marina izany ankehitriny
I don’t have to do that.	tsy mila manao izany aho
That was the first thing done.	izany no zavatra voalohany natao
There is also none.	tsy misy koa izany
No, no, they said.	tsia tsy misy hoy izy ireo
It might be good one day.	mety tsara indray andro any
They don’t look.	tsy mijery izy ireo
This is because anything is possible.	izany dia satria azo atao ny zavatra rehetra
However, this is not the full picture.	na izany aza tsy ity ny sary feno
Do what you want to do.	ataovy izay tianao atao
Two other cars were inside, but not all cars.	fiara roa hafa no tao anatiny fa tsy fiara rehetra
If only that, that's all.	raha izay ihany dia izay ihany
He looks better.	toa tsara kokoa izy
See the full part here.	jereo eto ny ampahany feno
Years of things.	taona ny zavatra
And nothing fancy.	ary tsy nisy zavatra tsara tarehy
He knows that house, or those like him.	fantany io trano io na ireo toa azy
I have to look at that word.	tsy maintsy mijery anio teny io aho
Yes, the good old days.	eny ny andro tsara taloha
There is no other world, but this will do.	tsy misy izao tontolo izao hafa fa ity no hanao
The man seemed a little confused.	toa very hevitra kely ilay lehilahy
It won’t make sense.	tsy hisy dikany izany
I always thought about him.	nieritreritra momba azy foana aho
When we go, there will be no more.	rehefa mandeha izahay dia tsy hisy intsony
You must already know all of this.	tsy maintsy efa fantatrao izany rehetra izany
But he may not have done so.	mety tsy ho nanao izany anefa izy
Just an old thing.	zavatra taloha ihany
Work is work.	asa dia asa
Of course, you still don’t get it.	mazava ho azy fa mbola tsy azonao izany
I am very good.	tena tsara aho
Yes, it is still real life.	eny mbola tena fiainana izany
No one has seen it yet.	tsy mbola nisy nahita
It was all new to him.	vaovao taminy daholo izany
We had thought about everything.	efa nieritreritra ny zavadrehetra izahay
I have to go see him.	tsy maintsy mandeha mijery azy aho
Great people.	olona lehibe
But this is not for us.	tsy natao ho antsika anefa izany
Or the food.	na koa ny sakafo
Too many cars.	fiara be loatra
He started, he stopped.	nanomboka izy dia nijanona
I love these people.	tiako ireo olona ireo
But that idea is too fast.	haingana loatra anefa izany hevitra izany
But she could be a beautiful woman.	mety ho vehivavy tsara tarehy anefa izy
Starting now for next year.	manomboka izao ho anny taona manaraka
And don’t look down.	ary aza mijery ambany
And the latter is my favorite.	ary ny farany no tiako indrindra
And now he knows what he is.	ary ankehitriny dia fantany hoe inona izy
It seems to come from everywhere.	toa avy eny rehetra eny
Everything is possible if you arrive early.	azo atao ny zavadrehetra raha tonga aloha ianao
Not around you at all.	tsy manodidina anao mihitsy
But he goes because he wants to.	mandeha anefa izy satria te hanao izany
But no.	fa tsy misy
And that is nothing but the truth.	ary tsy inona izany fa ny marina
There is no way around it.	tsy misy lalana manodidina izany
I think you know that.	heveriko fa fantatrao izany
Please talk.	mba resaka
So, it takes a long time.	noho izany dia mila fotoana ela
One sees.	ny iray mahita
But I have a problem.	manana olana iray anefa aho
I know you can do it.	fantatro fa azonao atao izany
Always, found him best.	efa foana nahita azy tsara indrindra
For them, meaning is important.	ho azy ireo dia zavadehibe ny dikany
Of course, this is not always the case.	mazava ho azy fa tsy izany foana
But that question is not here.	tsy eto anefa io fanontaniana io
He doesn’t have enough facts.	tsy ampy ny zavamisy izy
He will not be wrong.	tsy ho diso izy
Without the process, there is not enough time.	raha tsy misy ny dingana dia tsy ampy ny fotoana
It could only be for the better.	mety ho aminny tsara ihany izany
The same one.	ilay iray ihany
You love him.	tianao izy
There were no parts.	tsy nisy ampahany
They may not always be there.	mety tsy eo foana izy ireo
It’s a bit difficult.	somary sarotra
More than fun, that is.	mihoatra noho ny mahafinaritra izany
However, many people disagree with me.	na izany aza maro ny olona tsy mitovy hevitra amiko
I was not in the right place.	tsy teo aminny toerana tsara aho
He could not tell.	tsy afaka nilaza izy
He didn’t want her to love him.	tsy tiany ho tia azy izy
Fun, for sure.	nahafinaritra azo antoka
First, it’s hard all the time.	voalohany sarotra ny fotoana rehetra
Not a pretty face but not a bad face either.	tsy tarehy tsara tarehy fa tsy ratsy tarehy koa
Or in place.	na aminny toerana
He will be gone.	ho lasa izy
What I love becomes love, and words go with words.	ny tiako dia lasa tia ary ny teny dia mandeha aminny teny
He knows a lot about history.	fantany tsara ny momba ny tantara
Expect results first.	manantena ny vokatra aloha
But there are two problems with that.	misy olana roa anefa aminizany
Well, we can’t do much about this one.	eny tsy afaka manao zavatra betsaka momba ity iray ity isika
It really works.	tena mandeha tokoa izany
It had to be done.	tsy maintsy natao izany
But this is also not entirely true.	tsy marina tanteraka koa anefa izany
They will not go away.	tsy ho lasa izy ireo
A lot of work.	asa be
They seem to have it all.	toa manana izany rehetra izany izy ireo
Some big and some small.	ny sasany lehibe ary ny sasany kely
It’s not the same for you.	tsy mitovy aminao izany
And you might be next.	ary mety ho ianao no manaraka
So there is for you.	koa misy ho anao
It seems to be going well.	toa mandeha tsara izany
There were other and higher options.	nisy safidy hafa sy ambony kokoa
I might need one.	mety mila iray aho
It’s from people like you.	avy aminny olona toa anao izany
If you don’t have one, you have to check it out.	raha tsy manana ianao dia tsy maintsy mijery izany
These are my favorites.	ireo no tiako indrindra

We are both like that.	samy toy izany izahay
You can’t make a big time.	tsy afaka manao ny fotoana lehibe ianao
He must have gone crazy.	tsy maintsy ho lasa adala izy
It meant something to all of us.	nisy dikany ho antsika rehetra izany
You alone are the last.	ianao irery no farany
They are all gone.	efa lasa daholo izy rehetra
People are not with him.	tsy miaraka aminy ny olona
Here is a picture of him.	ity misy sary misy azy
That's enough, you know.	ampy izay fantatrao
Do it almost correctly.	manao izany saika araka ny tokony ho izy
Which, in fact, you can’t.	izay raha ny marina dia tsy afaka
That's all he has.	izay ihany no azy
They acted foolishly.	nanao adala izy ireo
We are not human.	tsy hoe olona isika
But it’s a big deal.	saingy zavatra lehibe izany
I’ve been everywhere.	efa tany aminny toerana rehetra aho
Finally, there is the question of other options.	farany misy ny fanontaniana momba ny safidy hafa
But not with me.	tsy miaraka amiko anefa
He loved the night.	tiany ny alina
It could be even more than that.	mety mbola mihoatra noho izany aza izany
Just a little farther.	lavitra kely fotsiny
Someone you know or know.	olona fantatrao na fantatrao
I’ve seen it up close.	efa hitako akaiky
But it looks very different.	saingy toa hafa mihitsy izany
There may be a choice you can make.	mety misy safidy azonao atao
That doesn’t seem to be the case to me.	toa tsy izany no zavamisy amiko
The situation is not the same today.	tsy mitovy ny zavamisy ankehitriny

The lowest.	ny farany ambany indrindra

They eventually went too far, so he left.	lasa lavitra loatra izy ireo taminny farany ka lasa izy
But he doesn’t.	saingy tsy manao izany izy
I just don’t see anything.	tsy mahita na inona na inona fotsiny aho
It’s not the same, he said.	tsy mitovy aminy izany hoy izy
He didn’t have it well.	tsy nanana izany tsara izy
You love life.	tia fiainana ianao
It’s really not that hard to get them.	tena tsy dia sarotra ny mahazo azy ireo
But the reality is more complicated.	saingy sarotra kokoa ny zavamisy

Very happy.	tena faly indrindra
I thought about everything.	nieritreritra ny zavadrehetra aho

But it is also true that.	marina koa anefa fa
And it was a big day.	ary andro lehibe izany

More than I really love him.	mihoatra noho ny tena tia azy
It’s all just a game.	lalao fotsiny izany rehetra izany

Maybe something was lost.	angamba nisy very
So they had more than enough.	noho izany dia nanana mihoatra noho ny ampy izy ireo
It was just a lot of work.	asa be fotsiny ilay izy
I will not be alone.	tsy ho irery aho
May be incomplete.	mety tsy feno
Do it one day.	manao indray andro
I love the way, the story began.	tiako ny fomba nanomboka ny tantara
Some come this way.	ny sasany dia avy aminity fomba ity
Of course you are right.	mazava ho azy fa marina ny anao
They will do it.	hanao izany izy ireo
It was instantaneous.	teo no ho eo izany
A man is not needed.	tsy ilaina ny lehilahy iray
I am only one person, but they are three.	olona iray ihany aho fa telo izy ireo
You can do it first.	azonao atao aloha ilay izy
So very different.	ka tena hafa mihitsy
And it’s like everyone else.	ary toy ny tsirairay izany
But even there are things that aren’t so simple.	saingy na dia misy aza ny zavatra tsy dia tsotra loatra
And other things.	ary ny zavatra hafa
In the end, great work.	aminny farany asa lehibe
We were far from the truth in that idea.	lavitra ny zavamisy izahay taminizany hevitra izany
And women just love him.	ary tia azy fotsiny ny vehivavy
You have it all.	manana izany rehetra izany ianao
However, it may not be enough.	na izany aza dia mety tsy ho ampy
Maybe something big is missing here.	misy zavatra lehibe tsy ampy eto angamba
But, if he leaves.	fa raha lasa izy
I'm not for you.	tsy ho anao aho
I don’t think that could be much.	heveriko fa tsy mety ho betsaka izany
I like it when they do.	tiako raha manao izany izy ireo
I will be good to you.	ho tsara aminao aho
Everyone who comes first is here.	izay rehetra tonga aloha dia eto
No one told me they were there.	tsy nisy nilaza tamiko fa tany izy ireo
Yours.	ny tena anao
This can be difficult, especially at first.	mety ho sarotra izany indrindra aminny voalohany
It’s not here or there right now.	tsy eto na any izany aminizao fotoana izao
Therefore, such a fact is unnecessary.	noho izany ny zavamisy toy izany dia tsy ilaina
I thank them for that.	misaotra azy ireo aho noho izany
No immediate action.	tsy misy hetsika eo noho eo
And maybe he knew it.	ary angamba fantany izany
We have many of them here, in fact.	manana maro aminizy ireo eto isika raha ny marina
He really had a problem.	tena nanana olana izy
It could be something else as well.	mety ho zavatra hafa koa izany
And everything.	ary ny zavatra rehetra
So that's one thing.	ka zavatra iray izany
I hope you will.	manantena aho fa hanao izany ianao
Someone might be watching him even now.	mety misy mijery azy na dia izao aza
If at all.	raha misy mihitsy aza
Lowest life of the worst kind.	fiainana ambany indrindra aminny karazana ratsy indrindra
No one else will do it.	tsy misy hafa hanao izany
He walked me through everything.	nandeha ahy taminny zavadrehetra izy
They don’t start until they get there.	tsy manomboka izy ireo raha tsy tonga any
Previously, in fact.	teo aloha raha ny marina
Normally, this will not be a problem.	raha ny mahazatra dia tsy ho olana izany
We don't want to do anything wrong here.	tsy te hanao ratsy izahay eto
The women looked at him.	nijery azy ny vehivavy
They didn't look.	tsy nijery izy ireo
It will happen again.	mbola hisy indray izany
It was a great time for us.	fotoana lehibe ho anay izany
He had seen one before.	efa nahita iray izy taloha
He wants to do something.	te hanao zavatra izy
But for good reason.	saingy noho ny antony tsara izany
I lost two bucks there.	very vola roa teo
He was completely lost.	efa very tanteraka izy
I'm really crazy.	tena adala aho
He is good too.	tsara koa izy
But they are very different.	tena samy hafa anefa izy ireo
I was close to him.	efa akaiky azy aho
Or check it out.	na jereo izany
But, you know, the good.	saingy fantatrao ny tsara
In fact, these are not for everyone.	raha ny marina tsy natao ho anny rehetra ireo
It may even be.	mety ho izany aza
It really doesn’t.	tena tsy manao izany
You don’t have to do too much.	tsy mila manao zavatra be loatra ianao
I don’t see many of them anymore.	tsy mahita ny maro aminizy ireo intsony
We are different.	samy hafa isika
Nothing good will come of it.	tsy hisy zavatra tsara ho avy aminizany
Apparently he didn’t.	toa tsy nanao izany izy
Although the woman did not.	na dia tsy nanao izany aza ilay vehivavy
But that war will not end.	tsy ho tanteraka anefa izany ady izany
The movement then moved quickly.	nandeha haingana ny hetsika avy eo
They are so ugly.	tena ratsy tarehy izy ireo
But they are easy to spot.	mora hita anefa izy ireo
You won't be long.	tsy ho ela ianao
It just became a bad habit.	lasa fomba ratsy fotsiny izany
I am not only of this earth.	tsy ity tany ity ihany aho
However, they have recently become more common.	na izany aza vao haingana izy ireo no lasa mahazatra kokoa
However, it is not good.	na izany aza dia tsy tsara
The special here is for everyone.	ny manokana eto dia natao ho anny rehetra
It all works well.	miasa tsara daholo izany rehetra izany
Anyway, it's bad here.	na izany na tsy izany ratsy ny eto
He should be here soon.	tokony ho eto izy tsy ho ela
You have no choice but to have one.	tsy manana safidy tsy manana iray ianao
He told me he was.	nilaza tamiko izy fa izy
Even the truth.	na dia ny marina aza
It’s still a good place.	mbola toerana tsara izy io
Maybe, yes, but not easy.	mety eny fa tsy mora
Here, too, there are options.	eto koa dia misy safidy
Another method is as follows.	fomba iray hafa toy izao manaraka izao
Right now he doesn’t need it.	aminizao fotoana izao dia tsy mila azy izy
To them, it seems the least.	aminizy ireo dia toa ny kely indrindra izany
You belong to another world.	anny tontolo hafa ianao
Then he had to say it.	dia tsy maintsy nilaza izany izy
For himself alone.	ho anny tenany ihany
I finally see why.	hitako ihany ny antony
Not yet, not then.	tsy mbola tsy avy eo
There isn’t much for me.	tsy dia misy loatra amiko
Simple methods were best for me, he said.	fomba tsotra no tena tsara tamiko hoy izy
You can have more than one.	afaka manana mihoatra ny iray ianao
Make this work possible.	ataovy azo atao izany asa izany
Not all the way.	tsy ny lalana rehetra
Maybe it needs to be big.	mila lehibe angamba izany
So there is one more thing.	noho izany dia misy zavatra iray hafa
And now it seems bigger than anything else, the past.	ary ankehitriny izany dia toa lehibe noho ny zavatra hafa rehetra ny lasa
Make me look more like them.	ataovy mijery ahy mihoatra noho izy ireo
Time passed quickly.	nandeha haingana ny fotoana
But it's another way.	fa fomba hafa indray izany
We really hope they do.	manantena tokoa izahay fa hanao izany izy ireo
No one ever loved me.	tsy nisy olona tia ahy mihitsy
And it doesn’t take long.	ary tsy mila ela
It can be hard to.	mety ho sarotra ny
She is as beautiful as you.	tsara tarehy toa anao izy
He’s a bit insecure.	somary tsy azo antoka izy
Lots of places.	betsaka ny toerana
You know that’s a big problem.	fantatrao fa olana lehibe izany
They have no reason whatsoever.	tsy manana antony na inona na inona izy ireo
Yes, he couldn’t have had anything better.	eny tsy nanana zavatra tsara kokoa izy
This image does not exist.	tsy misy io sary io
No job is easy.	tsy misy asa mora
And of course he didn’t want to be seen.	ary mazava ho azy fa tsy te ho hita izy
In reality, however, it is more than just money.	raha ny marina anefa dia mihoatra noho ny vola fotsiny izany
Then it all made sense.	dia nisy dikany daholo izany rehetra izany
Do things for others.	hanao zavatra ho anny hafa
They didn't seem happy to see me.	toa tsy faly izy ireo nahita ahy
He knew it was him.	fantany fa izy ilay izy
A world that is often for no reason.	tontolo izay matetika tsy misy antony
Yes, no, but you get the picture.	eny tsy izany fa azonao ny sary
I was glad to see that.	faly aho nahita izany
Now it works.	ankehitriny dia miasa izany
I'm so glad you're here !.	tena faly aho fa eto ianao
I know you love him and he loves you.	fantatro fa tia azy ianao ary tia anao izy
Anything to come.	izay rehetra ho avy
But the simple truth is, he is free.	saingy ny marina tsotra dia afaka izy
Just such a great man.	lehilahy lehibe toy izany ihany
Fun, simple and straightforward.	mahafinaritra tsotra ary tsotra
It seems too real.	toa tena zavamisy loatra ilay izy
I didn’t have that problem.	tsy nanana izany olana izany aho
Only one person.	olona iray ihany
He didn’t want to see her unhappy.	tsy tiany ny mahita azy tsy faly
I just had no choice.	tsy nanana safidy fotsiny aho
I looked up and down.	nijery ambony sy ambany aho
But that is not for us.	tsy anay anefa izany
Many people will love you.	olona maro no ho tia anao
This can be very difficult at times.	mety ho sarotra be izany indraindray
But not everyone agrees on that.	saingy tsy mitovy hevitra ny rehetra momba izany
But he will do good to her.	fa hanao zavatra tsara ho azy izy
But I can get one.	afaka mahazo iray anefa aho
No one made time.	tsy nisy nanao fotoana
That’s the way he likes it.	izay no fomba tiany
I will not miss this one.	tsy ho very ity iray ity aho
But that won’t matter.	tsy ho zavadehibe anefa izany
That was his favorite word.	izany no teny tiany indrindra
He is a wonderful man.	lehilahy mahafinaritra izy
Next time, it won't.	aminny manaraka dia tsy izany
Don’t say it’s nothing.	aza atao hoe tsy inona izany
No, it didn’t make sense.	tsia tsy nisy dikany izany
They have been around for a long time.	efa ela izy ireo
He was the world to him.	izy no izao tontolo izao taminy
This is a crazy car.	izany dia fiara adala
We just went.	nandeha fotsiny izahay
It's different but that's all.	hafa ihany fa izay ihany
But now he is dead.	efa maty anefa izy izao
And you may not have been there.	ary mety tsy teo akory ianao
Not like real work.	tsy toy ny tena asa
But this is not a normal day.	tsy andro mahazatra anefa izany
So it can’t be that bad.	noho izany dia tsy mety ho ratsy izany
He is long gone.	efa ela izy no lasa
There has never been more than that.	tsy mbola nisy mihoatra izany
Crazy fast too.	haingana adala koa
He always might, but it’s different.	izy foana angamba saingy hafa izany
It should be clear.	tokony ho hita mazava izany
if that is the way.	raha izany no lalana
Of course, they were wrong.	mazava ho azy fa diso hevitra izy ireo
But we.	fa isika
That’s the big part.	izany no ampahany lehibe
It is also easy to get there.	mora ihany koa ny mandeha any
I'm with some people there.	miaraka aminny olona sasany any aho
you are mine.	ahy ianao
It’s that simple thing.	izany zavatra tsotra izany
Very far.	tena lavitra
It seems a bit.	toa somary
But this idea is misleading.	saingy diso hevitra io hevitra io
If he likes, fine.	raha tiany tsara
People seem far away.	toa lavitra ny olona
I just got an idea.	vao avy nahazo hevitra aho
The work comes first, and then the talk about it.	ny asa no voalohany ary avy eo ny resaka momba izany
You do nothing.	tsy manao na inona na inona ianao
There was a time and a past.	nisy fotoana sy lasa
So is he ?.	noho izany dia izy
Simple process.	dingana tsotra
However, these methods have their own problems.	manana olana manokana anefa ireo fomba ireo
In fact, he can’t either.	raha ny marina tsy afaka izy koa
One trip didn’t make sense to me.	tsy nisy dikany tamiko ny dia iray
This one is for you.	ity iray ity dia ho anao
Not many like him.	tsy maro ny toa azy
But this is not the only time.	saingy tsy izao fotsiny ny fotoana
He knew it was wrong.	fantany fa tsy mety izany
He did not have to work for himself.	tsy nila nanao asa ho anny tenany izy
There was no word from him.	tsy nisy teny taminy
Just beautiful food.	sakafo tsara tarehy fotsiny
Even from a distance, there was nothing wrong.	na dia avy lavitra aza dia tsy nisy diso
Sometimes it’s money.	indraindray dia ny vola
Not immediately.	tsy avy hatrany
They are like us.	toa antsika izy ireo
He could not find his way.	tsy nahita lalana izy
These three are completely different.	samy hafa tanteraka ireo telo ireo
If they don’t deserve it, of course.	raha tsy mendrika izany izy ireo mazava ho azy
Best of all, no one told me that.	ny tsara indrindra dia tsy nisy nilaza tamiko izany
I look at the facts now.	mijery ny zavamisy aho izao
I was that age.	taminizany taona izany aho
Either way.	na izany na ny
you get it.	azonao izany
A little different from the others.	hafa kely aminny hafa
Once something was difficult for me.	indray mandeha dia nisy zavatra sarotra tamiko
From this point on.	avy eo aminity fotoana ity
Then you will understand my problem.	dia ho azonao ny olana mahazo ahy
But not for pictures.	tsy ho anny sary anefa
It's not clear.	tsy mazava ilay izy
It's not here.	tsy eto izany
Now, he will do it.	ankehitriny hanao izany izy
The world is smaller.	kely kokoa izao tontolo izao
Men can be like that.	mety ho toy izany ny lehilahy
Lots of days.	be ny andro
Not now.	tsy izao
He is the happiest here.	izy no faly indrindra eto
It's faster here.	haingana kokoa ny eto
It didn’t really do anything.	tsy tena nanao na inona na inona izany
And that's exactly where he wanted to be.	ary teo indrindra no tiany hisy
But he is busy.	be atao anefa izy
Easy to find.	mora hita
These are the same games.	ireo no lalao mitovy
So it’s really hard sometimes.	noho izany dia tena sarotra indraindray
But you love life.	fa tianao ny fiainana
They don't see anyone around.	tsy mahita olona manodidina izy ireo
This is despite the fact.	izany dia na dia eo aza ny zavamisy
It was actually fun to watch.	nahafinaritra ny nijery raha ny marina
New ideas come.	tonga ny hevitra vaovao
And you follow him.	ary ianao manaraka azy
You don't see anything.	tsy mahita na inona na inona ianao
If they’re good, that’s it.	raha tsara izy ireo dia izay
Good when good.	tsara rehefa tsara
So it is now.	toy izany koa izy izao
No one can expect more from me.	tsy misy olona afaka manantena bebe kokoa amiko
Or, it might have made a bad story.	na mety ho nanao tantara ratsy izany
We did well.	nanao tsara izahay
He’s a lot of people.	olona be dia be izy
Clearly, we disagree.	mazava fa tsy mitovy hevitra isika
The following is not working.	ity manaraka ity dia tsy mandeha
He’s not my type.	tsy karazana ahy izy
His had none.	ny azy tsy mba nanana
Just a lot of talk.	resaka be dia be fotsiny
You really are not alone.	tena tsy ianao irery
And now he’s no worse than that.	ary ankehitriny izy dia tsy ratsy noho izany
I love him for some things.	tiako izy noho ny zavatra sasany
So you draw.	noho izany dia manao sary ianao
Some do and some don’t.	misy manao ary misy tsy manao
But they can't see me.	tsy mahita ahy anefa izy ireo
Either way, it’s definitely three.	na izany na tsy izany azo antoka fa telo izany
And he said to me.	ary hoy izy tamiko
Such a wonderful person.	olona mahafinaritra toy izany
People need everything.	ny olona dia mila ny zavatra rehetra
You shouldn't love me.	tsy tokony ho tia ahy ianao
In the end, there was a small place with no road.	taminny farany dia nisy toerana kely tsy nisy lalana
There is no end.	tsy misy farany
The real world is very different.	ny tontolo tena izy dia tena hafa tanteraka
I think everything is going well.	heveriko fa mandeha tsara ny zavadrehetra
The reason is money.	ny antony dia ny vola
The people working there are really good.	tena tsara ny olona miasa ao
I got it too.	nahazo izany koa aho
And then, he.	ary avy eo izy
That one moment.	izay fotoana iray
There is nothing you can do.	tsy misy azonao atao
It’s very easy to do too.	tena mora ny manao azy koa
No news yet.	tsy mbola misy vaovao
There is just something wrong with them.	misy zavatra tsy mety aminizy ireo fotsiny
See also picture.	jereo koa ny sary
He said I can do better than you.	nilaza izy fa afaka manao tsara kokoa noho ianao aho
But for good reason.	saingy noho ny antony tsara
It could be one of a woman, a man, or both.	mety ho iray aminny vehivavy lehilahy na izy roa
The food is always good.	tsara foana ny sakafo
More than anything else, because it is impossible.	mihoatra noho ny zavatra hafa rehetra satria tsy azo atao izany
But there was a problem.	nisy olana anefa taminizany
He went too far, too fast.	lasa lavitra loatra izy haingana loatra
You die, it starts all over again.	maty ianao manomboka indray izany
But everything is real.	fa ny zavadrehetra dia tena izy
I have never seen him like that before.	mbola tsy nahita azy toy izany mihitsy aho
Which is small.	izay kely
I love them both together.	tiako izy roa miaraka
But there were also problems.	nisy olana koa anefa
In good times, we really have fun.	aminny fotoana mahafinaritra dia tena mahafinaritra tokoa isika
Yes, not so much, but you get the picture.	eny tsy izany loatra fa azonao ny sary
And now, the time has come.	ary ankehitriny tonga ny fotoana
Glad to see you so happy with this.	faly mahita anao faly be aminity
It generally goes like this.	aminny ankapobeny dia mandeha toy izao
In fact, everything is true.	raha ny marina dia marina ny zavadrehetra
It only takes a little while.	mila fotoana kely fotsiny izany
And these are the three best.	ary ireo no telo tsara indrindra
Everyone there is from another place.	avy aminny toerana hafa ny olona rehetra ao
I love him and we generally agree.	tiako izy ary mitovy hevitra izahay aminny ankapobeny
You must want to do that.	tsy maintsy te hanao izany ianao
You still have me.	mbola manana ahy ianao
The same is true when you walk down the street.	toy izany koa rehefa mandeha aminny lalana ianao
He didn't seem to need food.	toa tsy nila sakafo izy
Really looking at this car.	tena mijery ity fiara ity
We need you more than ever.	mila anao mihoatra noho ny taloha izahay
Yes, there was nothing much about him.	eny tsy nisy zavatra be taminy mihitsy
Therefore, all these places had special significance.	noho izany ireo toerana rehetra ireo dia nanana dikany manokana
Just now.	aminizao fotoana izao ihany
The idea is as follows.	ny hevitra dia izao manaraka izao
You know we are free.	fantatrao fa afaka izahay
This man is crazy.	adala ity lehilahy ity
And this is crazy talk though.	ary izao resaka adala izao fa
Whether or not, that is the question.	na ho na tsia izany no fanontaniana
She knew she really loved me.	fantany fa tena tia ahy izy
They are for everyone.	natao ho anny rehetra izy ireo
It is also important.	zavadehibe ihany koa
Better, simpler, to do it.	tsara kokoa tsotra ny manao izany
And many other problems.	ary maro ny olana hafa
Here's what you need to know.	izao no tokony ho fantatrao
That is a true word.	teny marina izany
And the former.	ary ilay teo aloha
In general, this should be possible.	aminny ankapobeny dia tokony ho azo atao izany
Apparently not doing so.	toa tsy nanao toy izany
You don’t know where it is.	tsy fantatrao ny misy azy
People love you more.	ny olona tia anao kokoa
And there’s nothing you can do about it.	ary tsy misy azonao atao momba izany
But that will not happen.	tsy ho tanteraka anefa izany
People have been doing this for too long.	efa ela loatra ny olona no nanao izany
That’s already a lot.	efa betsaka tokoa izany
It works the other way.	miasa aminny fomba hafa izany
As follows.	toy izao manaraka izao
Just a bad day, a hard day.	andro ratsy fotsiny andro sarotra
For men, it’s easier.	ho anny lehilahy dia mora kokoa izany
However, one thing is missing.	na izany aza misy zavatra iray tsy ampy
Do that.	ataovy izay
That place belongs to him.	azy io toerana io
To the top, to the bottom.	hatrany ambony hatrany ambany
The people you love.	ny olona tianao
Maybe that’s not a bad thing.	tsy ratsy angamba izany
But he did not tell her.	tsy nilaza izany taminy anefa izy
The latter, however, is different.	hafa anefa ity farany
Nobody does that.	tsy misy olona manao izany
Yes, you can have a choice.	eny afaka manana safidy ianao
She didn't look very pretty now.	tsy nijery tsara tarehy loatra izy izao
There may be words like that.	mety hisy teny toy izany
But it is well worth it.	tena mendrika izany anefa izany
No one should be there.	tsy misy olona tokony ho eo
An option is more difficult when there really is.	sarotra kokoa ny safidy iray rehefa misy tokoa
It may not work at first.	mety tsy mety aminny voalohany
An idea came to me.	nisy hevitra tonga tamiko
It was no different that day.	tsy nisy hafa taminizany andro izany
It could be another year, at most.	mety ho taona hafa raha be indrindra
Not the reason.	tsy ny antony
I never want to go wrong with anything.	tsy te ho diso na inona na inona mihitsy aho
This great work has been accomplished.	tanteraka io asa lehibe io
It was an event for them.	hetsika ho azy ireo izany
I have never seen anything like it.	mbola tsy nahita zavatra toy izao mihitsy
We don’t have the money.	tsy manana ny vola izahay
It’s a real picture.	tena sary izany
And they are not alone.	ary tsy irery izy ireo
Thanks you!.	misaotra betsaka anao
I used to love you.	tia anao taloha
If this is a different time and place.	raha fotoana hafa sy toerana hafa ity
You don’t see many here.	tsy mahita maro eto ianao
I'm just small.	kely ihany aho
And that's all he knows.	ary izay ihany no fantany
She knew she was too old a woman for that.	fantany fa vehivavy lehibe loatra izy noho izany
I never seem to have enough.	toa tsy manana ny ampy mihitsy aho
Because you arrived early.	satria tonga aloha andro ianao
Not a good day.	tsy andro tsara
And he saw him.	dia nahita azy izy
But it can be good.	mety tsara anefa
He loved it too.	tiany koa ilay izy
It's not something special.	tsy zavatra manokana akory izany
No, it's one.	tsia iray izy io
Lost, in other words.	very aminny teny hafa
Although I don’t do much about it in real life.	na dia tsy manao zavatra betsaka momba izany aminny tena fiainana aza
But of course he has a choice.	saingy mazava ho azy fa manana safidy izy
If it doesn’t make sense to you, they may be wrong.	raha tsy misy dikany aminao dia mety diso lalana izy ireo
And it really does.	ary tena manao izany
In the real world.	aminny tontolo tena izy
I think it’s a fun thing to see.	amiko dia zavatra mahafinaritra ny nahita izany
But no matter what, he was happy.	fa na inona na inona izy dia faly
They will both do it.	samy hanao izany izy ireo
He knew he would.	fantany fa hanao izany izy
This can be difficult for him.	mety ho sarotra aminy izany
There’s a lot of it all here.	be dia be eto izy rehetra
This is a fun route.	ity no lalana mahafinaritra
They are exactly the same.	mitovy tanteraka izy ireo
This is a good game for us.	lalao tsara ho antsika io
They both do it.	samy manao izany izy roa
It didn’t seem to be there.	toa tsy nisy teo
No one went either.	tsy nisy nandeha koa
I think they are the same.	heveriko fa mitovy ihany izy ireo
There should be, of course.	tokony hisy izany mazava ho azy
It is far more important than that.	zavadehibe lavitra noho izany izany
And so it is with them.	ary noho izany dia azy ireo
It can’t be much.	tsy mety ho betsaka izany
Everything is smaller.	kely kokoa ny zavadrehetra
That will be the age.	izany no ho taona
Sounds like bad news.	toa vaovao ratsy
Look at it like this.	jereo toy izao
Because one thing is clear.	satria zavatra iray no mazava
Certainly not money.	azo antoka fa tsy vola
These are the simple things in life.	ireo no zavatra tsotra eo aminny fiainana
I have someone.	manana olona aho
This is as it should be.	izany dia araka ny tokony ho izy
He knows life there.	fantany ny fiainana any
It shouldn’t be too hard.	tsy tokony ho mafy loatra izany
I am happy and excited.	faly sy faly aho
You did a great job and everyone had fun.	nanao asa mahafinaritra ianao ary nahafinaritra ny rehetra
A little money, often.	vola kely matetika
But it’s still not there.	saingy mbola tsy misy izany
They are really good though !.	tena tsara izy ireo na izany aza
No one gets it.	tsy misy mahazo izany
She is such a woman.	vehivavy toy izany izy
He seems to be a very nice person.	toa olona tena mahafinaritra izy
Nothing seems certain anymore.	tsy misy toa azo antoka intsony
And it’s really good, too, and really fast.	ary tena tsara koa ilay izy ary tena haingana tokoa
It’s really crazy, too.	tena adala ihany koa izany
But the time has come.	saingy tonga ny fotoana
In fact, everything is here.	raha ny marina dia eto daholo ny zavadrehetra
And next time.	ary aminny manaraka
However, this does not make sense.	na izany aza tsy misy dikany izany
Nor will he be the last.	tsy izy koa no ho farany

But some of these people.	fa ny sasany aminireo olona ireo
That's enough, if he does.	ampy izay raha manao izany izy
Someone who loves you.	olona tia anao
Maybe it won’t be too bad.	angamba tsy ho ratsy loatra izany
She’s fun, we both love her.	mahafinaritra izy samy tia azy izahay
But he had a choice.	nanana safidy anefa izy
I went there once.	nandeha tany aho indray mandeha
It’s not something you get.	tsy zavatra azonao izany
He deserves them.	mendrika azy ireo izy
There is no specific reason.	tsy misy antony manokana
Then we started.	dia nanomboka izahay
Everything is not about you.	tsy momba anao ny zavadrehetra
We have them all.	manana azy rehetra isika
But at the time, there were other problems.	saingy taminizany fotoana izany dia nisy olana hafa
But that is how it should be.	izany anefa no tokony ho izy
I don't have any pictures from here.	tsy manana sary avy eto aho
Thank you for seeing me.	misaotra anao nahita ahy
It’s not that you’re going to get far.	tsy hoe ho tonga lavitra ianao
It was not a pleasant time.	tsy fotoana nahafinaritra izany
This is a little tricky.	ity no kely sarotra
Not far from here.	tsy lavitra ny eto
In general, they are not.	aminny ankapobeny dia tsy izy ireo
And here I am.	ary eto aho
See me if you have any questions.	jereo aho raha manana fanontaniana ianao
Not so clear, this.	tsy dia mazava loatra ity
These times are still very new.	mbola vaovao tokoa ireo fotoana ireo
However, this method is not always possible.	tsy azo atao foana anefa izany fomba izany
Yes, so am I.	eny toy izany koa ny ahy
The truth is there is none.	ny marina dia tsy misy
People see what they want to see.	mahita izay tiany ho hita ny olona
He could do it now, come here.	afaka nanao izany izy izao tonga eto
I'm so glad you came.	faly be aho fa tonga ianao
Now it’s theirs.	aminizao fotoana izao dia azy ireo izany
This is similar to some previous products.	izany dia mitovy aminny vokatra sasany teo aloha
It’s a fun job.	asa mahafinaritra izany
But he may not have done so.	mety tsy nanao izany anefa izy
I knew it would be there.	fantatro fa ho eo izany
But something else.	fa ny zavatra hafa
It’s almost unnecessary.	saika tsy ilaina izany
He can't do it anymore.	tsy afaka manao izany intsony izy
There is too much that can go wrong.	be loatra ny mety ho diso
As soon as you can.	raha vao azonao atao
And not anymore.	ary tsy izany intsony
He doesn't like any of them.	tsy tiany ny iray aminireo
Finally it came, too fast and too hard.	farany dia tonga haingana sy mafy loatra
I love mine.	tiako ny ahy
I always see.	hitako foana
It doesn’t matter you say.	tsy zavadehibe hoy ianao
There is one.	misy iray
I came up with something else.	tonga aminny zavatra hafa aho
I think not.	heveriko fa tsy
Like, really fast.	toy ny tena haingana
But this one isn’t too bad.	tsy dia ratsy loatra anefa ity iray ity
I just like mine.	izay ahy fotsiny no tiako
True, this is easy.	marina fa mora izany
That is the reality of life.	izany no zavamisy eo aminny fiainana
So, almost everything then.	noho izany saika ny zavadrehetra avy eo
So it’s not easy.	noho izany dia tsy mora izany
Then we will do nothing.	dia tsy hanao na inona na inona izahay
It shouldn’t come from you either.	tsy tokony ho avy aminao koa izany
He seems very small.	toa kely dia kely izy
She always thought about him.	nieritreritra momba azy foana izy
I will come here and he will come.	ho avy eto aho ary ho avy izy
I am happy with this work.	faly aho aminity asa ity
Older than you.	be taona kokoa noho ianao
They are often homeless.	matetika izy ireo no tsy manana trano
People seem to love this event.	toa tia anio hetsika io ny olona
They have the same idea of ​​life.	mitovy hevitra aminny fiainana koa izy ireo
You do a wonderful job.	manao asa mahafinaritra ianao
So thank you so much for that.	koa misaotra indrindra noho izany
But this was not possible.	tsy azo natao anefa izany
Such a place is very wrong.	tena diso ny toerana toy izany
Almost as good as new.	saika tsara toy ny vaovao
I looked at her, a woman my age.	nijery azy aho vehivavy mitovy taona amiko
I had a similar problem.	nanana olana mitovy aminizany koa aho
Don’t expect the worst.	tsy manantena ny ratsy
Otherwise, we can go somewhere.	raha tsy izany dia afaka mandeha any aminny toerana iray isika
It just goes.	mandeha fotsiny izany
There is more money around.	misy vola bebe kokoa manodidina
I have to love the man.	tsy maintsy tia ilay lehilahy aho
The reality is different.	hafa ny zavamisy
I think he’s a good fit for that.	heveriko fa mety tsara aminizany izy
Don’t do it with the same picture.	aza manao izany aminny sary mitovy
It’s tough, as you know.	mafy izany araka ny fantatrao
Many have this problem.	betsaka ny manana io olana io
Nothing good comes easily.	tsy misy zavatra tsara tonga mora
While it is large, it is very low.	na dia lehibe aza izany dia ambany dia ambany
You may never do something wrong.	mety hanao zavatra tsy mety mihitsy ianao
The truth is, they didn’t.	ny marina dia tsy nanao izany izy ireo
They will know.	ho fantany
But that’s not all.	saingy tsy izany rehetra izany
Of course there is, but not for you.	mazava ho azy fa misy izany fa tsy ho anao
It was just fun.	nahafinaritra ihany ilay izy
The house is very nice.	tena tsara ny trano
Because there will be one.	satria hisy iray
I've known him for a long time, the man who went.	efa ela no fantatro izy ilay lehilahy nandeha
If it is real, you will not be lost.	raha tena izy dia tsy ho very ianao
There are so many of them.	tena betsaka izy ireo
It’s just not safe at all.	tsy azo antoka mihitsy izany
But all of this is new to me.	vaovao amiko anefa izany rehetra izany
It's his now.	azy izao
But we disagree.	tsy mitovy hevitra anefa izahay
All of this is completely wrong.	diso tanteraka izany rehetra izany
He is also dead now.	efa maty koa izao
Some are too small.	ny sasany dia kely loatra
The money was there.	teo ny vola
It may not be too important.	tsy mety ho zavadehibe loatra izany
Not everyone has the action.	tsy ny rehetra no manana ny hetsika
He knows the way from here.	fantany ny lalana avy eto
These are really good.	tena tsara tokoa ireo
There isn’t much of it.	tsy dia misy loatra izany
The game can be played in two ways.	ny lalao dia azo atao aminny fomba roa
Either way, it turns out that’s not the case.	na izany na tsy izany dia hita fa tsy izany no zavamisy
They look more beautiful in the picture.	toa tsara tarehy kokoa izy ireo aminny sary
Or maybe something more fun.	na angamba zavatra mahafinaritra kokoa
We look everywhere.	mijery eny rehetra eny izahay
But it’s probably not worth it.	saingy tsy mendrika izany angamba
It could never have done it properly.	tsy afaka nanao izany araka ny tokony ho izy mihitsy
Not bad at all but very good.	tsy ratsy mihitsy fa tena tsara
And then a man.	ary avy eo lehilahy iray
It is very important to do.	tena zavadehibe ny atao
I didn’t think of anything.	tsy nieritreritra zavatra aho
In fact, you are not.	raha ny marina tsy izany ianao
It has to be a process.	tsy maintsy misy dingana izany
Nothing from others.	tsy misy avy aminny hafa
He loved that car.	tiany io fiara io
People get it fast.	mahazo izany haingana ny olona
I’m glad I got it too.	faly koa aho nahazo azy
Both places didn’t go.	samy tsy nandeha ny toerana
The other reason is clear.	ny antony hafa dia mazava
It was a fight for me.	ady ho ahy izany
We are dead.	isika no maty
I hope you can do it and do it well.	manantena aho fa afaka manao izany ianao ary manao izany tsara
Or in my case.	na ao aminny ahy momba izany
Always looking at him.	mijery azy foana
Now we see two things.	aminizao fotoana izao isika dia mahita zavatra roa
Money though.	vola na izany aza
The first meaning is more familiar and more familiar.	ny dikany voalohany dia mahazatra kokoa sy mahazatra kokoa
Not work.	tsy asa
You would have thought.	ho nieritreritra ianao
No one died.	tsy misy olona maty
I don't need a part of this.	tsy mila ampahany aminity aho
Maybe, maybe not.	mety ho tsy ho
They did so.	nanao toy izany izy ireo
But they are confused.	very hevitra anefa izy ireo
But neither are they.	saingy tsy izy ireo koa
Look at all these things.	jereo ireo zavatra rehetra ireo
That was the most important thing to me.	izany no zavadehibe indrindra tamiko
It doesn’t seem too bad.	toa tsy ratsy loatra izany
But that is certainly not possible today.	azo antoka anefa fa tsy azo atao izany ankehitriny
They seem like a real choice to me.	toa toy ny safidy tena izy ireo amiko
He has it.	manana azy izy
He was completely honest.	nanao ny marina tanteraka izy
Well, just us.	eny ary izahay ihany
These are just two different ideas.	hevitra roa samy hafa fotsiny izany
They have a very big problem.	manana olana tena lehibe izy ireo
Whatever the amount.	na inona na inona vola
It’s really fun to be with him.	tena mahafinaritra ny miaraka aminy
But it must be true.	tsy maintsy marina anefa izany
It’s nothing, it’s always something you enjoy.	tsy inona na inona fa zavatra mahafinaritra anao foana
That’s where timing really matters.	ao no tena zavadehibe ny fotoana
Both questions are difficult.	samy sarotra ny fanontaniana roa
I didn’t do that at the time.	tsy nanao izany aho taminizany fotoana izany
Some may be easier.	ny sasany dia mety ho mora kokoa
But anything will be fast.	fa na inona na inona dia ho haingana
He said something ugly.	nilaza zavatra ratsy tarehy
We cannot be completely happy.	tsy afaka ny ho faly tanteraka isika
They are more than we are.	mihoatra noho isika izy ireo
Maybe you already know where it is.	angamba efa fantatrao ny misy azy
She's not very pretty.	tsy dia tsara tarehy loatra izy
They made a choice.	nanao safidy izy ireo
I work a lot.	miasa betsaka aho
But that word is too simple.	mora loatra anefa izany teny izany
But now he knows why.	fantany anefa izao ny antony
And they will know.	ary ho fantany
But they used to.	fa izy ireo taloha
Not yet.	mbola tsy misy aminizany
He does the most.	izy no manao indrindra
It could be wrong.	mety ho diso
Sometimes it is most secure.	indraindray dia azo antoka indrindra
It was important at the time.	zavadehibe taminny fotoana izany
Certainly not in the same way.	azo antoka fa tsy aminny fomba mitovy
I think you are right about that.	heveriko fa marina ny anao momba izany
The first game couldn’t have come quickly.	tsy afaka tonga haingana ny lalao voalohany
It goes well.	mandeha tsara
It won't be long now.	tsy ho ela intsony izao
It could be a good life.	mety ho fiainana tsara izany
Now, they are dead.	aminizao fotoana izao maty izy ireo
Many are very close to us.	maro no tena akaiky antsika
That's just fine.	tsara ihany izany
Just about him.	ny momba azy ihany
This game is great for two reasons.	ity lalao ity dia lehibe noho ny antony roa
You will always come at the right time for me.	ho tonga aminny fotoana mety amiko foana ianao
Either people need more time or they need more money.	na mila fotoana bebe kokoa ny olona na mila vola bebe kokoa
Sometimes this is true.	indraindray dia marina izany
It seemed certain to me.	toa azo antoka tamiko izany
There seemed to be no end to it.	toa dia tsy nisy farany izany
Life is so wonderful, full of beautiful people.	tena mahafinaritra ny fiainana feno olona tsara tarehy
And neither do you.	ary tsy ianao koa
They needed another place.	nila toerana hafa izy ireo
But it is necessary to do so.	ilaina anefa ny manao izany
People at their worst.	ny olona aminny ratsy indrindra
Yes, no problem.	eny tsy misy olana
Take a closer look at it.	jereo akaiky kokoa izany
In a safe place.	aminny toerana azo antoka
I see him sometimes.	mahita azy aho indraindray
The food was always delicious.	nahafinaritra foana ny sakafo
This one is for sure.	ity iray ity dia azo antoka
Others are right even when they are wrong.	marina ny hafa na dia diso aza
It’s been very close.	efa tena akaiky
There has to be a man, to be free.	tsy maintsy misy lehilahy iray mba ho afaka
But they were wrong.	diso anefa izy ireo
And once we did it.	ary indray mandeha dia nanao izany izahay
But that too, or it could be, me too.	fa izany koa na mety ho lasa ahy koa
We can make money together.	afaka mahazo vola miaraka izahay
I think that could be a problem.	heveriko fa mety ho olana izany
To me, these are two different things.	amiko dia zavatra roa samy hafa ireo
To me, he is very good.	amiko dia tena tsara izy
But it was a little bigger.	saingy somary lehibe kokoa ilay izy
There is a lot of good here.	betsaka ny tsara eto
Yes, it is possible.	eny azo natao izany
Finally, he said.	farany hoy izy
They are all confused.	very hevitra izy rehetra
Even the big ones maybe.	na ny lehibe aza angamba
The methods and results are different.	samy hafa ny fomba sy ny vokatra
But you are sure.	fa manana antoka ianao
This is the right choice for me.	ity no safidy mety amiko
There are a lot of men.	be dia be ny lehilahy
There was a fact.	nisy ny zavamisy
And you work on it, you know.	ary miasa aminizany ianao fantatrao
Because today, you don’t need one.	satria aminizao andro izao tsy mila iray ianao
Some make sense.	misy dikany ny sasany
You can make more money there.	afaka mahazo vola be kokoa ianao any
We have more.	manana bebe kokoa izahay
Certainly not necessary.	azo antoka fa tsy ilaina izany
That seems to be true of him.	toa marina izany raha ny momba azy
As such, it is not well understood at the moment.	araka izany tsy azo tsara izany aminizao fotoana izao
But you did.	saingy nanao izany ianao
He is coming now.	ho avy izy izao
Right now, things are not so good.	aminizao fotoana izao dia tsy dia tsara ny zavatra
In fact, we often have it.	raha ny marina dia manana izany matetika isika
We could not look to the future.	tsy afaka nijery ny ho avy izahay
This is the fastest way.	io no fomba haingana indrindra
He gets it from her.	mahazo izany avy aminy izy
It just won’t work.	tsy mety miasa fotsiny izany
Meaning, not too much.	ny dikany tsy dia be loatra
There isn’t one.	tsy misy na iray aza
Or maybe he had.	na mety nanana izy
It is not like today.	tsy toy ny ankehitriny koa izany
It takes him a night to get there.	mila alina izy vao tonga any
But he did not think.	tsy nieritreritra anefa izy
I'm too easy on you.	mora loatra aminao aho
It shouldn’t be too difficult.	tsy tokony ho sarotra loatra izany
I think you need something like that.	heveriko fa mila zavatra toy izany ianao
But they are the worst of the night.	fa izy ireo no ratsy indrindra aminny alina
See also.	jereo ihany koa
Certainly not all of them died.	azo antoka fa tsy maty daholo izy ireo
You look at me carefully.	mijery ahy tsara ianao
That’s the fun part of it.	izany no ampahany mahafinaritra aminizany
Kind of real.	karazana tena izy
Everyone seems to have gone too far.	toa lasa lavitra ny rehetra
I don't love you at all.	tsy tia anao mihitsy aho
Maybe you should do that.	angamba tokony hanao izany ianao
If not, that's it.	raha tsy izany dia izay no izy
I don't think that's right.	heveriko fa tsy mety izany
Very bad choice.	safidy tena ratsy
There are just no questions.	tsy misy fanontaniana fotsiny
Surely you get it.	azo antoka fa azonao izany
She was not yet beautiful.	tsy mbola tsara tarehy izy taminizany
You got someone.	nahazo olona ianao
But we are still the same.	saingy mbola mitovy ihany isika
You can easily find it from below.	afaka mahita azy mora foana ianao avy eto ambany
But for me it’s more than that.	fa ho ahy dia mihoatra noho izany
Two people, actually.	olona roa raha ny marina
Such a small step is important.	ny dingana kely toy izany dia zavadehibe
He doesn’t start a problem.	tsy manomboka olana izy
You are the first to become one.	ianao no voalohany ho lasa iray
So we have to see.	ka tsy maintsy mahita isika
He often does not come.	matetika izy no tsy tonga
But a little, though.	saingy kely na izany aza
I've seen him too.	efa nahita azy koa aho
This is not true.	tsy izany no marina
So his problem is different.	noho izany dia hafa ny olana aminy
I have to have it.	tsy maintsy manana izany aho
But the end soon came.	tsy ela anefa dia tonga ny farany
Just a little mistake.	diso hevitra kely fotsiny
Or the same.	na mitovy
Even the facts are enough.	na ny zavamisy dia ampy
You will definitely know.	tena ho fantatrao
They have to do both.	tsy maintsy manao ny roa izy ireo
But also .	fa koa
Far from the reality here.	lavitra ny zavamisy eto
They need me here.	mila ahy eto izy ireo
But he was nowhere to be found.	tsy hita anefa izy
I'm starting now.	manomboka izao aho
It was as if he didn’t want me to see what’s inside.	toy ny hoe tsy tiany ho hitako ny ao anatiny
Great stories are incomplete without them.	ny tantara lehibe dia tsy feno raha tsy misy azy ireo
Because you will know what is to come.	satria ho fantatrao izay ho avy
I didn’t need it anymore.	tsy nila izany intsony aho
They don’t want to be lost anymore.	tsy te ho very intsony izy ireo
That’s a close question.	fanontaniana akaiky izany
In fact, we are almost there.	raha ny zavamisy dia efa ho eo isika
Everyone seemed to be there.	toa efa teo daholo ny rehetra
Then it’s hard.	dia sarotra izany
Both can't.	samy tsy afaka
Just work.	asa fotsiny
You want to be happy with him.	te ho faly ianao miaraka aminy
Mine is yours.	ny ahy dia anao
It’s something similar.	zavatra mitovy aminy izany
They just arrived.	tonga taminizany ihany izy ireo
But he thought.	nieritreritra anefa izy
You are so beautiful now.	tena tsara tarehy ianao izao
But it went at a very bad time.	nandeha taminny fotoana tena ratsy anefa izany
He would never like it.	tsy ho tiany mihitsy izany
But when put together, it’s a real thing.	saingy raha miaraka dia tena zavatra izany
And that doesn’t even seem to be a question.	ary tsy hita ho fanontaniana akory izany
The process started on the first day.	nanomboka ny andro voalohany ny dingana
They finally came to me.	tonga tamiko ihany izy ireo
It’s when you’re really alone.	izy io no tena irery ianao
It’s just enough and not more.	ampy fotsiny izany fa tsy mihoatra
Surely I have never seen anyone like him.	azo antoka fa mbola tsy nahita olona toa azy aho
Very small, very beautiful.	tena kely tena tsara tarehy
From then on, everything went well.	nanomboka teo dia nandeha tsara ny zavadrehetra
No one was there either.	tsy nisy olona teo koa
The man is gone.	tsy misy ilay lehilahy
It’s hard for him, too.	sarotra aminy koa
I could have done better there.	afaka nanao izany tsara kokoa aho tany
We have to go with the conversation.	tsy maintsy mandeha aminny resaka isika
To be the best for him.	mba ho tsara indrindra ho azy
I can go together.	afaka miaraka aho
Now he loves it.	ankehitriny dia tiany izany
The world stopped.	nijanona izao tontolo izao
She’s more fun.	mahafinaritra kokoa izy
You can see where you are.	afaka mahita ny toerana misy anao ianao
This is great, great, exciting news.	vaovao lehibe lehibe mahafinaritra ity
He knew he was right.	fantany fa marina izy
But you know it really should.	saingy fantatrao fa tena tokony
Everything is crowded.	feno olona ny zavadrehetra
I think they had a great time.	heveriko fa nahafinaritra azy ireo ilay fotoana
First, it is true.	voalohany marina izany
Now that seems important to him.	ankehitriny dia toa zavadehibe aminy izany
But he really liked it.	tena tiany anefa izany
People like me, who have to work harder.	ny olona toa ahy izay tsy maintsy miasa mafy kokoa
Everything is not so bad.	tsy dia ratsy loatra ny zavadrehetra
That’s what’s important to me.	izay no zavadehibe amiko
They are similar in ways that are impossible.	izy ireo dia mitovy aminny lalana izay tsy azo atao
They all died.	maty daholo izy ireo
But he could not look far.	tsy afaka nijery lavitra anefa izy
Much easier.	tena mora kokoa
It didn't even make sense.	tsy nisy dikany akory izany
And, you can’t do anything about it.	ary tsy afaka manao na inona na inona momba izany ianao
They got in the way.	nahazo ny lalana izy ireo
yes maybe.	eny angamba
If it needed to do so.	raha nila nanao izany
I don’t have much.	tsy manana be dia be
And we have the means.	ary manana ny fomba
He has to have it all, somewhere.	tsy maintsy manana izany rehetra izany izy any ho any
You will not be at your best.	tsy ho aminny tsara indrindra ianao
They just didn’t have money.	tsy nanana vola fotsiny izy ireo
They have us.	manana antsika izy ireo
For some reason, they still don’t.	noho ny antony sasany dia mbola tsy manao izany izy ireo
Easy to understand.	tsotra azo
It’s good to have them.	tsara ny manana azy ireo
It shouldn’t be wrong.	tsy tokony ho diso
So it was always.	noho izany dia foana ilay izy
I'm just working.	miasa fotsiny aho
It is either good or not.	dia na tsara na tsia
It was crazy then.	adala izany taminizany
They can follow.	afaka manaraka izy ireo
The only way.	ny lalana ihany
While they were there.	raha mbola teo izy ireo
He often thought about it.	nieritreritra izany matetika izy
Otherwise, not everyone will love you.	raha tsy izany dia tsy ho tia anao ny rehetra
We all come from different places to get here.	avy aminny toerana samy hafa isika rehetra mba ho tonga eto
If there was nothing at first.	raha toa ka tsy nisy na inona na inona taminny voalohany
I don’t want to do it right away.	tsy te hanao izany avy hatrany aho
Something like this.	zavatra toy izao
But yes, they can only be for one thing.	saingy eny mety ho aminny zavatra iray fotsiny izy ireo
So here’s the idea.	ka izao no hevitra
There are other ways as well.	misy fomba hafa koa
And it’s not right at all.	ary tsy mety mihitsy
Now that doesn’t work.	ankehitriny dia tsy mandeha izany
I'm new there.	vaovao any aho
It's best you don't come.	tsara indrindra fa tsy tonga ianao
But there were many others.	nisy maro hafa anefa
Yes, he died.	eny maty izy
He did his thing.	izy no nanao ny azy
There is nothing at all.	tsy misy na inona na inona mihitsy
They do, but many die.	manao izany izy ireo saingy maro no maty
These were not enough.	tsy nisy tsy ampy ireo
Do it with you.	ataovy miaraka aminao izy
It couldn’t be easier.	tsy ho mora kokoa izany
In other words, at all times.	aminny teny hafa aminny fotoana rehetra
Yes, he had a wife.	eny nanana vehivavy iray izy
He just didn’t have it.	tsy nanana izany fotsiny izy
But we need a bigger conversation.	mila resaka lehibe kokoa anefa isika
But that is not the case.	tsy toy izany anefa ny zavamisy
It never worked.	tsy nandeha mihitsy izany
It was as if he hadn't even seen me.	toy ny tsy nahita ahy akory izy
These are the right words.	ireo teny marina ireo
I think people don’t work hard anymore.	heveriko fa tsy miasa mafy intsony ny olona
Just a lot of them.	betsaka aminizy ireo ihany
He still doesn't know it.	mbola tsy fantany izany
This is where we are.	eto no misy anay
If you do the.	raha manao ny
It could be something even more difficult.	mety ho zavatra sarotra kokoa aza izany
Instead of .	raha tokony ho
Sometimes what you get isn’t so fun.	indraindray dia tsy mahafinaritra loatra ny zavatra azonao
He is one and all.	izy dia iray ary izy rehetra
Yes, look at that.	eny jereo izany
It starts with where they are.	izany dia manomboka aminny toerana misy azy ireo
Or not too much.	na tsy dia be loatra
In fact, it is very common.	raha ny marina dia tena mahazatra izany
I know this earth means a lot to you.	fantatro fa misy dikany lehibe ho anao ity tany ity
It’s about us.	momba anay izany
They are not alone in this house.	tsy irery izy ireo tao aminity trano ity
First, just look around you.	voalohany jereo fotsiny ny manodidina anao
This is my favorite method because it is the easiest.	ity no fomba tiako indrindra satria io no mora indrindra
I’m good enough but not very good.	ampy aho fa tsy tena tsara
He can't look at me.	tsy afaka mijery ahy izy
There is nothing left for me in life.	tsy misy na inona na inona ho ahy intsony eo aminny fiainana
However, many did not.	na izany aza maro no tsy nanao izany
Here is a picture.	ity misy sary
There are too many of them now.	be loatra izy ireo ankehitriny
But no, nothing else.	saingy tsia tsy zavatra hafa
It means too much to you.	misy dikany loatra aminao izany
But it’s nice to be able to walk.	fa mahafinaritra ny afaka mandeha
I'm more fun.	mahafinaritra kokoa aho
He didn't even look closely.	tsy nijery akaiky azy akory
Then they do it again.	dia manao izany indray izy ireo
It could be one or both.	mety ho ny iray na izy roa
We hope he doesn’t.	manantena izahay fa tsy hanao izany izy
They usually do, you know.	matetika izy ireo no manao izany fantatrao
And he loved her.	ary tiany izy
I’ve thought about it at times.	efa nieritreritra izany aho indraindray
He was not there yet.	mbola tsy teo izy
They are never fun.	tsy mahafinaritra mihitsy izy ireo
But look at us now.	fa jereo izao izahay
Because of course he did.	satria mazava ho azy fa nanao izany
But we are not stupid.	tsy adala anefa izahay
I’m just a working guy.	lehilahy miasa fotsiny aho
The first part is the hardest.	ny ampahany voalohany no sarotra indrindra
There are even more women available.	mbola betsaka kokoa ny vehivavy azo atao
It was a real story.	tena tantara tokoa ilay izy
He had seen her.	efa nahita azy izy
Everyone said they liked the food.	nilaza ny rehetra fa tiany ilay sakafo
It’s well worth it when you look at the past.	tena mendrika izany rehefa mijery ny lasa ianao
I want you to understand me well.	tiako ho azonao tsara aho
And it can be very difficult.	ary mety ho sarotra be izany
You, more than anything.	ianao mihoatra noho ny zavatra rehetra
He was up there.	teo ambony teo izy
And soon he finds himself everywhere too.	ary tsy ho ela dia mahita ny tenany eny rehetra eny koa izy
Almost all or not.	saika ny rehetra na tsia
It’s crazy low.	adala ambany izany
I'm not wrong here.	tsy diso aho eto
Despite your surroundings.	na eo aza ny manodidina anao
Maybe they just love it.	angamba izy ireo ihany no tia izany
Now, now, now the others.	izao izao izao izao izao ny hafa
The good idea is the game.	ny hevitra tsara dia ny lalao
It was really hard to go.	tena sarotra ny nandeha
He could have had it.	afaka nanana azy izy
They always went.	nandeha foana izy ireo
It's the same for me.	mitovy ny ahy
But like an ordinary man.	fa toy ny lehilahy tsotra
Either once or a little.	na indray mandeha na kely
I have to go check it out.	tsy maintsy mandeha mijery izany aho
As far and as fast as possible.	lavitra sy haingana araka izay azo atao
You are the only one in the end lost.	ianao irery no ao aminny farany very
It’s not a good fit.	tsy tsara ny mety
He knows the way.	fantany ny lalana
No one did anything about it.	tsy nisy nanao na inona na inona momba izany
He comes and goes.	tonga izy ary mandeha
He will be very good, they said.	ho tena tsara izy hoy izy ireo
It’s not all about you.	tsy izy rehetra no momba anao
Or smaller they are.	na kely kokoa izy ireo
A great time.	fotoana lehibe iray
So check out this one.	ka jereo ity iray ity
Reasons more than others.	antony mihoatra noho ny hafa
He loves to be alone.	tia irery izy
I think they are great.	heveriko fa lehibe izy ireo
This will be difficult.	izany dia ho sarotra
So, it’s more complicated.	noho izany sarotra kokoa izany
So much so.	ka be loatra
It's too close.	efa akaiky loatra izany
But history and people are difficult.	sarotra anefa ny tantara sy ny olona
Don't do that to me again, he said.	aza manao izany amiko intsony hoy izy
There are so many fun things to do.	betsaka ny zavatra mahafinaritra azo atao
Sounds a lot of fun.	toa mahafinaritra be
I'm not hard.	tsy mafy aho
This is not the first time.	tsy vao voalohany izany
You usually are.	matetika ianao
The money was always there.	teo foana ny vola
Everything works like new.	miasa toy ny vaovao ny zavadrehetra
Part of it was that he was wrong.	ampahany taminizany fa diso izy
But it has to.	saingy tsy maintsy
And if you don’t like it, that’s fine.	ary raha tsy tianao dia tsara izany
He never really loved her.	tsy tena tia azy mihitsy izy
Well, he's a man.	eny ary lehilahy izy
And they all do.	ary manao izany izy rehetra
Money is another matter.	resaka hafa koa ny vola
There are at least two reasons for this.	misy antony roa eo ho eo aminizany
Very nice to see you too.	tena faly mahita anao koa
You are beautiful, as always.	tsara tarehy ianao toy ny mahazatra
I’m not here about that.	tsy eto aho momba izany
It is needed now more than ever.	ilaina izao mihoatra noho ny taloha
Very happy for you.	tena faly ho anao
This is my favorite news.	ity no tiako vaovao
There were no bad ideas.	tsy nisy hevitra ratsy
This is a fun part.	ity ampahany mahafinaritra ity
This is not yet the case.	tsy mbola izany no zavamisy
In fact, it had no idea of ​​itself at all.	raha ny marina dia tsy nanana hevitra momba ny tenany mihitsy izy io
The problem is he’s not really lost.	ny olana dia tsy tena very izy
I make money from work like that.	mahazo vola aminny asa toy izany aho
Here, we did something else.	eto nanao zavatra hafa izahay
You can check out the location below !.	azonao atao ny mijery ny toerana eto ambany
I had never had a problem before.	mbola tsy nisy olana mihitsy aho teo aloha
This is good news, in fact.	vaovao tsara izany raha ny marina
There was no place yet.	tsy mbola nisy toerana
And here again.	ary eto indray
Apparently this is not a problem.	hita fa tsy olana izany
Anything small is uncertain.	na inona na inona kely dia tsy azo antoka
So, we’re all there.	noho izany isika rehetra ao
I see, he said.	hitako hoy izy
It was a difficult time, for sure.	fotoana sarotra izany azo antoka
But he wasn't sure inside.	tsy nahazo antoka anefa izy tao anatiny
And that's not true yet.	ary tsy mbola marina izany
You can be simple too.	mety ho tsotra ihany koa ianao
That's it, no more.	izay ihany tsy misy intsony
We need to know that we are coming.	tokony ho fantany fa ho avy isika
I have always been like that.	toy izany foana aho
Everything seemed too big for him.	toa lehibe loatra ho azy ny zavadrehetra
I just don’t like him.	tsy tia azy fotsiny
It is also very special.	tena manokana koa io
Not much to go on.	tsy dia betsaka ny mandeha
It’s easier for us than that.	mora kokoa noho izy izany isika
Wrong but not right, because it can’t.	diso fa tsy tokony ho izy satria tsy afaka
But he doesn’t have it.	saingy tsy manana izy
People may lose their jobs because of it.	ny olona mety ho very asa noho izany
Nothing is clear.	tsy misy mazava
But you have to do the following.	saingy tsy maintsy manao izao manaraka izao ianao
And that’s the good part of it.	ary izany no ampahany tsara aminizany
But it is for everyone, not just you.	ho anny rehetra anefa izany fa tsy ho anao ihany
Which seems reasonable.	izay toa mety
I love it like no other.	tiako toy ny tsy misy hafa izany
I really like the game.	tiako be ilay lalao
However, it is not very difficult.	na izany aza tsy dia sarotra izany
Although both are now dead.	na dia samy maty aza izao
But the reality is a little different.	saingy hafa kely ny zavamisy
Other days, you may not.	aminny andro hafa mety tsy ianao
Here is a little about me.	ity misy kely momba ahy
The old way doesn’t seem to work for me.	toa tsy mety amiko ny fomba taloha
Things will be easier.	ho mora kokoa ny zavatra
I finally found the truth.	hitako ny marina taminny farany
Maybe he didn’t die.	angamba tsy maty izy
It didn’t say anything about the image.	tsy nilaza na inona na inona momba ny sary izany
We don’t look far.	tsy mijery lavitra izahay
Not the things around, everything.	tsy ny zavatra manodidina ny zavatra rehetra
It was nice to see them again.	nahafinaritra ny nahita azy ireo indray
In fact, this is the last one.	raha ny marina io no farany
I'm still okay.	mbola mety aho
But no one was there yet.	saingy mbola tsy nisy olona
Maybe even earlier.	angamba aloha aza
But, you know.	saingy fantatrao
First, you won’t be too mistaken.	voalohany tsy ho diso hevitra be ianao
For one thing, whatever.	aminny zavatra iray na inona na inona
It sounds so crazy.	toa adala be ilay izy
That’s great for me.	lehibe ho ahy izany
This game is very different.	hafa mihitsy ity lalao ity
So much easier.	ka tena mora kokoa
There are pictures inside.	misy sary ao anatiny
However, this is not a fun approach.	na izany aza tsy fomba mahafinaritra izany
Simple too.	tsotra koa
It is easy to see why.	mora ny nahita ny antony
Less work for everyone.	kely kokoa ny asa ho anny rehetra
And he has become a man.	ary efa lasa lehilahy izy
Then they are not.	dia tsy izy ireo
The road is still long.	mbola lavitra ny lalana
This is a simple process.	ity dia dingana tsotra
Not like ordinary people.	tsy toy ny olona mahazatra
You are hard, too hard for someone like him.	sarotra ianao sarotra loatra ho anny olona toa azy
Someone walks away.	misy olona mandeha lavitra
You may be right for the wrong reasons.	mety ho marina ianao noho ny antony diso
Those who see something else.	ireo izay mahita zavatra hafa
We need them.	mila azy ireo isika
Some even said he was.	nisy aza nilaza fa izy
I had it and lost.	nanana izany aho ary very
We have no idea.	tsy manana hevitra izahay
See that to come.	jereo fa ho avy
We still have time.	mbola manana fotoana isika
You have no job.	tsy manana asa ianao
I don't see any problem with that.	tsy hitako izay olana aminizany
I must be wrong.	tsy maintsy ho diso aho
It is possible now because it is possible.	azo atao izao satria azo atao
They are so much better.	tena tsara kokoa izy ireo
He was not there.	tsy nisy izy
I had no words.	tsy nanana teny aho
But a wonderful place.	toerana mahafinaritra anefa
Just like him.	toa azy ihany
That is, some do.	izany hoe manao izany ny sasany
I’m happy to be here right now.	faly aho eto aminizao fotoana izao
But it could come.	saingy mety ho tonga izany
But it’s not and it’s not.	saingy tsy izany ary tsy izany
And hard.	ary mafy
Not with him too high.	tsy miaraka aminy ambony loatra
It's not that he's not a good man.	tsy hoe tsy lehilahy tsara izy
Then he could tell her everything.	dia afaka nilaza taminy ny zavadrehetra izy
Got that part.	nahazo izany ampahany izany
They may be talking about crazy women.	mety ho resaka vehivavy adala izy ireo
However, the results are very good.	na izany aza ny vokatra dia tena tsara
Do to me what you want.	ataovy amiko izay tianao
In fact, like nothing.	raha ny marina toy ny tsy misy
They are real.	tena misy izy ireo
I looked at the house again.	nijery ny trano indray aho
They are no different.	tsy misy hafa aminizy ireo
It was fun, and it was easy, and there was no money.	nahafinaritra ary mora ary tsy nisy vola
Only one day and one night.	indray andro sy iray alina ihany
But to me, the worst is possible.	fa amiko ny ratsy indrindra azo atao
No next.	tsy misy manaraka
They have two approaches.	manana fomba roa izy ireo
That’s why there is no life there.	izany no tsy misy fiainana any
He was before.	teo aloha izy
In simple words.	aminny teny mora
It’s never safe to be around.	tsy azo antoka mihitsy ny manodidina azy
Everything.	ny zavatra rehetra
It just becomes normal.	lasa mahazatra fotsiny
Because we don’t.	satria tsy manao izany isika
Good timing is important.	zavadehibe ny fotoana tsara
There’s too much going on with it.	be loatra ny zavatra mandeha aminizany
He’s just tough.	mafy fotsiny izy
Yes, they could be.	eny mety ho izy ireo
And he never did.	ary tsy nanao izany mihitsy izy
The good ones, though.	ny tsara na izany aza
And that is the problem here.	ary izay no olana eto
I am a man.	lehilahy iray aho
He’s about all the time.	izy dia momba ny fotoana rehetra
She loves this food.	tiany io sakafo io
This is not easy for some for sure.	tsy mora izany ho anny sasany azo antoka
It doesn’t matter if it’s right or wrong.	tsy zavadehibe na marina izany na diso
But no one is right.	saingy tsy misy olona mety
But it’s not too much.	tsy dia be loatra anefa izany
It works for almost everything else.	saika miasa ho anny zavatra hafa rehetra izy io
This is not a distant story.	tsy tantara lavitra izany
We got there.	tonga any izahay
Some may be small and some may be more.	ny sasany mety ho kely ary ny sasany mety ho bebe kokoa
It is absolutely perfect.	tanteraka tokoa izany
And there seems to be no end in sight.	ary toa tsy misy farany intsony
I am so much more than that.	mihoatra lavitra noho izany aho
We thought nothing of it.	nieritreritra na inona na inona momba izany izahay
They could still do it.	mbola afaka nanao izany izy ireo
No, that's not all.	tsia tsy izay ihany
Certainly many of them are not.	azo antoka fa maro aminizy ireo no tsy
But everything was just made simple.	fa natao tsotra fotsiny ny zavadrehetra
There are many difficult reasons for this.	betsaka ny antony sarotra aminizany
I can't find the way.	tsy hitako ny lalana
History is lost.	very ny tantara
They’re just doing things.	manao zavatra fotsiny izy ireo
If he dies, there will be no more.	raha maty izy dia tsy hisy intsony
He loves her too.	tia azy koa izy
I think you would do the same, if you were there.	heveriko fa hanao izany koa ianao raha teo ianao
But it’s important to get a good understanding of everything about it.	fa zavadehibe ny mahazo tsara ny zavadrehetra momba izany
Sometimes not too much.	indraindray tsy dia be loatra
But all that is enough.	fa ampy izany rehetra izany
That is where we are.	izany no misy antsika
It should be easier.	tokony ho mora kokoa izany
Soon there will be questions, otherwise.	tsy ho ela dia hisy fanontaniana raha tsy izany
I was completely wrong.	diso tanteraka aho
He couldn’t be more wrong.	tsy mety diso kokoa izy
They seem real.	toa tena izy ireo
With things or people.	miaraka aminny zavatra na olona
But they are too far away.	lavitra loatra anefa izy ireo
I really want to do more in the future.	tena te hanao bebe kokoa aminny ho avy aho
What kind are they.	karazana inona izy ireo
We are always confused.	very hevitra foana izahay
Of course, the two are wrong.	mazava ho azy fa tsy mety ny roa
This is a good thing for all of us.	izany dia zavatra tsara ho antsika rehetra
I know yours, and you know mine.	fantatro ny anao ary fantatrao ny ahy
The first is very hard.	ny voalohany dia tena mafy
Nothing really came of it.	tsy misy zavatra tena tonga
Not all the time.	tsy aminny fotoana rehetra
They didn’t mean anything to me.	tsy nisy dikany tamiko izy ireo
There are no standard special effects.	tsy misy ny vokatra manokana mahazatra
But the process is not that simple.	saingy tsy dia tsotra ny dingana
It works and works for everyone.	miasa sy miasa ho anny rehetra izany
And he loves us.	ary tia anay izy
He is bad.	ratsy izy
This image is not entirely accurate.	tsy marina tanteraka io sary io
He must have it.	tsy maintsy manana izany izy
You are not pleasant.	tsy mahafinaritra ianao
And it works now.	ary miasa izao
I hope to be alone.	manantena ny ho irery aho
They had a problem.	nanana olana izy ireo
I also like good food.	tiako koa ny sakafo tsara
A very common problem.	olana tena mahazatra
It seems to come from everywhere.	toa avy eny rehetra eny izany
Almost everyone came.	saika ny rehetra no tonga
He is mine again.	ahy indray izy
Like, as he knows very well.	toy ny araka izay fantany tsara
And, of course, more of the story.	ary mazava ho azy bebe kokoa ny tantara
Everyone is really, really good.	ny olona rehetra dia tena tena tsara
This is a crazy fight.	ady adala izany
Available in.	misy aminny
It really doesn’t work.	tena tsy mandeha
It was more fun than it should be.	nahafinaritra kokoa noho ny tokony ho izy izany
To be mad.	ka adala be
Not too much last year.	tsy dia be loatra ny taona lasa
This should not have been done.	tsy tokony ho toy izany no natao
They expect results.	manantena vokatra izy ireo
But it’s not entirely simple.	saingy tsy tsotra tanteraka izany
I’m glad people love the product.	faly aho fa tia ny vokatra ny olona
She’s a great woman, very good.	vehivavy lehibe izy tena tsara
The simplest thing.	ny zavatra tsotra indrindra
But the next step is more difficult.	saingy sarotra kokoa ny dingana manaraka
But that is not the only option you have.	tsy izany ihany anefa no safidy azonao
It’s much safer for us.	tena azo antoka kokoa ho anay izany
The story is very interesting.	tena mahafinaritra ny tantara
One almost identical to it.	iray saika mitovy aminy
Some games too.	lalao sasany koa
Yes for both of us.	eny ho antsika roa
Far from the real thing for me.	lavitra ny tena zavamisy amiko
This is the first to come.	izany no tonga voalohany
We are far from home.	lavitra ny trano izahay
But you need to know that he loves you.	tokony ho fantatrao anefa fa tia azy izy
It’s a good problem to have.	olana tsara ny manana izany
Yes, he already knows that too.	eny efa fantany izany koa
It’s really simple.	tsotra tokoa izany
I’m just right now.	aminizao fotoana izao ihany aho
Not for the worst but not for the best.	tsy aminny ratsy indrindra fa tsy aminny tsara kokoa
I saw it one night.	nahita izany aho indray alina
I think that is absolutely true.	heveriko fa marina tanteraka izany
But that is a very bad idea.	tena ratsy anefa izany hevitra izany
It’s just a process.	dingana iray ihany izany
Overall good.	aminny ankapobeny dia tsara
He was great, in a different way.	lehibe izy taminny fomba hafa
He really isn’t that bad.	tena tsy ratsy izy
It will be different for everyone.	ho samy hafa ho anny rehetra izany
And it’s hard to do that.	ary sarotra ny manao izany
For two reasons.	noho ny antony roa
There will be no other day.	tsy hisy andro hafa
They have already started.	efa nanomboka izy ireo
He must have liked it.	tsy maintsy ho tiany izany
It’s a long way off.	dia lavitra be izany
However, you may need more money to get started.	na izany aza dia mety mila vola bebe kokoa aloha ianao vao manomboka
Like, not at all.	toy ny tsy izany mihitsy
But there are also bad reasons.	misy antony ratsy koa anefa
The ground stopped.	nijanona ny tany
But all is lost.	very daholo anefa izany
But they are different.	saingy samy hafa karazana izy ireo
Because it’s so beautiful.	satria tsara tarehy loatra

For me, for him, for us.	ho ahy ho azy ho antsika
You can do this easily.	afaka manao izany mora foana ianao
They need you here.	mila anao eto izy ireo
I love you, and you love me.	tiako ianao ary ianao tia ahy
You alone did it all.	ianao irery no nanao izany rehetra izany
And he was happy.	dia faly izy
He has always been like that at all times.	toy izany foana izy aminny fotoana rehetra
Another, he said to himself.	iray hafa hoy izy taminny tenany
If you haven’t been there yet, take a good look.	raha mbola tsy tonga tany ianao dia jereo tsara
Sometimes we both did.	indraindray izahay samy nanao
It’s really fun again.	tena mahafinaritra indray izany
Very close, but no, he was good.	tena akaiky fa tsia tsara izy
No question is too difficult, or too silly.	tsy misy fanontaniana sarotra loatra na adala loatra
Perhaps the almost impossible is more common now.	angamba ny saika tsy azo atao dia matetika kokoa izao
If they don’t have it, you don’t need it.	raha tsy manana izany izy ireo dia tsy mila izany ianao
So did mine.	dia nanao toy izany koa ny ahy
I did sort of.	nanao karazana aho
It was easier for me to think about it.	mora kokoa tamiko ny nieritreritra izany
So they found a way to him.	nahita lalana ho any aminy izy ireo noho izany
That seems to be enough for them.	toa ampy ho azy ireo izany
About the game, too.	momba ny lalao ihany koa
I have never seen better.	mbola tsy nahita tsara kokoa aho
Things are not the same down there.	tsy mitovy ny zavatra any ambany any
They become more than just ideas.	lasa mihoatra noho ny hevitra fotsiny izy ireo
That should be really big.	tokony ho lehibe tokoa izany
Maybe he loves her.	angamba izy tia azy
With everyone else.	miaraka aminny olona hafa rehetra
Then look around.	dia jereo ny manodidina
There is no such reason here.	tsy misy antony toy izany eto
But we need the money, he told himself.	mila ny vola anefa izahay hoy izy taminny tenany
It works in two ways.	izy io dia miasa aminny fomba roa
It doesn’t seem fun.	toa tsy mahafinaritra izany
So, not really.	noho izany tsy tena
The trip went perfectly.	nandeha tanteraka ny dia
And you can too.	ary azonao atao koa
But not like that, no.	fa tsy toy izany tsia

And life is.	ary ny fiainana dia
He could see me.	afaka nahita ahy izy
My favorite place.	toerana tiako indrindra
The best thing.	ny zavatra tsara indrindra
However, this is not the only option.	na izany aza tsy izany ihany no safidy

They went better.	nandeha tsara kokoa izy ireo
I am not with you.	tsy miaraka aminao aho
The latter was nothing.	tsy nisy na inona na inona ity farany
I love this thing.	tiako io zavatra io
This is where we are.	ity ny toerana misy antsika
I think they are wrong.	heveriko fa diso izy ireo
It’s still not too bad, but it will be.	mbola tsy dia ratsy loatra izany fa ho izany
Male to male to male.	lehilahy lehilahy ho anny lehilahy lehilahy
We looked but did not see.	nijery ihany izahay fa tsy nahita
This can be the fun part.	ity dia mety ho ampahany mahafinaritra
Just bad.	ratsy fotsiny
He is always alone.	irery foana izy
But life is not that simple.	saingy tsy dia tsotra toy izany ny fiainana
Maybe life itself.	angamba ny fiainana mihitsy
Although kind of pretty.	na dia karazana tsara tarehy aza
All is well now.	tsara daholo izao
That is what life is all about.	izany no atao hoe fiainana
Very little money.	tena kely ny vola
He should have gone alone.	tokony nandeha irery izy
Now it’s a good game for him.	aminizao fotoana izao dia lalao tsara ho azy
You seem to have.	toa manana ianao
They are together again.	miaraka indray izy ireo
But we can do more.	mbola afaka manao zavatra betsaka kokoa anefa isika
And so it has to.	ary noho izany dia tsy maintsy
Doesn't work for more images.	tsy miasa ho anny sary bebe kokoa
The negative result is everything.	ny vokatra ratsy dia ny zavadrehetra
Finally, finally.	farany farany ihany
Sometimes it’s good.	indraindray dia tsara
Or they don’t seem to be.	na toa tsy izy ireo
And we could see.	ary afaka nahita izahay
It could be beautiful.	mety ho tsara tarehy
He soon found himself in serious trouble.	tsy ela dia nahita olana lehibe izy
No one wants to do anything to you.	tsy misy olona te hanao na inona na inona aminao
There is no past, no future.	tsy misy lasa tsy misy ho avy
First of all, it can be a trivial matter.	voalohany mety ho zavatra tsy misy dikany izany
In fact, he has many such stories.	raha ny marina manana tantara maro toy izany izy
However, no one can do that.	na izany aza tsy misy afaka manao izany
I needed to do that.	nila nanao izany aho
Everyone down there.	ny olona rehetra any ambany any
We see nothing.	tsy mahita na inona na inona izahay
Not a better person.	tsy olona tsara kokoa
I deserve to be worse maybe.	mendrika ho ratsy kokoa angamba aho
Very much so.	tena betsaka tokoa
I just know this isn’t the end, not yet.	fantatro fotsiny fa tsy izao no farany tsy mbola
I need to see that sooner.	mila mahita izany aloha kokoa aho
Really because you started it.	tena satria ianao no nanomboka
Some don’t like anything from above.	ny sasany tsy tia na inona na inona avy any ambony
Enough land.	ampy ny tany
There is still a lot going on in it today.	mbola betsaka ny zavatra tonga ao aminy ankehitriny

It was another day.	andro hafa izany
Top action.	hetsika ambony indrindra
Which is right for you.	izay mety aminao
I didn't have a car.	tsy nanana fiara
There is a story now.	misy tantara izao
I don’t even look at them.	tsy mijery azy ireo akory aho
You are here now.	eo ianao izao
In fact, no problem.	raha ny marina dia tsy misy olana
That sounds bad, good.	toa ratsy izany tsara
You, of course, are far below that.	ianao mazava ho azy dia ambany lavitra noho izany
The story is the same.	toy izany koa ny tantara
But there are many other problems.	saingy mbola misy olana maro hafa
But a lot of money.	fa ny vola be dia be
In fact, time no longer mattered.	raha ny tena izy dia tsy nisy dikany intsony ny fotoana
These are the most fun.	ireo no tena mahafinaritra
For step two,.	ho anny dingana roa
Everyone is working hard on these issues.	miasa mafy aminireo olana ireo ny rehetra
I’m fast but not as fast as he is.	haingana aho fa tsy haingana toa azy
Because people expect you to be something you are not.	satria ny olona dia manantena anao ho zavatra tsy ianao

It may make sense, it may not.	mety misy dikany mety tsy
It’s not one thing or another.	tsy zavatra iray na hafa izany
Kind of common.	karazana mahazatra

I didn’t really think about it at all.	tsy dia nieritreritra loatra izany mihitsy
But I didn't need him.	tsy nila azy anefa aho
I needed to do it right.	nila nanao izany tsara aho
He started saying things to me.	nanomboka nilaza zavatra tamiko izy
They weren’t always there.	tsy nisy foana izy ireo
That is clear.	mazava izany
Someone had to tell me about me.	tsy maintsy nisy olona nilaza tamiko momba ahy

You don't understand him.	tsy azonao izy
This is a one -time thing.	zavatra indray mandeha ihany ity
There is no such person.	tsy misy olona toy izany

Or a little more.	na mihoatra kely
And there are many more.	ary mbola misy maro hafa koa
Surely he knew they were watching him.	azo antoka fa fantany fa nijery azy izy ireo
He looked down.	nijery ambany izy
Not available.	tsy azo
They are there again, he thought.	mbola eo indray izy ireo hoy izy nieritreritra
Thank you, actually.	misaotra anao raha ny marina
But we can do better than that.	afaka manao tsara kokoa noho izany anefa isika
And walk at night.	ary mandeha aminny alina
No one has ever had it.	tsy mbola nisy olona nanana izany
It is dead.	efa maty izy io
When you know that, it goes well.	rehefa fantatrao izany dia mandeha tsara
Especially since he had just seen her.	indrindra fa vao nahita azy izy

This is exactly the same of course.	izany dia mitovy tsara mazava ho azy
And that could be a really good thing.	ary mety ho zavatra tena tsara izany
The highest.	ny ambony indrindra
The first idea is meaningless.	ny hevitra voalohany dia tsy misy dikany

It has always been and always will be.	efa nisy foana izany ary mbola hisy foana

No one was around.	tsy nisy olona teo akaiky teo
He is not even like you.	tsy mitovy aminao akory izy

That’s worth it, if true.	izany no mendrika izany raha marina
A lot of pointless work.	asa be tsy misy dikany
He’s not ugly at all.	tsy ratsy tarehy izy na inona na inona
For fast cars only.	ho anny fiara mandeha haingana ihany
What is more appropriate.	inona no mety kokoa
I'm going fast again.	mandeha haingana indray aho
Good and thank you.	tsara ary misaotra

Each day goes by very fast.	ny andro tsirairay dia mandeha haingana be
He needed it for two reasons.	nila izany izy noho ny antony roa
That's enough.	ampy izay izany rehetra izany
So it takes a little time.	noho izany dia mila fotoana kely
He came, but not well.	tonga izy fa tsy tsara
I might not be happy about that.	mety tsy ho faly aminizany aho
And it’s a good life.	ary fiainana tsara izany
We really enjoyed the food.	tena nahafinaritra anay ny sakafo
They are still low in fact.	mbola ambany ihany izy ireo raha ny marina
There is so much more than that.	mbola betsaka kokoa noho izany

This is my favorite thing.	io no zavatra tiako indrindra

Work on it.	miasa aminizany
It just got easier.	lasa mora kokoa izany
But only once each of them.	fa indray mandeha ihany ny tsirairay aminizy ireo

You completely follow the real world.	manaraka tanteraka ny tontolo tena izy ianao
There is something wrong with this picture.	misy zavatra tsy mety aminity sary ity
I need you to come as soon as you can.	mila anao ho avy haingana araka izay azonao atao aho
So to me it goes well.	ka amiko dia mandeha tsara ilay izy
Still not enough, though.	mbola tsy ampy fa
That seems true, but it’s not going to happen.	toa marina izany saingy tsy ho tanteraka izany
And he had thought of her.	ary efa nieritreritra azy izy
The last two.	ny roa farany indrindra
He is bad for women.	ratsy aminny vehivavy izy
Evil is real.	tena misy ny ratsy

It soon came.	tsy ela dia tonga izany
It’s hard to go it alone.	sarotra ny mandeha irery
But this is not the end.	tsy izao anefa no farany
He is often alone.	irery izy matetika
He will come here again.	ho avy eto indray izy
Everything seemed bigger to me.	ny zavatra rehetra dia toa lehibe kokoa tamiko
Don’t look too far.	aza mijery lavitra
Sometimes they die.	maty izy ireo indraindray
It was an old life.	fiainana taloha izany
If they don’t.	raha tsy manao izany izy ireo
But nothing else.	saingy tsy misy hafa
Now that is not possible.	ankehitriny dia tsy azo atao izany
A very difficult question.	fanontaniana sarotra tokoa
I hope you like it.	manantena aho fa ho tianao izany
Different, and very good.	hafa ary tena tsara
I love seeing people do fun things.	tiako ny mahita olona manao zavatra mahafinaritra
But everyone can do two things.	saingy afaka manao zavatra roa ny tsirairay
I can't be alone.	tsy afaka irery aho
We did nothing.	tsy nanao na inona na inona izahay
He lost it.	very izany izy
They are very important.	tena ilaina izy ireo
Here, in this house, here we are.	eto aminity trano ity eto izahay
Every game is different.	samy hafa ny lalao rehetra
Either way, the fact is he never came.	na izany na tsy izany ny zavamisy dia tsy tonga mihitsy izy
I don't see you either.	tsy mahita anao koa aho
There was no other choice for him.	tsy nisy safidy hafa ho azy
I just think you’re fun.	heveriko fotsiny fa mahafinaritra ianao
He didn’t want to lose that job.	tsy te ho very io asa io izy
Maybe the man isn’t so nice anymore.	angamba tsy dia mahafinaritra intsony ilay lehilahy
I'm not like me.	tsy mitovy amiko aho
It seems so maybe.	toa izany angamba
It was all so much fun.	tena nahafinaritra ny rehetra
But none of these are true for me personally.	saingy tsy misy marina amiko manokana ireo
It may be time.	mety ho fotoana izao
That may not be true.	tsy mety marina izany
People finally arrived.	tonga ihany ny olona taminny farany
Not easy.	tsy mora
I am one of them.	iray aminizy ireo aho
We just don’t see.	tsy mahita fotsiny isika
And maybe that’s the idea.	ary angamba izay no hevitra
They are the worst.	izy ireo no ratsy indrindra
Then go with each one.	avy eo dia mandeha aminny tsirairay
We all need more money.	mila vola bebe kokoa isika rehetra
That’s all you really need to know.	izay ihany no tena tokony ho fantatrao
And he needs you.	ary mila anao izy
He looked at himself.	nijery ny tenany izy
And we don’t want to do that.	ary tsy te hanao izany izahay
I had to look at you.	tsy maintsy nijery anao aho
There are many days to come.	misy andro maro ho avy
This is how it used to be.	toy izany ny taloha
He never said he did.	tsy nilaza mihitsy hoe nanao izany
I am also very fast.	tena haingana koa aho
It has always been like this.	efa toy izao foana
He didn't stay long.	tsy nijanona ela izy
Or what they are.	na hoe inona izy ireo
I want us all to be there.	tiako ho any daholo isika rehetra
They are both women.	samy vehivavy ireo
Maybe it won’t be easy.	angamba tsy ho mora izany
They are important to him.	zavadehibe aminy izy ireo
This is also very difficult for us.	tena sarotra ho antsika koa izany
He may have never seen it before.	mety mbola tsy nahita mihitsy izy taloha
It was not even found.	tsy hita akory ilay izy
It’s been too long for others.	efa ela loatra izany ho anny hafa
Only one way.	lalana iray ihany
And so do the people around you.	ary toy izany koa ny olona manodidina anao
Others follow.	manaraka izany ny hafa
Look at that money.	jereo io vola io
There shouldn’t be.	tsy tokony hisy
Others, too.	ny hafa koa
It doesn’t get much better.	tsy tsara kokoa izany
I have seen him there.	efa hitako tany izy
He could not have thought of them that way.	tsy afaka nieritreritra azy ireo toy izany izy
But the problem here is timing.	fa ny olana eto dia ny fotoana
The image at the front end is also missing now.	ny sary eo aminny farany aloha dia tsy hita koa ankehitriny
This man.	ity lehilahy ity
They are people like you and me.	olona toa ahy sy ianao izy ireo
It could go a long way.	mety ho lasa lavitra izany
In fact, these things never exist.	raha ny tena marina dia tsy misy mihitsy ireo zavatra ireo
And we got there.	ary tonga any izahay
These are very real facts.	tena zavamisy marina ireo
It said.	hoy izy io
I did that.	nanao izany aho
But it’s a big story.	saingy tantara lehibe izany
There is nothing wrong with that.	tsy misy tokony ho diso
Like, in fact.	toy ny raha ny tena izy
It's a beautiful place.	toerana tsara tarehy io
I have the picture.	manana ny sary aho
So what is it.	dia inona izany
It was all fun.	nahafinaritra izany rehetra izany
They are older than we are.	be taona kokoa noho isika izy ireo
You will always be there.	hisy ihany ianao
This is almost certainly true.	saika marina ihany izany
And the problem is big.	ary lehibe ny olana
And that’s even better.	ary tsara kokoa izany
You can do better.	afaka manao zavatra tsara kokoa ianao
However, nothing is as simple as that.	na izany aza tsy misy zavatra tsotra toy izany
The work is yours.	anao ny asa
It’s a bit difficult.	somary sarotra ihany
You get it with a lot of information.	mahazo izany ianao miaraka aminireo vaovao be dia be
Too big there.	lehibe loatra tany
However, it is not worth the idea.	na izany aza tsy mendrika izany hevitra izany
It almost seems too good if not true.	saika toa tsara loatra raha tsy marina
There was a lot of fighting.	betsaka ny ady
Certainly difficult.	azo antoka fa sarotra
He is a very special man.	lehilahy tena manokana izy
More than enough, he said.	mihoatra noho ny ampy hoy izy
The story begins here.	manomboka eto ny tantara
It is very low.	tena ambany izy io
This is generally not true.	tsy marina izany aminny ankapobeny
That is for us.	izany no ho antsika
We do it all together.	miaraka manao izany rehetra izany izahay
Because of a man.	noho ny lehilahy iray
And then what.	ary avy eo inona
Of course, everyone is different.	mazava ho azy fa samy hafa ny tsirairay
There was no way.	tsy nisy lalana
But none of them work.	tsy misy miasa anefa izy ireo
He made them.	izy no nanao azy ireo
Draw it.	ataovy sary izany
Then put it in it.	dia ataovy ao anatiny izy
He, himself.	izy ny tenany
I have to get a bigger one now.	tsy maintsy mahazo iray lehibe kokoa aho izao
Everyone loves us.	tia antsika ny rehetra
So, a lot can be done.	noho izany be dia be ny azo atao
The process begins again.	manomboka indray ny dingana
You can't do that.	tsy azonao atao izany
Which is what matters most.	izay zavadehibe ny zavadrehetra
If something goes wrong, you never get there.	raha misy tsy mety dia tsy tonga any mihitsy ianao
I just get them.	mahazo azy ireo fotsiny aho
You are beautiful, they say.	tsara tarehy ianao hoy izy ireo
But not many did.	tsy dia maro loatra anefa no nanao izany
And that doesn’t seem like a bad idea.	ary toa tsy hevitra ratsy izany
But the pictures are not enough.	saingy tsy ampy ny sary
But that may be true.	mety ho marina anefa izany
Thanks again for seeing you.	misaotra indray mahita anao
I can't look at him.	tsy afaka mijery azy aho
In everything.	aminny zavatra rehetra
No one saw him either.	tsy nisy nahita azy koa
It will become one thing or everything else.	ho lasa zavatra iray na zavatra hafa rehetra izany
It also plays an important role in this.	manao asa lehibe aminizany koa izy io
The trip was really fun.	tena nahafinaritra ny dia
With people who work longer.	miaraka aminny olona miasa ela kokoa
He went away and saw something.	lasa lavitra izy ary nahita zavatra
This is the biggest year.	io no taona lehibe indrindra
Some people are still dead.	mbola misy olona maty
Everything in it, all these big parts.	ny zavatra rehetra ao ireo ampahany lehibe rehetra ireo
He didn't want to do anything.	tsy te hanao na inona na inona izy
I thought, really.	nieritreritra aho hoe tena marina
You walk away with nothing.	mandeha tsy misy zavatra ianao
Usually this is a good thing.	raha ny mahazatra dia zavatra tsara izany
Not kind of looking at it.	tsy karazana mijery azy
But it looks good.	toa tsara anefa izany
And we need the money.	ary mila ny vola izahay
No one ever did.	tsy nisy nanao izany mihitsy
If you want to do that.	raha te hanao izany ianao
Maybe he had thought of them far and wide.	angamba efa nieritreritra azy ireo lavitra izy
That is not the real problem.	tsy izany no tena olana
No one liked him, but there.	tsy nisy olona tia azy fa teo
Sometimes it’s special.	indraindray dia manokana izany
I was crazy not to see it.	adala aho tsy nahita anio
But you said no.	fa hoy ianao hoe tsia
The real thing is the person.	ny tena izy dia ilay olona
Not the usual either.	tsy ny mahazatra ihany koa
But there were many.	saingy nisy maro
See if he can still walk.	jereo raha mbola afaka mandeha izy
But life is not easy for them.	tsy mora ho azy ireo anefa ny fiainana
They can be pretty safe.	mety ho azo antoka tsara izy ireo
They never do that.	tsy manao izany mihitsy izy ireo
It’s very difficult and can be a long way off.	tena sarotra izany ary mety ho lavitra
As long as he loves her, she will be for him.	raha mbola tiany izy dia ho azy izy
There are many reasons.	misy antony maro
So look around.	ka jereo ny manodidina
He was now happy with himself.	faly taminny tenany izy izao
But it's yours.	fa anao izany
There’s more, but you get the idea.	misy bebe kokoa fa azonao ny hevitra
He said he was wrong.	nilaza izy fa diso
That is, it is not a bad thing at all.	izany hoe tsy zavatra ratsy mihitsy izany
The war so.	ny ady ka
I don’t really like this one.	tsy dia tiako loatra ity
But he kept saying.	mbola nilaza anefa izy
There’s a great story here.	misy tantara lehibe eto
I want you to do it to be real again.	tiako ianao hanao izany mba ho lasa tena indray
But the story is much bigger than that.	saingy lehibe lavitra noho izany ny tantara
I have never seen two crazy people like that.	tsy mbola nahita olona roa adala toy izany aho
That way, if it works, fine.	aminizany fomba izany raha miasa tsara
Often far higher.	matetika ambony lavitra
Everything has been going well lately.	nandeha tsara ny zavadrehetra vao haingana
There is no such news now.	tsy misy vaovao toy izany ankehitriny
Nothing is far from the truth.	tsy misy zavatra lavitra ny zavamisy
Or with him.	na miaraka aminy
He was moving faster now.	nandeha haingana kokoa izy izao
The car runs better than usual.	mandeha tsara kokoa noho ny mahazatra ny fiara
I only saw a little bit.	somary kely ihany no hitako
It should be faster.	tokony ho haingana kokoa izany
But that is not certain.	saingy tsy azo antoka izany
And there is one more thing.	ary misy zavatra iray hafa
At first, 'he said.	taminny voalohany hoy izy
it is too low.	ambany loatra izany
That, and nothing else.	izany ary tsy misy hafa
Start doing that.	manomboka manao toy izany
And that's it.	ary efa izay
We always come first and that is very important.	tonga voalohany foana izahay ary tena zavadehibe izany
We both stopped.	samy nijanona izahay
Nor is it very good.	tsy izany koa no tena tsara
But he will be there.	fa ho eo izy
So you can do more than that.	noho izany dia afaka mihoatra noho izany ianao
Need to have one.	mila manana iray
I love you now.	tiako ianao izao
That’s really a lot.	tena betsaka tokoa izany
Of course, the woman was crazy.	mazava ho azy fa adala ilay vehivavy
What could be wrong with him.	mba inona no mety tsy mety aminy
The former is immediate.	ny teo aloha dia avy hatrany
To a woman.	aminny vehivavy iray
It was really good, it was fun.	tena tsara izany nahafinaritra
But there are many here.	saingy maro no eto
Not us and neither are we.	tsy isika ary izy roa
Not really like that.	tsy tena toy izany
Maybe, more in the future.	angamba mbola bebe kokoa aminny ho avy
I'm just not happy.	tsy faly fotsiny aho
He did it for her.	izy no nanao izany ho azy
He knew he needed it too.	fantany fa nila izany koa izy
They’re just different, don’t go too far.	hafa ihany izy ireo aza mandeha tsara loatra
I love cars, men, beautiful cars.	tiako ny fiara lehilahy fiara tsara tarehy
To me, this seems wrong, but it’s not certain.	amiko dia toa diso izany saingy tsy azo antoka
But these are not all at once.	tsy indray mandeha anefa ireo
So yes, we have come a long way.	ka eny efa tonga lavitra isika
We have to start with.	tsy maintsy manomboka aminny
There is so much that can be done.	be dia be ny azo atao
Both of these cars still exist.	samy mbola misy ireo fiara ireo
It may also be low.	mety ho ambany koa izany
I am a different person now.	olona hafa aho izao
Bigger and better.	lehibe sy tsara kokoa
These are unhappy people.	olona tsy faly ireo
For him, he could have done it.	ho azy dia afaka nanao izany izy
I know that sounds silly but it’s just the truth.	fantatro fa toa adala izany fa ny marina fotsiny
And never will.	ary tsy hanao izany mihitsy
I always want to do something.	te hanao zavatra foana aho
I would have been completely lost without him.	very tanteraka aho raha tsy nisy azy
This is a big problem for two reasons.	olana lehibe izany noho ny antony roa
The full story can be found here.	hita eto ny tantara feno
Still, the results are excellent.	mbola vokatra tena tsara anefa
You are the most wonderful.	mahafinaritra indrindra ianao
Stupid question.	fanontaniana adala
He might like it.	mety ho tiany izany
There is a way.	misy lalana
I think we are the same.	heveriko fa mitovy isika
I have two products.	manana vokatra roa aho
You almost died last time.	saika maty ianao taminny fotoana farany
The weather is bad.	ratsy ny andro
If you don’t start, you don’t do anything.	raha tsy manomboka dia tsy manao na inona na inona
But that may not always be the case.	mety tsy ho toy izany foana anefa izany
That really isn’t the problem anymore.	tena tsy izany intsony no olana
I have another story.	manana tantara hafa aho
Thanks for all the food.	misaotra aminny sakafo rehetra
I’m dying to see it.	maty aho mahita izany
I saw this.	hitako ity
You have to expect that.	tsy maintsy manantena izany ianao
They are everywhere now.	eny rehetra eny izy ireo ankehitriny
I was able to go on a trip.	afaka nandeha taminny dia aho
He himself thought so.	izy mihitsy no nieritreritra izany
But this is not complete.	tsy feno anefa izany
He likes it very little.	kely dia kely no tiany
Sometimes that’s all it takes.	indraindray dia izany ihany no ilaina
Now, it’s about life.	ankehitriny momba ny fiainana izy
Be very clear.	ataovy mazava tsara
If you have one, you probably already know it.	raha manana iray ianao dia mety efa fantatrao izany
Because they are small.	satria kely izy ireo
Not much needed for a day trip.	tsy dia ilaina loatra aminny dia iray andro
This one, however, is less visible.	ity iray ity anefa dia tsy dia hita loatra
To come to you.	mba ho tonga aminao
He looked at the man on the floor.	nijery ilay lehilahy teo aminny tany izy
I am a special man though.	lehilahy manokana aho na izany aza

But you know very well now.	fa fantatrao tsara izao

It works properly right now.	miasa tsara araka ny tokony ho izy aminizao fotoana izao
Yes, no, not in general.	eny tsia tsy aminny ankapobeny
The facts are very clear.	mazava be ny zavamisy
He used to.	izy taloha
But we have a fact.	manana zavamisy anefa isika
Very important person.	olona tena lehibe
I have never seen him do this before.	mbola tsy nahita azy nanao toy izao aho
Neither was anyone.	samy tsy nisy olona
Look at the people around you.	jereo ny olona manodidina anao
I didn’t get anything then.	tsy nahazo na inona na inona aho taminizany
Some are great.	ny sasany dia lehibe
But this is something else.	saingy zavatra hafa ity
Maybe, now, it’s gone.	angamba ankehitriny dia tsy misy intsony

The best option would be.	ny safidy tsara indrindra dia ho
I know what has to be done.	fantatro izay tsy maintsy atao

But not because of him.	fa tsy noho izy
But you.	ianao anefa
The first day of life for me is new.	ny andro voalohany aminny fiainana ho ahy vaovao
That’s always been the case.	izany no nijanona foana
Soon, if you do it often, it will come naturally.	tsy ho ela raha manao izany matetika ianao dia ho tonga ho azy
No one is barren.	tsy misy olona momba
But other times it doesn’t work.	saingy aminny fotoana hafa dia tsy mandeha izany
It’s still worth it.	mbola mendrika izany
I know that's not possible.	fantatro fa tsy azo atao izany
He walks in a variety of ways.	mandeha aminny karazana lalana izy
If they did, we can do the same.	raha nanao izany izy ireo dia afaka manao izany koa isika
I love when things like that go.	tiako rehefa mandeha ny zavatra toy izany
I know you too.	fantatro koa ianao
He looked down before he could stop.	nijery ambany izy vao afaka nijanona
Different parts of a world and different types.	ampahany tsy mitovy aminny tontolo iray ary samy hafa karazana
He does it when he walks.	manao izany izy rehefa mandeha
She was a big little woman.	vehivavy kely lehibe izy
It didn’t really seem to happen.	toa tsy tena nisy izany
They shouldn’t have done it.	tsy tokony ho nanao izany izy ireo
It really seems important to me.	tena toa zavadehibe amiko
Because it’s so good and so fast.	satria tsara dia tsara ary haingana dia haingana
It was a real night.	tena alina izany
You know, more importantly.	fantatrao ny zavadehibe kokoa
Some you will like and others you won’t.	ny sasany dia ho tianao ary ny hafa tsy
What is true to you is only true to you.	izay marina aminao dia marina aminao ihany
It was fun for them all.	nahafinaritra azy rehetra izany
This is all true.	marina daholo izany
Not so much for me, but for them.	tsy dia betsaka loatra amiko fa ho azy ireo
He died two years ago.	maty izy roa taona lasa izay
They seem real.	toa tena misy izy ireo
You shouldn’t expect too much from me.	tsy tokony manantena be loatra amiko ianao
You can make whatever money you want.	afaka manao izay vola tianao ianao
Someone needs it.	misy mila azy
He still loves you, just as he still loves you.	mbola tia anao izy toy ny mbola tia anao
It was fun, house.	nahafinaritra ilay izy trano
But you don’t want to be here.	saingy tsy te ho eto ianao
He was probably a little too sure of himself.	somary azo antoka loatra ny tenany angamba
Maybe he had the right idea.	angamba izy nanana ny hevitra mety
However, they still seem familiar.	na izany aza dia mbola toa mahazatra ihany izy ireo
So he simply won’t do it.	noho izany dia tsy hanao izany tsotra izao izy
He is such a person.	olona toy izany izy
Someone else was already there.	efa nisy olona hafa teo
Life went on.	nandeha ny fiainana
And there was.	ary nisy
I think he wants you to be like this.	heveriko fa tiany ho toy izao ianao
Soon everything will be fine again.	tsy ho ela dia ho tsara indray ny zavadrehetra
Not a game.	tsy lalao
Everything is better.	tsara kokoa ny zavadrehetra
The best time has come.	tonga izao ny fotoana tsara indrindra
It’s something in the world.	zavatra eo aminizao tontolo izao izany
When you know what you want.	rehefa fantatrao izay tianao
He is always here too.	eto foana koa izy
And it really isn't.	ary tsy izany tokoa
He said we can have many years.	nilaza izy fa afaka manana taona maro isika
But what seems difficult is very simple.	saingy ny zavatra toa sarotra dia tena tsotra
We are there, and we are history.	isika no tany ary isika no tantara
This is a little different.	hafa kely ity
It’s all men.	lehilahy daholo izany
No, not like us.	tsy izany tsy toy ny antsika
Have a little time, do it.	manana fotoana kely ataovy izany
Both days went by.	samy nandeha ny andro

He didn't have time.	tsy nanana fotoana izy
Everything about them is true.	marina daholo ny momba azy ireo
He wanted me to be beautiful.	tiany ho tsara tarehy aho
Good and good, but no more.	tsara sy tsara fa tsy mihoatra
You are from before.	avy teo aloha ianao
Not in the right way.	tsy aminny tena lalana
It is as big as the universe.	lehibe toy izao rehetra izao izy io
However, you know it’s a more difficult task.	na izany aza fantatrao fa asa sarotra kokoa izany
I had never thought like that before.	tsy mbola nieritreritra toy izany mihitsy aho taloha
Or as before.	na toy ny taloha
I don’t know anything about them.	tsy fantatro na inona na inona momba azy ireo
There really wasn’t one.	tsy nisy marina na dia iray aza
It seems like another fun time.	toa fotoana mahafinaritra hafa izany
Always see me.	mahita ahy foana
So it was a really fun time.	noho izany dia fotoana tena nahafinaritra
That's the way it is said.	izany no fomba nilaza izany
Although not for long.	na dia tsy ela aza
It doesn't work anymore.	tsy mety izany intsony
Because they still need me.	satria mbola mila ahy
The car looks lower than usual.	toa ambany noho ny mahazatra ilay fiara
Sooner or later it will happen.	na ho ela na ho haingana dia hisy izany
That is tonight.	izany hoe anio alina
It will be almost no war.	saika tsy hisy ady izany
Or more, of course.	na mihoatra mazava ho azy
There is absolutely nothing like it.	tena tsy misy toa azy mihitsy
A wonderful life, there are many wonderful people in it.	fiainana mahafinaritra misy olona mahafinaritra maro ao anatiny
But the kind of crazy good.	saingy ilay karazana adala tsara
Maybe that’s a big deal.	angamba zavatra lehibe izany
And it’s not enough to see him.	ary tsy ampy ny nahita azy
I had the best time.	nanana fotoana tsara indrindra aho
If you’re not stupid, it won’t be the end.	raha tsy adala ianao dia tsy ho farany izany
Yes, he used to, though.	eny izy taloha na izany aza
There is no better place either.	tsy misy toerana tsara kokoa koa
It is visible.	hita izany
We are not what we used to be.	tsy toy ny taloha intsony isika
That’s how we enjoyed it.	toy izany no nahafinaritra anay
Something like that is important.	zavadehibe ny zavatra toy izany
Didn't do it.	tsy nanao izany
It may not be the end.	mety tsy ho farany io
I will never be free.	tsy ho afaka mihitsy aho
He will never love again.	tsy ho tia intsony izy
Almost no one.	saika tsy misy olona
It’s even better than the others.	mbola tsara kokoa noho ny hafa izany
He knew he was close.	fantany fa akaiky izy
No one is watching us.	tsy misy mijery anay
We are theirs.	isika no azy ireo
Especially like that.	indrindra fa toy izany
He is a very special person.	olona tena manokana izy
It’s almost worth it.	saika mendrika izany
We have to do something.	tsy maintsy manao zavatra isika
But time will not come quickly.	saingy tsy ho haingana ny fotoana
Thank you for everything.	misaotra anao aminny rehetra
I have a question.	manana fanontaniana aho
In fact, it’s harder than it deserves.	raha ny marina dia sarotra kokoa noho izay mendrika izany
Or maybe next year.	na mety ny taona manaraka izany
He didn’t want her to come.	tsy tiany ho avy izy
The trip must have been fun.	tsy maintsy ho nahafinaritra ilay dia
Surely that is what he wanted.	azo antoka fa izany no tiany
Or it may come next year.	na mety ho tonga aminny taona manaraka
He seems far away.	toa lavitra izy
We don't see him anymore.	tsy mahita azy intsony izahay
He had no action for him.	tsy nanana hetsika ho azy izy
And bigger.	ary lehibe kokoa
Not yet good, but better.	tsy mbola tsara fa tsara kokoa
We need a secure job.	mila asa azo antoka izahay
In fact, you know all the stories.	raha ny marina fantatrao daholo ny tantara
He has always known that.	efa fantany foana izany
However, this can be easily done.	na izany aza azo atao mora foana izany
I think many are with you.	heveriko fa maro no miaraka aminao
Probably the least of the best.	angamba kely indrindra aminny tsara indrindra
Then there are many of us.	dia maro izahay
If you don’t know what it should be.	raha tsy fantatrao hoe inona izany dia tokony
Each day is a little different.	samy hafa kely ny andro tsirairay
And that is absolutely true.	ary marina tanteraka izany
This method is better.	tsara kokoa izany fomba izany
It did, and it still does.	nanao izany ary mbola manao izany
He did not want to be alone.	tsy te ho irery akory izy
All methods are very accurate and fast.	ny fomba rehetra dia tena marina sy haingana
That’s a long way off.	tena lavitra izany
You have to do it alone.	tsy maintsy manao izany irery ianao
I'm at the end.	eo aminny farany aho
This can be made more clearly.	azo atao mazava kokoa izany
It could not have happened.	tsy mety ho nisy izany
Then more questions.	avy eo fanontaniana bebe kokoa
And this one has.	ary ity dia manana
It might go crazy down there.	mety ho lasa adala any ambany any
Of course you can.	mazava ho azy fa afaka
And there are many like that.	ary misy olona maro toy izany
And then, he saw, and he couldn’t.	ary avy eo nahita izy ary tsy afaka
This thing is good.	tsara ity zavatra ity
The path itself, however, is not important.	ny lalana mihitsy anefa dia tsy zavadehibe
I haven’t always found anything safe.	tsy nahita zavatra azo antoka foana aho
Women need money now.	mila vola ny vehivavy ankehitriny
The first picture.	ny sary voalohany
Otherwise, it’s not fun.	raha tsy izany dia tsy mahafinaritra
It was almost timeless.	saika tsy nisy fotoana mihitsy izany
Because you are beautiful.	satria tsara tarehy ianao
You don't need it.	tsy mila izany
Now it’s going to be important.	izao dia ho zavadehibe izany
This is where I am.	ity no toerana misy ahy
And some did.	ary nanao izany ny sasany
Do it now, if possible.	ataovy izao raha azo atao
I really will.	tena hanao aho
It should be really fun to do that.	tokony ho tena mahafinaritra ny manao izany
Maybe, for once, they were human.	angamba indray mandeha dia olona izy ireo
And he said yes.	dia hoy izy hoe eny
This is the most appropriate option.	ity no safidy mety indrindra
There was a problem with this one.	nisy olana ity iray ity
These are completely different questions.	fanontaniana samy hafa tanteraka ireo
Now all that is lost.	ankehitriny dia very izany rehetra izany
There are other options as well.	misy safidy hafa koa any
One word first.	teny iray aloha
Which is a bit different.	izay somary hafa
You have to expect that in battle.	tsy maintsy manantena izany ianao aminny ady
Or at the right time in life.	na aminny fotoana mety aminny fiainana
At first he didn’t think so.	taminny voalohany dia tsy nieritreritra izy
These people are usually women.	matetika dia vehivavy ireo olona ireo
But he knew that was not entirely true.	saingy fantany fa tsy marina tanteraka izany
He expects us to love everyone.	manantena antsika ho tia ny olona rehetra izy
I didn't need to look at him again.	tsy nila nijery azy indray aho
However, this is not uncommon.	tsy dia mahazatra loatra anefa izany
Life today is wonderful.	tena mahafinaritra ny fiainana ankehitriny
Tough and beautiful !.	mafy sy tsara tarehy
Here is the future.	eto ny ho avy
Here is the fact.	izao ny zavamisy
They are doing stupid things.	manao zavatra adala izy ireo
Like, yes.	toy ny hoe eny
You will always be beautiful.	ho tsara tarehy foana ianao
It’s a little simple.	tsotra kely izany
It’s not that simple.	tsy tsotra izany
Well, if possible.	tsara raha azo atao
We are very much in agreement.	tena mitovy hevitra izahay
Just because you have to.	satria fotsiny hoe tsy maintsy
And of course it’s not.	ary mazava ho azy fa tsy izy io
Then come alone, or maybe with another man.	avy eo tonga irery na angamba miaraka aminny lehilahy hafa
But not mine.	fa tsy ny ahy
Look at him.	mijery azy
Otherwise, the two methods are almost identical.	raha tsy izany ny fomba roa dia saika mitovy
You do stupid things, you do other stupid things.	manao zavatra adala ianao manao zavatra adala hafa
There was a place for everyone.	nisy toerana ho anny olona rehetra
Didn't look at the big picture.	tsy nijery ny sary lehibe
I walk him.	mandeha azy aho
Good thing there was someone.	tsara fa nisy olona
But no one is like that.	fa tsy misy olona toy izany
She couldn't tell him.	tsy afaka nilaza taminy izy
But you know better.	fa fantatrao tsara kokoa
The day is always full when he is here.	feno foana ny andro rehefa eto izy
So, too wrong.	noho izany diso loatra
There are so many possibilities in the world.	betsaka ny mety eto aminizao tontolo izao
Not him, not now.	tsy izy tsy izao
It will be in the world.	ho eo aminizao tontolo izao izany
I'm not getting a job.	tsy mahazo asa aho
They can be very bad.	mety ho ratsy be izy ireo
So, the choice is good.	noho izany tsara ny safidy
But not in this game.	saingy tsy aminity lalao ity
Words are everything.	ny teny no zavadrehetra
But you need to know that.	tokony ho fantatrao anefa izany
We look forward to the same in the coming years.	manantena izany koa izahay aminny taona ho avy
Of course they do.	mazava ho azy fa manao izany izy ireo
Someone needs to do that work.	misy olona mila manao izany asa izany
You can do the same if you like.	afaka manao toy izany koa ianao raha tianao
No, not really.	tsia tsy izany tokoa
But that's because.	fa izany dia noho ny
And everyone has theirs.	ary samy manana ny azy ny tsirairay
They are two different words.	teny roa samy hafa izy ireo
I think they will do the same.	heveriko fa hanao toy izany koa izy ireo
He can do this in private life.	afaka manao izany aminny fiainana manokana izy
And there was still something about him.	ary mbola nisy zavatra momba azy
It could be anything.	mety ho na inona na inona izany
Some are just like that.	ny sasany dia tena toy izany
But it just doesn’t make sense.	saingy tsy misy dikany fotsiny izy
And that might just be a good thing.	ary mety ho zavatra tsara ihany izany
He loves to be honest.	tiany ny manao ny marina
Really, thank you.	tena marina misaotra
And everyone loves the first woman.	ary tia ny vehivavy voalohany ny rehetra
He said it was not possible.	nilaza izy fa tsy azo atao izany
Some special, some not so much.	ny sasany manokana ny sasany tsy dia be loatra
I just saw them.	vao nahita azy ireo aho
I also have a question.	manana fanontaniana koa aho
It just seems to come naturally.	toa tonga ho azy fotsiny izany
There is a big problem with that.	misy olana lehibe aminizany
But there is something.	saingy misy zavatra
In fact, it’s a good idea.	raha ny marina dia hevitra tsara izany
For all good reasons.	noho ny antony tsara daholo
He needs you.	mila anao izy
It makes perfect sense now.	misy dikany tanteraka izao
I’m really with you on that.	tena miaraka aminao aho aminizany
And again and again.	ary hatrany hatrany
There was still a lack.	mbola nisy tsy ampy
So he had time.	noho izany dia nanana fotoana izy
It’s as simple as possible.	tsotra araka izay azo atao izany
There is always something about him.	misy zavatra momba azy foana
Very alone.	tena irery
I find that wrong.	hitako fa tsy mety izany
And the story came.	ary tonga ny tantara
But there was no problem with the word.	tsy nisy olana anefa ilay teny
A world without it.	tontolo tsy nisy azy io
He works for you, he said.	miasa ho anao izy hoy izy
But she knew that she would never love him again.	fantany anefa fa tsy ho tia azy intsony izy
He has to go to work.	tsy maintsy mandeha miasa izy
The house is as usual.	toy ny mahazatra ilay trano
She will just love him.	ho tia azy fotsiny izy
Or he, therefore.	na izy noho izany
None of them are safe.	tsy misy azo antoka aminizy ireo
He will be something more, something more than that.	ho zavatra bebe kokoa izy zavatra mihoatra noho izany
He knew it had to be true.	fantany fa tsy maintsy marina izany
It’s not always good.	tsy tsara foana izany
And died.	ary maty
It makes sense now.	misy dikany izao
Keep it simple.	ataovy tsotra izany
This is a problem in many ways.	olana aminny fomba maro izany
He always did well.	nanao tsara foana izy
Yes, we both did.	eny samy nanao izany izahay
And he will do it again, he said.	ary mbola hanao izany indray izy hoy izy
Even though he knew it.	na dia fantany aza izany
Someone is always watching.	misy mijery foana
And it’s very unusual.	ary tena tsy mahazatra izany
It’s like you’ve found your place.	toy ny hoe nahita ny toerana misy anao ianao
But this is not the same as before.	tsy toy ny teo aloha anefa izany
It may be possible, but it may not be.	mety ho azo atao izany fa angamba tsy izany
You are a great woman.	vehivavy lehibe ianao
We’re not close, no matter what.	tsy akaiky izahay na inona na inona
So many people came.	betsaka tokoa ny olona tonga teo
I think you are right.	heveriko fa mety ianao
They are absolutely right.	marina tanteraka izy ireo
He had no money left.	tsy nanana vola intsony izy
And it’s always about history.	ary momba ny tantara foana izany
I should have gotten two.	tokony ho nahazo roa aho
And there is a reason.	ary misy antony
I totally disagree with you.	tsy mitovy hevitra aminao tanteraka
Because we don’t do it anymore.	satria tsy manao izany intsony izahay
Only once did he see her.	indray mandeha ihany fa nahita azy izy
You know this method very well.	fantatrao tsara io fomba io
But these are.	saingy ireo dia
A lot of it.	be dia be aminizany
It will always be fulfilled.	ho tanteraka foana izany
There was a war.	nisy ady
Everything is still good.	mbola tsara daholo
But they both stayed there.	saingy nijanona tao izy roa
There has been a special mention about it recently.	nisy manokana manokana momba izany vao haingana
Don’t go it alone.	aza mandeha irery
It doesn’t make sense or mean anything.	tsy misy dikany na dikany na inona na inona
And it certainly is.	ary azo antoka fa izany no izy
That word again.	io teny io indray
But from other movements, yes, they do.	saingy avy aminny hetsika hafa eny manao izany izy ireo
Yes, they made a lot of money.	eny nahazo vola be izy ireo
I think that could be it.	heveriko fa mety ho izany
Yes, you can.	eny azonao atao izany
And they kept coming.	dia tonga hatrany izy ireo
He must know why.	tsy maintsy fantany ny antony
It’s usually not just the two of us.	tsy izahay roa ihany no matetika
It’s a really fun thing to do.	tena zavatra mahafinaritra izany
She loves home.	tia trano izy
I don't know the real reason.	tsy fantatro ny antony marina
It may not be good but it works.	mety tsy tsara ilay izy fa miasa
I hope he will.	manantena aho fa hanao izany izy
It was as if he had to do something.	toy ny hoe tokony hanao zavatra izy
Of course, this is possible.	mazava ho azy fa azo natao izany
Full of action.	feno hetsika
It's dead now.	maty izao
Even the time is over.	na ny fotoana aza efa lasa
That’s for sure and it’s certainly true.	azo antoka izany ary azo antoka fa marina
So this is completely new.	ka dia vaovao tanteraka izany
Sure, you seem to be able to do that.	azo antoka fa toa afaka manao izany ianao
As before, no one has ever made this conversation.	toy ny teo aloha tsy mbola nisy olona nanao anio resaka io
I love the man.	tiako ilay lehilahy
It has always been.	efa foana
He is already crazy.	efa adala izy
The results are bad.	ratsy ny vokatra
Both seem to work.	toa samy miasa ireo roa ireo
Or, in fact, he saw them.	na raha ny marina dia nahita azy ireo izy
They are different ages.	samy hafa taona izy ireo
In another way.	aminny lalana hafa
that's for sure.	antoka izany
It didn't seem to matter anymore.	toa tsy nisy dikany intsony ilay izy
But it will come to pass.	fa ho tanteraka izany
He couldn't do that either.	tsy afaka nanao izany koa izy
I should have stopped at that.	tokony ho nijanona teo aminizany aho
Maybe more than one.	angamba mihoatra ny iray
It came to me.	tonga amiko izany
It can even be seen in action.	hita taminny asa mihitsy aza izany
Which seems to make sense.	izay toa misy dikany
At the time, there were many.	taminizany fotoana izany dia maro
This one is just a little different.	hafa kely fotsiny ity iray ity
What really matters is the results.	ny tena zavadehibe dia ny vokatra
I love them for that.	tiako izy ireo noho izany
That is exactly the idea.	izany indrindra no hevitra
Which is great.	izay lehibe
But I can't work.	saingy tsy afaka miasa aho
It’s just an idea.	hevitra ihany izany
At the time.	taminny fotoana
And that's all there is to it.	ary izay ihany no ao anatiny
One of them has to do it.	ny iray aminizy ireo dia tsy maintsy manao izany
It will not be the end either.	tsy ho farany koa izany
Yes, and there is real news, too, sometimes.	eny ary misy vaovao tena izy koa indraindray
Something else, in other words.	zavatra hafa aminny teny hafa
Not in general, however.	tsy aminny ankapobeny anefa
They are just wrong.	diso hevitra fotsiny izy ireo
It doesn't work anymore.	tsy mandeha intsony
Average game.	lalao eo ho eo
It may be one day.	mety ho indray andro izany
They can be bad.	mety ho ratsy izy ireo
The man kept looking at us.	nijery anay foana ilay lehilahy
We all had a great time.	nahafinaritra be izahay rehetra
Yes, part of me.	eny ampahany amiko
It’s a much simpler thing.	zavatra tsotra kokoa izany
Maybe the world.	angamba izao tontolo izao
Something is always missing.	misy zavatra tsy ampy foana
No one works harder than him.	tsy misy miasa mafy noho izy
Something just for you.	zavatra ho anao fotsiny
This is the unreal thing.	izany no zavatra tsy tena izy
They are not just beautiful.	tsy tsara tarehy fotsiny izy ireo
And in spite of all this, you came.	ary na dia teo aza izany rehetra izany dia tonga ianao
The surrounding situation is the same.	mitovy ihany ny zavamisy manodidina
That place did not come to him easily.	tsy tonga taminy mora izany toerana izany
There is little that can be done for them.	kely ny azo atao ho azy ireo
It’s really not you.	tena tsy ianao ilay izy
He couldn't look down.	tsy afaka nijery ambany izy
But he may have been nearby.	mety ho teo akaiky teo anefa izy
The night is far away.	lavitra ny alina
Probably the same as everything else here.	angamba mitovy aminny zavatra hafa rehetra eto
So I lost this one.	ka very ity iray ity
I think so too.	heveriko fa izany koa
Only now did he do it harder.	vao izao izy vao nanao izany mafy kokoa
Not for me !.	tsy ho aho
If you have an idea, you better.	raha manana hevitra ianao dia tsara kokoa
The big time has come.	tonga ny fotoana lehibe
He went.	nandeha izy
He knew it was there.	fantany fa nisy izany
Too much visible.	hita be loatra
And I have seen them.	ary efa nahita azy ireo
The words, however.	ny teny anefa
All of this is good and very general.	izany rehetra izany dia tsara ary tena ankapobeny
Some are really good.	ny sasany dia tena tsara
A little harder than that.	somary sarotra kokoa noho izany
and very personal.	ary tena manokana
But no, it was still there.	saingy tsia mbola teo ihany ilay izy
Get well.	mahazo tsara
He knew it was the end.	fantany fa io no farany
The dead can never be bad.	tsy mety ho ratsy mihitsy ny maty
Part of it is that they don’t really want to do that.	ny ampahany aminy dia tsy tena te hanao izany
Not only that, but in the future as well.	tsy ho aminizany ihany fa aminny ho avy koa
It is the largest.	izy io no lehibe indrindra
I have to go to work.	tsy maintsy mandeha miasa aho
But he was telling the truth.	nilaza ny marina anefa izy
Easy, it should be.	mora tokony ho
But its and enough for one person.	fa azy io ary ampy ho anny olona iray
The essentials.	ny tena ilaina
We are here together.	miaraka isika eto
It’s not just a lot of talk.	tsy dia resaka be fotsiny ilay izy
And of course that’s a good thing.	ary mazava ho azy fa zavatra tsara izany
There is no past or future.	tsy misy ny lasa na ny ho avy
Look carefully, he said.	jereo tsara hoy izy
I never did that when I was a kid.	tsy nanao izany mihitsy aho taminny mbola kely
It's not a small thing.	tsy dia kely akory izany
The house is gone.	lasa ny trano
That’s the part about losing time too quickly.	izany no ampahany haingana loatra very ny fotoana
However, the process is not very simple.	na izany aza ny dingana dia tsy dia tsotra
Otherwise, he goes too far.	raha tsy izany dia lasa lavitra izy
The pictures are good.	tsara ny sary
Only now has it taken on a new meaning.	vao izao vao nisy dikany vaovao izany
Sometimes it’s not so much different, but so different to be important.	indraindray dia tsy hafa be loatra fa tena hafa mba ho zavadehibe
People are not so fast.	tsy dia haingana ny olona
He saw nothing else.	tsy nahita zavatra hafa izy
Not completely dead.	tsy maty tanteraka
All results should be bad.	ny vokatra rehetra dia tokony ho ratsy
To say yes.	ny hoe eny
There is another option as well.	misy safidy iray hafa koa misy
You are too small.	kely loatra ianao
She’s beautiful, for sure.	tsara tarehy izy azo antoka
I've seen one.	efa nahita iray aho
To me it’s a very small part though.	amiko ampahany kely dia kely anefa
Nothing is absolutely certain.	tsy misy azo antoka tanteraka
They have to drive.	tsy maintsy mandeha fiara izy ireo
In fact, this story is not made for you.	raha ny marina dia tsy natao ho anao ity tantara ity
This is also unusual.	tsy mahazatra koa izany
All three are just fun.	izy telo ireo dia mahafinaritra fotsiny
But somewhere else.	toerana hafa anefa
They looked at me.	nijery ahy izy ireo
The man had to look away.	tsy maintsy nijery lavitra ilay lehilahy
The same old story.	ilay tantara taloha ihany
That is a problem now.	olana ankehitriny izany
She needed him inside.	nila azy tao anatiny izy
The reasons are not the same.	tsy mitovy ny antony
All of this is coming soon.	ho avy tsy ho ela izany rehetra izany
I want to be sure of that.	tiako ho azo antoka izany
I'm not needed.	tsy ilaina aho
Away from him? 	lavitra azy
That should be the end.	izany no tokony ho ny farany
But that may not be true.	mety tsy marina akory anefa izany
If you don’t, don’t do it for us.	raha tsy manao izany ianao dia aza manao izany ho antsika
This path is exactly the same as the first.	io lalana io dia mitovy tanteraka aminny voalohany
But time is the biggest issue for me.	ny fotoana anefa no olana lehibe indrindra amiko
It will be better.	dia ho tsara kokoa
Here is the picture.	ity ny sary
It would be crazy.	ho adala izany
I think that’s the wrong approach.	heveriko fa fomba diso izany
Many to me.	maro amiko
He had something to lose.	nanana zavatra ho very izy
Yes, basically everything.	eny aminny ankapobeny ny zavadrehetra
At first he said no.	taminny voalohany dia nilaza izy hoe tsia
And of course they will.	ary mazava ho azy fa ho izy ireo
But not yet for me.	saingy tsy mbola amiko
I need to do this more often.	mila manao izany matetika kokoa aho
This is not a bad life.	tsy fiainana ratsy izany
When these are present, they do not go well.	rehefa misy ireo dia tsy mandeha tsara
It really made sense.	tena nisy dikany tokoa ilay izy
I am new to this.	vaovao momba izany aho
There are other types who like to work at night.	misy karazana hafa tia miasa alina
It will be no different.	tsy ho hafa mihitsy izany
We get the truth.	mahazo ny marina isika
It’s about that said it all.	ny momba izany no nilaza izany rehetra izany
They hope to do more.	manantena izy ireo hanao bebe kokoa
It could be more.	mety ho bebe kokoa izany
We get it !.	mahazo izany izahay
Big enough.	lehibe dia ampy
They just drive the car and walk away.	mandeha fotsiny ny fiara izy ireo ary mandeha lavitra
This is mine.	ity no ahy
Three right, one wrong.	telo marina iray diso
They had to do something about it.	tsy maintsy nanao zavatra momba izany izy ireo
I have never seen him.	mbola tsy nahita azy mihitsy aho
We got a lot of other people.	nahazo olona maro hafa izahay
They did not tell him.	tsy nilaza taminy izy ireo
Everything is done now, and nothing.	ny zavadrehetra dia atao aminizao fotoana izao ary tsy misy na inona na inona
It is very new.	tena vaovao izy io
And more than ever.	ary mihoatra noho ny indraindray
Overall this is a fun game.	aminny ankapobeny dia lalao mahafinaritra ity
You will absolutely love it.	ho tianao tanteraka izany
I don’t think you should be like that.	heveriko fa tsy tokony ho toy izany ianao
He then looked at the others.	nijery ny hafa izy avy eo
In fact, he said.	raha ny marina hoy izy
And he’s fun.	ary mahafinaritra izy
You have the money somewhere.	manana ny vola ianao any ho any
They are also always crowded places.	toerana be olona foana koa izy ireo
Yes, he was wrong.	eny diso izy
It works now.	miasa aminizao fotoana izao izany
But if not.	fa raha tsy nisy
Because this is the only real time.	satria izao ihany no fotoana tena misy
Then he has a better idea.	dia manana hevitra tsara kokoa izy
There is nothing you can do about it.	tsy misy azonao atao momba izany
He was there but not there.	teo izy fa tsy teo
But you have seen them.	efa nahita azy ireo anefa ianao
The other woman had.	ilay vehivavy hafa nanana
Not all men, but men.	tsy ny lehilahy rehetra fa ny lehilahy
They often don’t.	matetika izy ireo no tsy manao izany
But there is another way.	misy fomba hafa anefa
I have to die.	tsy maintsy maty aho
And they can be very long.	ary mety ho ela be izy ireo
Don’t see that he can’t.	aza mahita hoe tsy afaka izy
Unless you have to have one.	raha tsy hoe tsy maintsy manana iray ianao
When they stopped, he stopped.	rehefa nijanona izy ireo dia nijanona izy
He was finally close.	akaiky ihany izy taminny farany
I'm below now.	eto ambany aho izao
But maybe he had an idea.	fa angamba nanana hevitra izy
Not good .	tsy tsara
And then when people started dying.	ary avy eo rehefa nanomboka maty ny olona
But you can see them now.	saingy afaka mahita azy ireo ianao izao
All that is gone.	izay rehetra efa lasa
No one has a good thing.	tsy misy olona manana zavatra tsara
Come too.	tonga ihany koa
It doesn’t really matter.	tsy dia zavadehibe loatra izany
There was not one.	tsy nisy na dia iray aza
He doesn’t have it anymore.	tsy manana izany intsony izy
We are just human beings.	olona fotsiny izahay
With a typical home.	miaraka aminny trano mahazatra
Right now you have no money.	aminizao fotoana izao dia tsy manana vola ianao
One is, of course, that she has to be a woman.	ny iray dia mazava ho azy fa tsy maintsy vehivavy izy
He doesn't look.	tsy mijery izy
Something was wrong with him.	nisy zavatra ratsy be taminy
He already knows enough about it.	efa ampy ny fantany momba izany
Just like at the time.	toy ny taminny fotoana
However, not too much.	na izany aza tsy dia be loatra
You are confused and do not see well.	very hevitra ianao ary tsy mahita tsara
Not at all, in fact.	tsy misy mihitsy raha ny marina
especially for me.	manokana ho ahy
And we may come to that now.	ary mety ho tonga aminizany koa isika izao
It’s different to talk going alone at night.	hafa ny resaka mandeha irery aminny alina
Each step is important.	zavadehibe ny dingana tsirairay
I don't see a thing.	tsy mahita zavatra iray aho
I love it because it’s still new today.	tiako ilay izy satria mbola vaovao foana izy io ankehitriny
I think you will do the work.	heveriko fa hanao ny asa ianao
Not looking to the future.	tsy mijery ny ho avy
This is probably the best part.	ity angamba no ampahany tsara indrindra
You can only do that in real life.	aminny tena fiainana ihany no azonao atao izany
But it takes something.	mila zavatra anefa izany
But he did not know how.	saingy tsy fantany ny fomba
The question really said that.	ny fanontaniana dia tena nilaza izany
He was happy to be there.	faly izy tonga any
They don’t all have to be good either.	tsy tokony ho tsara daholo koa izy ireo
Hope you like it too.	manantena ianao fa tianao koa
He looks good.	toa tsara izy
This is a great man.	lehilahy lehibe ity
The reason, you already know.	ny antony efa fantatrao
And in fact, it wasn’t meant for me.	ary raha ny marina dia tsy natao ho ahy izany
It's not too small.	tsy dia kely loatra ilay izy
You haven't said anything to me in a long time.	efa ela ianao no tsy nilaza na inona na inona tamiko
And they are always happy to see me.	ary faly foana izy ireo mahita ahy
We did something good.	nanao zavatra tsara izahay
It’s not fun at all.	tsy mahafinaritra mihitsy izany
I have one now.	manana iray aho izao
None of them anymore.	tsy misy intsony aminizy ireo
The last.	ny farany
And it works very fast.	ary miasa haingana be
Not happy either.	tsy faly koa
That's all it should be.	izay ihany no tokony ho izy
I know you love him.	fantatro fa tia azy ianao
Great place for them.	toerana mahafinaritra ho azy ireo
Even tonight.	na dia aminity alina ity aza
But, if that is the case, it is not certain.	saingy raha izany no izy dia tsy azo antoka izany
Make them special to events around the world.	manao manokana azy ireo aminny hetsika misy eto aminizao tontolo izao
And it will be there.	ary efa ho eo izany
But it’s almost never enough.	saingy saika tsy ampy mihitsy
I have never seen anyone like that.	mbola tsy nahita olona toa foana aho
But there are many more women.	mbola be lavitra noho izany anefa ireo vehivavy ireo
Or maybe the truth.	na angamba ny marina
It must be done as well.	tsy maintsy atao koa izany
The battle is fierce.	mafy ny ady
Life is wonderful right now.	mahafinaritra ny fiainana aminizao fotoana izao
He needed time.	nila fotoana izy
Sometimes life is like that.	indraindray dia toy izany ny fiainana
You just don’t know.	tsy fantatrao fotsiny
Not much thought.	tsy dia nieritreritra loatra
He’s a real picture.	tena sary izy
He is not himself.	tsy ny tenany izy
I need that, that sure, right now.	mila izany aho izany antoka izany aminizao fotoana izao
You want to do it right.	te hanao izany tsara ianao
Please see everything.	mba jereo ny zavadrehetra
No problem for me.	tsy hisy olana amiko
It was also real for them.	tena nisy ihany koa izany ho azy ireo
He knew there was no other place for him now.	fantany fa tsy misy toerana hafa ho azy ankehitriny
They don't see.	tsy mahita izy ireo
So do it fast.	ka ataovy haingana
After all, he did the job.	raha ny zavadrehetra dia nanao izany asa izany izy
Here you have two options.	eto ianao dia manana safidy roa
We didn’t have much.	tsy nanana zavatra betsaka izahay
And only one is needed.	ary iray ihany no ilaina
I couldn’t do that before.	tsy afaka nanao izany aho taloha
He wasn’t that big of a deal.	tsy dia lehibe taminizany izy
They have seen it before.	efa nahita izany izy ireo taloha
He could no longer find himself in them.	tsy afaka nahita ny tenany tao aminizy ireo intsony izy
It is very certain about you, and not others.	tena azo antoka ny momba anao fa tsy ny hafa
Like the old days.	toa ny taloha
I don’t think they do much.	heveriko fa tsy manao zavatra betsaka izy ireo
In the end, you may be ahead.	aminny farany dia mety ho eo aloha ianao
He came, with no choice.	tonga izy tsy nisy safidy
I can't thank you.	tsy afaka misaotra anao
You know that's true.	fantatrao fa marina izany
But not for him.	fa tsy ho azy
You just have to do it right.	mila manao izany tsara fotsiny ianao
They both didn’t look down.	samy tsy nijery ambany izy ireo
That job should be mine.	tokony ho ahy io asa io
You certainly did.	azo antoka fa nanao izany ianao
It is possible, of course.	azo atao izany mazava ho azy
You haven't been there yet.	tsy mbola tany ianao
The place has a history.	manana tantara ilay toerana
And once wrong.	ary indray mandeha tsy mety
If so, he is mistaken.	raha izany no izy dia diso hevitra izy
So there may be more than one thing.	ka mety misy zavatra mihoatra noho ny iray
If not, you can definitely do one.	raha tsy izany dia tena afaka manao iray
He was the one who did not see it.	izy no tsy nahita izany
Both ideas have major problems.	samy manana olana lehibe ireo hevitra roa ireo
Like, you know, like.	toy ny hoe fantatrao toy ny hoe
She really liked this man.	tena tiany io lehilahy io
You had to look down.	tsy maintsy nijery ambany ianao
They’re not the same, you know.	tsy mitovy izy ireo fantatrao
And of course he was right.	ary mazava ho azy fa marina izy
There is something wrong with all of this, and.	misy zavatra tsy mety aminizany rehetra izany ary
He looked at himself first.	nijery ny tenany aloha izy
Very hard too.	tena mafy koa
It had two parts.	nisy ampahany roa izy io
Some want to do that.	misy te hanao izany
There is no time either.	tsy misy fotoana koa
But there was this other part.	saingy nisy ity ampahany hafa ity
But nothing else did.	tsy nisy zavatra hafa nanao izany anefa
This can be done at any stage.	izany dia azo atao aminny dingana rehetra
This year is no different.	tsy misy hafa mihitsy ity taona ity
You know he’s not at all.	fantatrao fa tsy izany mihitsy izy
For obvious reasons.	noho ny antony mazava
And they do nothing.	ary tsy manao na inona na inona izy ireo
They will also do it at the right time.	izy ireo ihany koa dia hanao izany aminny fotoana mety
And people come in the way here.	ary tonga aminny fomba ny olona eto
And here it is, love one.	ary izao no izy tia ny iray
Do it as you go.	ataovy toy ny mandeha
In fact, he was never happy.	raha ny marina dia tsy faly mihitsy izy
But there were also games.	nisy ihany koa anefa ny lalao
I need them soon.	mila azy ireo tsy ho ela aho
She was fun, and so were we.	nahafinaritra izy ary izahay koa
There was something about them.	nisy zavatra momba azy ireo
It always seems to be.	toa foana ilay izy
This makes sense for many reasons.	misy dikany izany noho ny antony maro
It’s also easy.	mora ihany koa ilay izy
If you don’t go check it out.	raha tsy mandeha mijery izany
For you tonight.	ho anao izao alina izao
They are very happy.	tena faly izy ireo
It can be just as bad.	mety ho ratsy ihany izany
And it’s much safer.	ary azo antoka kokoa izany
They don't have to do it for others.	tsy mila manao ho anny hafa izy ireo
You can't even.	tsy afaka akory ianao
Good if you go.	tsara raha mandeha ianao
Of course, this is not the best for you.	mazava ho azy fa tsy izany no tsara indrindra ho anao
But I disagree.	tsy mitovy hevitra anefa aho
Yes, that is bad.	eny ratsy izany
Life without time is not real life.	ny fiainana tsy misy fotoana dia tsy tena fiainana
Nothing was found in the first house.	tsy misy na inona na inona hita aminny trano voalohany
You work away from home.	miasa lavitra ny trano ianao
But you still need to do it.	saingy mbola mila manao izany ianao
I like to work alone.	tiako ny miasa irery
I love him for that.	tiako izy noho izany
But they came.	tonga anefa izy ireo
You will come when we are.	ho avy ianao rehefa izahay
And they saw nothing.	ary tsy nahita na inona na inona izy ireo
And of course.	ary mazava ho azy
You’re better off without it.	tsara kokoa ianao raha tsy misy azy
Yes, that is the problem.	eny izany no olana
But no one will.	tsy hisy hanao izany anefa
And things and things and things.	ary zavatra sy zavatra ary zavatra hafa
I just thought it was bad.	nieritreritra fotsiny aho hoe ratsy
Finally, he took the first step.	farany nanao ny dingana voalohany izy
And now you too.	ary izao koa ianao
Of course, this is not someone else.	mazava ho azy fa tsy olona hafa izany
We never saw him.	samy tsy nahita azy mihitsy izahay
And of course, she's not pretty either.	ary mazava ho azy fa tsy tsara tarehy koa izy
So the first job can work more often.	noho izany ny asa voalohany dia afaka miasa matetika kokoa
But that is not the point.	tsy izay anefa no zavadehibe
He paused for a moment.	nijanona kely teo izy
there, good people.	any olona tsara
At first, it seemed like a good idea to work here.	taminny voalohany dia toa hevitra tsara ny miasa eto
The part is what matters.	ny ampahany no zavadehibe
I really have to be here.	tsy maintsy tena eto aho
He seems to be doing it.	toa manao izany izy
Of course it works.	mazava ho azy fa miasa izany
It wouldn’t have started if it weren’t for you.	tsy ho nanomboka izany raha tsy ho anao
He is already dead.	efa maty ihany izy
It won’t make sense right now.	tsy hisy dikany izany aminizao fotoana izao
The ones that are really true.	ireo izay tena marina
And, yes, it took a little work.	ary eny nila asa kely izany
I'm not long.	tsy ela aho
I never thought it was possible.	tsy nieritreritra mihitsy aho hoe azo atao izany
But much is missing.	betsaka anefa ny zavatra tsy hita
It was always fun.	nahafinaritra foana ilay izy
Often, though, that is not enough.	tsy ampy anefa izany matetika
Already there, did it.	efa teo nanao izany
She’s good to me for that.	tsara amiko izy aminizany
Then he left.	dia nandeha izy avy eo
They are both alone.	samy irery izy ireo
This is his favorite food.	io no sakafo tiany indrindra
Sometimes this can be a problem.	indraindray dia mety ho olana izany
We had a beautiful home.	nanana trano tsara tarehy izahay
Yours is a very difficult place.	toerana sarotra be ny anao
The latest and greatest news.	ny vaovao farany sy ny farany
I have never been like that before.	mbola tsy nisy toy izany tamiko mihitsy
It's been a long time coming.	efa ela no tonga izany
Especially women alone.	indrindra fa vehivavy irery
But it doesn’t seem to matter.	saingy toa tsy misy na inona na inona izany
Will do it quickly.	hanao izany haingana
Expect it though.	manantena izany na izany aza
But there is something else.	misy zavatra hafa anefa
Age is not the most important thing.	tsy ny taona no tena zavadehibe
It was fun.	nahafinaritra azy
Maybe that’s what it should be.	angamba izany no tokony ho izy
But it’s not and it shouldn’t be.	saingy tsy izany ary tsy tokony ho izany
I hope it means the same thing.	manantena aho fa mitovy ny dikany
Don't be honest.	aza manao ny marina
That’s what it’s about.	izany no momba izany
He had never seen anything like it.	tsy nahita zavatra toy izany izy
The first woman.	ny vehivavy voalohany
I hope you are going well.	manantena aho fa mandeha tsara ianao
I just didn’t.	tsy nanao fotsiny aho
They got us.	nahazo anay izy ireo
Or maybe he already has it.	na mety efa manana izy izao
The game gets faster.	lasa haingana kokoa ny lalao
This is important.	zavadehibe ity
But there is no time to lose.	saingy tsy misy fotoana ho very
As fast as you can.	haingana araka izay azonao atao
It doesn’t work either.	tsy mandeha koa izany
Women especially needed it.	ny vehivavy indrindra no nila izany
You don’t need them.	tsy mila azy ireo ianao
Or, in fact, we did.	na raha ny marina nanao izany izahay
It doesn’t work the usual way.	tsy mandeha ny fomba mahazatra
You know you did too.	fantatrao fa nanao izany koa ianao
So he shouldn't be here yet.	ka tsy tokony mbola eto izy
Yes, that’s something, he said.	eny zavatra izany hoy izy
That might be the worst.	mety ho izany no ratsy indrindra
And it’s just one word.	ary teny iray ihany izany
Although you may disagree.	na dia mety tsy mitovy hevitra aza ianao
The higher the better.	ny ambony no tsara kokoa
It doesn’t make sense to me to have meaning.	tsy misy dikany amiko ny manana dikany
You know, here, with me.	fantatrao eto miaraka amiko
But these are clear steps.	fa ireo dia dingana mazava
He saw little, nothing.	nahita kely izy tsy nisy na inona na inona
I’m glad it was only once.	faly aho fa indray mandeha ihany ilay izy
There is this world.	misy io tontolo io
He even saw it.	nahita izany mihitsy aza izy
People just love him.	tia azy fotsiny ny olona
Well, it might be possible.	eny ary mety ho azo atao izany
It takes time and money.	mila fotoana sy vola izany
There was little talk.	nisy resaka kely
Too beautiful a woman for that.	vehivavy tsara tarehy loatra aminizany
We always have a choice.	manana safidy foana isika
She looks really cool.	toa mahafinaritra tokoa izy
Without the other, the self is meaningless.	raha tsy misy ny hafa dia tsy misy dikany ny tena
They are in it.	izy ireo no ao anatiny
He certainly didn’t like it.	azo antoka fa tsy tiany izany
It will not be easy for you.	tsy ho mora aminao
That is not a good word.	tsy teny tsara izany
Then he saw something else.	nahita zavatra hafa koa izy avy eo
I think you know that and so do we.	heveriko fa fantatrao izany ary isika koa
This is a great time.	fotoana lehibe izao
And rightly so.	ary marina
It can be hard and bad.	mety ho mafy sy ratsy ilay izy
Then, start where you are now.	avy eo manomboka aminny toerana misy anao ankehitriny
If only it were that simple.	raha izay tsotra ihany
I don't know the right way.	tsy fantatro ny lalana marina
I seem to find that I like it.	toa hitako fa tiako izany
And earn money.	ary mahazo vola
Maybe I'm missing something.	misy zavatra tsy ampy angamba aho
And there really is no choice.	ary tena tsy misy safidy
It’s old, two stories.	taloha izy io tantara roa
We will be honest in all things.	ho marina isika aminny zavadrehetra
We have no problem.	tsy manana olana izahay
I know he can do better than now.	fantatro fa afaka manao tsara kokoa noho izao izy
Of course we look good.	mazava ho azy fa mijery tsara izahay
You are absolutely right on one thing.	tena marina ianao aminny zavatra iray
There are indeed some of these moments.	misy tokoa ny sasany aminireo fotoana ireo
He didn’t know what time it was.	tsy fantany hoe inona ny fotoana
It will be old news.	ho vaovao taloha izany
He could have had it.	afaka nanana izany izy
He was unique.	tsy nisy toa azy izy
He did what he wanted.	nanao izay tiany izy
He knew immediately about it.	fantany avy hatrany ny momba izany
But the truth is, he didn’t.	saingy ny marina dia tsy nanao izany izy
Or someone like him.	na olona toa azy
But that's all it will be.	fa izay ihany no ho izy
But just the old stuff.	fa ny zavatra taloha ihany
The big problem is the food.	ny olana lehibe dia ny sakafo
That should seem a little familiar.	tokony ho toa mahazatra kely izany
It still works.	mbola miasa izy io
But he knows life.	fa fantany ny fiainana
I know what it is.	fantatro hoe inona ilay izy
Everything seems to be the same as before.	toa toy ny teo aloha ihany ny zavadrehetra
I found the truth.	hitako ny marina
I have no past.	tsy manana lasa aho
It is now a real house.	tena trano izy izao
But get there.	fa tonga eo
It’s not working right now, of course.	tsy mandeha izany aminizao fotoana izao mazava ho azy
It’s all so fast.	haingana tokoa izany rehetra izany
Someone got it.	nisy nahazo izany
He didn't really need it.	tsy tena nila izany izy
If so, so be it.	raha izany no izy dia izany
I really like this woman.	tena tiako io vehivavy io
I just knew they were.	fantatro fotsiny fa izy ireo
The car went without any major problems.	nandeha tsy nisy olana lehibe ny fiara
This is the first day.	andro voalohany izao
You made a lot of money.	nahazo vola be ianao
Not just now, and not yet.	tsy aminizao fotoana izao ihany ary tsy mbola
These are all good things.	zavatra tsara daholo ireo
This thing is really important.	tena zavadehibe tokoa ity zavatra ity
I like the same thing.	mitovy aminizany koa no tiako
And then they were on the ground.	ary avy eo dia teo aminny tany izy ireo
This is the last question.	io no fanontaniana farany
However, both of them.	na izany aza ny roa aminizy ireo
A lot of people love you.	be dia be ny olona tia anao
Which you like best.	izay tianao indrindra
We stopped again.	nijanona indray izahay
Time, it seems, is never enough.	ny fotoana toa tsy ampy mihitsy
Everyone needs to be alone sometimes.	mila irery ny tsirairay indraindray
Like any other world down below.	toy ny tontolo hafa any ambany any
A lot, actually.	be dia be raha ny marina
For some, this is for sure.	ho anny sasany dia azo antoka izany
But some things are difficult.	sarotra anefa ny zavatra sasany
And everyone is needed.	ary ilaina ny rehetra
And no, it's not that he's bad.	ary tsy izany tsy hoe ratsy izy
For the better, though.	ho anny tsara kokoa na izany aza
I got the big one of course.	nahazo ny lehibe aho mazava ho azy
There is a lot that can go wrong.	be dia be ny mety ho diso
She will be better than that, love.	ho tsara kokoa noho izany izy tia
It won’t be that fast.	tsy ho haingana toy izany ihany
He was the greatest lover of money.	izy no olona tia vola be indrindra
This is a good idea for two reasons.	hevitra tsara izany noho ny antony roa
That's enough, he said.	ampy izay hoy izy
Not just for now but for the future.	tsy aminizao fotoana izao ihany fa ho anny ho avy
But that doesn’t make sense to me.	tsy misy dikany amiko anefa izany
I think the neighborhood is a bad idea.	heveriko fa hevitra ratsy ny manodidina
It can also be more difficult.	mety ho sarotra kokoa koa izany
Still, it would have been fun.	na dia izany aza dia ho nahafinaritra
A place where nothing was.	toerana tsy nisy na inona na inona
But it was made for the best.	saingy natao ho anny tsara indrindra izany
Or have some.	na manana ny sasany
He is new.	izy no vaovao
But it is a pointless job.	asa tsy misy dikany anefa
And the word came to him.	dia tonga taminy ny teny
This was wrong in many ways.	diso izany taminny fomba maro
Bigger than before.	lehibe kokoa noho ny teo aloha
The same is true of women.	toy izany koa ny vehivavy
What was lacking was generally lacking.	tsy ampy taminny ankapobeny ny zavatra tsy ampy taminizany
It is not easy to find.	tsy dia mora ny mahita azy io
To me, too.	amiko koa izany
Because it would be crazy.	satria ho adala izany
They all saw it.	samy nahita izany izy rehetra
He said he would be happy to do one.	nilaza izy fa ho faly ny hanao iray
He was definitely still driving.	azo antoka fa mbola nandeha fiara izy
I did the wrong thing.	diso asa aho
They have to be there.	tsy maintsy any izy ireo
There was.	nisy taminizany
This is the best of both worlds.	ity no tena tsara indrindra aminny tontolo roa
And to them.	ary aminizy ireo
But, the picture is good.	saingy tsara ilay sary
That’s the right approach.	fomba marina izany
Just need to look at things.	mila mijery zavatra fotsiny
But if he had done so, it would have been a long time ago.	fa raha nanao izany izy dia efa taloha
This man is bad.	ratsy io lehilahy io
But you should not do that.	tsy tokony hanao izany anefa
I can do something for you.	afaka manao zavatra ho anao aho
And he says here too.	dia hoy koa izy eto
It will still be good.	mbola ho tsara izany
A little, though.	kely anefa
Hope you like it.	manantena ianao fa tianao izany
You are right.	marina ny anao
He couldn't say that.	tsy afaka nilaza izany izy
This is especially difficult for many reasons.	sarotra indrindra izany noho ny antony maro
But he started there.	nanomboka teo anefa izy
It really is one of them.	iray aminizy ireo tokoa io
It just looks good.	toa tsara ihany
But it was fun.	fa nahafinaritra
In general, it makes no sense.	aminny ankapobeny dia tsy misy dikany
They are definitely gone.	azo antoka fa lasa izy ireo
All good stuff.	zavatra tsara rehetra
Works well on both.	miasa tsara aminny roa
But he seems to know what it is.	toa fantany anefa hoe inona izany
He didn't even look at us.	tsy nijery anay akory izy
It’s really good for them.	tena tsara ho azy ireo izany
And you watched.	ary nijery ianao
There have been people for a long time.	efa ela no nisy olona
The good news is that you can do things now.	ny vaovao tsara dia hoe afaka manao zavatra ianao izao
He looked around them.	nijery manodidina azy ireo izy
And not just a little higher.	ary tsy ambony kely fotsiny
Process is the right word for you.	ny dingana no teny mety aminao
But maybe you can.	fa angamba azonao atao
It may not be different for you.	mety tsy ho hafa aminao izany
It seems more difficult now.	toa sarotra kokoa izany ankehitriny
But, that’s only part of the story.	saingy ampahany aminny tantara ihany izany
No, everything.	tsia izao rehetra izao
In fact, they work.	raha ny marina anefa dia miasa izy ireo
He knows now.	fantany izao
But only now.	fa izao ihany
Everything at once.	izy rehetra indray mandeha
Apparently this is not possible.	hita fa tsy azo atao izany
We haven't been on time in a long time.	efa ela izahay no tsy tonga fotoana
There was a job for him.	nisy asa ho azy
We are doing stupid things.	manao zavatra adala izahay
But it is very difficult.	tena mafy anefa izany
He became the greatest.	lasa lehibe indrindra izy
He knows exactly what they are.	fantany tsara hoe inona izy ireo
It doesn’t seem very common.	toa tsy dia mahazatra loatra ilay izy
It was empty at first.	foana izy io taminny voalohany
And it’s important.	ary zavadehibe io
I'll know if you don't.	ho fantatro raha tsy ianao
I can't see him clearly.	tsy hitako mazava tsara izy
It wasn’t fun, but it will be.	tsy nahafinaritra izany fa ho toy izany
It will be like this.	dia ho toy izao izany
Not on you.	tsy eo aminao
He had fewer words.	nanana ny teny kely kokoa izy
But he knew it was wrong.	saingy fantany fa tsy mety izany
In fact, he is now dead.	efa maty izy izao raha ny marina
A lot of people told me that.	betsaka ny olona nilaza izany tamiko
I think that’s a good fit for that.	heveriko fa mety tsara aminizany izany
I just want to do everything.	te hanao ny zavadrehetra fotsiny aho
You can’t get something trivial.	tsy afaka mahazo zavatra tsy misy dikany ianao
That’s another good thing, too.	zavatra tsara hafa koa izany
And it should be.	ary tokony ho izany
It may not be immediately apparent.	mety tsy ho hita avy hatrany izany
You are still here.	mbola eto koa ianao
There will be more to it soon.	tsy ho ela dia hisy bebe kokoa aminizany
What a wonderful time.	fotoana mahafinaritra tokoa
They walk around.	mandeha manodidina izy ireo
For me and for them too.	ho ahy sy ho azy ireo koa
It’s all the same for me.	mitovy daholo amiko izany
Whether it is right or wrong is irrelevant.	na mety na tsy mety dia tsy misy dikany
In fact, you know it well.	raha ny marina fantatrao tsara izany
Not right, though.	tsy mety na izany aza
Nothing is easy.	tsy misy mora
I think it should be.	heveriko fa tokony ho izy
He did the same.	nanao ny mitovy aminy izy
It's still day.	mbola andro ny andro
Either way it always is.	na izany na tsy izany dia foana
It’s something you don’t like.	zavatra tsy tianao izany
No other species is very close.	tsy misy karazana hafa tena akaiky
Yes, about that.	eny momba izany
That should be great for you.	tokony ho lehibe ho anao izany
In fact, we are not.	raha ny marina dia tsy izahay
But there may be other reasons for this.	mety hisy antony hafa tanteraka aminizany anefa
Some people don’t want to be seen.	misy olona tsy te ho hita
Some didn’t even get it.	ny sasany aza tsy nahazo
There seems to be no end to the options.	toa tsy misy farany ny safidy
He is not really dead.	tsy tena maty izy
He will be better than that.	ho tsara kokoa izy noho izany
All the past is gone.	ny lasa rehetra dia lasa
We’re just getting started.	vao nanomboka izahay
So very wrong.	ka diso be
I did not go on a trip.	tsy nandeha taminny dia aho
This game, however, is fun.	ity lalao ity anefa dia mahafinaritra
He just told me.	nilaza tamiko fotsiny izy
Not many people saw it.	tsy betsaka ny olona nahita izany
That’s the right path.	izany no lalana mety
There is a special reason for this one.	misy antony manokana ity iray ity
It’s a classic game.	lalao mahazatra izany
Of course, that remains to be seen.	mazava ho azy fa mbola ho hita izany
And you are still wrong.	ary mbola diso ianao
Yes, thanks for the question.	eny misaotra aminny fanontaniana
Time just seems to go by.	toa mandeha fotsiny ny fotoana
Everything is free.	afaka ny zavadrehetra
It is meant for one species.	natao ho anny karazana iray izany
They are the best of the best.	izy ireo no tsara indrindra aminny tsara indrindra
He had thought about everything.	efa nieritreritra ny zavadrehetra izy
Two days maybe.	roa andro angamba
If he does not.	raha tsy manao izany izy
And that seems to be enough.	ary toa ampy izany
Do them the same.	ataovy mitovy izy ireo
But he knew it was more than that.	fantany anefa fa mihoatra noho izany izany
So, it could be a lot of money.	noho izany mety ho be dia be ny vola be
No, maybe.	tsia angamba
Previous photo above.	sary ambony teo aloha
That was always the hardest thing for him.	izany foana no sarotra indrindra taminy
I really didn’t think to do that.	tena tsy nieritreritra ny hanao izany aho
You are already in the right place.	efa eo aminny toerana tokony hisy anao ianao
So you said good.	ka hoy ianao hoe tsara
So there are two stories.	noho izany dia misy tantara roa
It's a small house, you can't.	trano kely izay tsy azonao atao
None of that is true.	tsy misy izany hoe marina izany
It gets really bad, really fast.	izany dia lasa tena ratsy tena haingana
Very bad.	tena ratsy be
But that doesn’t seem to make sense.	saingy toa tsy misy dikany izany
Here and now is the time.	eto ary izao ny fotoana
It should be high.	tokony ho ambony
She is the most beautiful.	izy no tsara tarehy indrindra
Don't go this way.	aza mandeha aminity lalana ity
It’s not about you, it’s them.	tsy momba anao izany fa izy ireo
It was never done.	tsy natao mihitsy izy io
He is from here.	avy eto izy
You look below.	jereo ambany ianao
I was so happy to see them.	tena faly aho nahita azy ireo
You have to look two years from now.	mila mijery roa taona manomboka izao ianao
The past, present and future are different.	ny lasa ny ankehitriny ary ny ho avy dia samy hafa
But it works well for others.	fa miasa tsara ho anny hafa
I look like you.	mitovy aminao aho
In fact, you can do it right away.	raha ny marina dia afaka manao izany avy hatrany ianao
They always seemed different to me.	toa hafa tamiko foana izy ireo
More than one person was found.	olona mihoatra ny iray no hita
He never said that again.	tsy nilaza izany intsony izy
That’s work, he said.	asa izay hoy izy
This is the first step.	io no dingana voalohany indrindra
I love this story.	tiako ity tantara ity
Wrong to be good.	diso ho tsara
As always, you look great.	toy ny mahazatra mijery mahafinaritra ianao
They didn't see one.	tsy nahita na dia iray aza izy ireo
I think we can be in the future.	heveriko fa mety aminny ho avy isika
It goes and works well.	mandeha ary miasa tsara
It has to be like this and like that.	tsy maintsy toy izao sy izao
It’s so nice to see you again.	tena mahafinaritra ny mahita anao indray
Of course, that should not be the case.	mazava ho azy fa tsy tokony ho toy izany
It seems to be taking longer than before.	toa ela kokoa noho ny teo aloha izany
The man saw me coming.	nahita ahy tonga ilay lehilahy
So they have become commonplace.	noho izany dia lasa mahazatra izy ireo
The good old days have come.	tonga izao ny andro tsara taloha
I can’t do all that.	tsy afaka manao izany rehetra izany aho
These are really bad.	tena ratsy ireo
Timing is very important.	tena zavadehibe ny fotoana
If they are lost, you are lost.	raha very izy ireo dia very ianao
He loves her, not fights.	tiany izy fa tsy ady
What is food.	inona no atao hoe sakafo
But still not good.	saingy mbola tsy tsara
It still works well as new.	mbola miasa tsara toy ny vaovao izy io
However, this is not the only possibility.	na izany aza tsy izany ihany no azo atao
Like, right now.	toy izao aminizao fotoana izao
Of course you can be with me.	mazava ho azy fa afaka miaraka amiko ianao
He does everything and does it well.	manao ny zavadrehetra izy ary manao izany tsara
The inside is different.	ny ao anatiny no hafa
Not all of them.	tsy izy rehetra
Your favorite.	ny tena tianao indrindra
You need one.	mila iray ianao
I know some parts.	fantatro ny ampahany sasany
Walking, but not alone.	mandeha fa tsy irery
I will always be here.	ho eto foana aho
However it is the easiest.	na izany aza no mora indrindra
You really do.	tena manao izany ianao
There seems to be nothing better to do.	toa tsy misy zavatra tsara kokoa atao
Really great job.	tena asa lehibe
Everyone works.	samy miasa ny tsirairay
Not sure if that's enough.	tsy azo antoka fa ampy izany
If they thought.	raha nieritreritra izy ireo
It’s that easy.	mora toy izany
That thing didn’t stop.	tsy nijanona izany zavatra izany
And they will always be.	ary mbola hisy foana izy ireo
Something didn’t go away right away.	zavatra tsy nandeha avy hatrany
Just wrong.	diso ihany
And he seems happier than that.	ary toa faly kokoa noho izany izy
That’s how important it is.	toy izany no zavadehibe
Go for it.	mandeha aminizany
I am a simple and easy man.	lehilahy tsotra sy mora aho
Some already exist.	efa misy ny sasany
I’ve had them before.	efa nanana azy ireo aho taloha
He is a story.	tantara izy
Absolutely happy there too.	faly tanteraka any koa
It's not that simple.	tsy dia tsotra izao
A man came.	nisy lehilahy tonga
No one did much.	tsy nisy nanao zavatra betsaka
It’s always hard.	sarotra foana izany
But in real life, you will never be enough.	saingy aminny tena fiainana dia tsy ho ampy mihitsy ianao
There is a place and time to go.	misy toerana sy fotoana mandeha
He also made a lot of money.	nahazo vola be koa
I hope that one day it will be worth it.	manantena aho fa indray andro any dia ho mendrika izany
The problem is complex.	sarotra ny olana
He was so far away that people could not look at him.	lavitra loatra izy ka tsy afaka nijery ny olona
Everyone looked good.	nijery tsara ny rehetra
It may never happen.	mety tsy ho tanteraka mihitsy izany
He loves good words.	tia ady teny tsara izy
Yes, they come quickly.	eny tonga haingana izy ireo
And many do.	ary maro no manao izany
I want to be happy.	te ho faly aho
He never told me.	tsy nilaza tamiko mihitsy izy
There is no action whatsoever.	tsy misy hetsika na inona na inona
I never thought of that again.	tsy nieritreritra izany intsony aho
He had it before.	nanana izany aloha izy
That doesn’t seem very true right now.	toa tsy dia marina loatra izany aminizao fotoana izao
He didn't need to do anything.	tsy nila nanao na inona na inona izy
There is evil in the world.	misy ny ratsy eto aminizao tontolo izao
I already had enough.	efa nanana ny ampy
But it’s not worth the idea.	saingy tsy mendrika izany hevitra izany
He is also dead.	efa maty koa
People no longer needed it.	olona tsy nila izany intsony
Another fact, thank you.	zavamisy iray hafa misaotra
Nice place and people.	tsara toerana sy olona
I didn't get there.	tsy tonga tany aho
As seen in the picture.	araka ny hita aminny sary
He alone will do it.	izy irery no hanao izany
Everyone is in the right place.	ny olona rehetra dia eo aminny toerana mety
Like more than one.	toy ny mihoatra ny iray
But money is not an issue.	tsy olana anefa ny vola
I haven't seen them yet.	mbola tsy nahita azy ireo aho
He is often there.	ao izy matetika
We are working hard on that.	miasa mafy aminizany izahay
I found it not enough.	nahita aho fa tsy ampy
All possible paths have the same potential.	ny lalana rehetra azo atao dia manana mety mitovy
And often if they get it, it’s not wrong.	ary matetika raha mahazo izany izy ireo dia tsy diso
They’re not that big, but they’re not too bad.	tsy dia lehibe izy ireo saingy tsy dia ratsy loatra
You know that too.	fantatrao fa izany koa
It all works.	miasa daholo izany
Although this is still not entirely true.	na dia mbola tsy tena marina aza izany
Otherwise, it is not a real process.	raha tsy izany dia tsy dingana marina izany
There is nothing left.	tsy misy na inona na inona intsony
But that is uncertain, and neither should it.	tsy azo antoka anefa izany ary tsy tokony ho izany koa
In the end, they loved him.	taminny farany dia tia azy izy ireo
We have the results.	manana ny vokatra izahay
Very talkative.	tena be resaka
However, he knew better than to say it.	na izany aza dia fantany tsara kokoa noho ny nilaza izany
Of course, he doesn't need that.	mazava ho azy anefa fa tsy mila izany izy
And in the past, that was certainly true.	ary taminny lasa dia azo antoka fa marina izany
I really wouldn't do that.	tsy hanao izany tokoa aho
Or what to do.	na ny zavatra atao
He did immediately.	nanao avy hatrany izy
But not for me and for him.	fa tsy ho ahy sy ho azy
They are easy to find.	mora ny mahita azy ireo
And better yet, fast.	ary ny tsara kokoa haingana
He was downstairs.	tany ambany izy
This one is good.	tsara ity iray ity
Not so much, but mine.	tsy dia betsaka fa ny ahy
So frankly, I have no choice right now.	noho izany raha ny marina tsy manana safidy aminizao fotoana izao
They do anything.	manao na inona na inona izy ireo
That is the absolute truth of the matter.	izany no zavamisy tanteraka aminny zavamisy
In general, it is not.	aminny ankapobeny tsy izany
Sometimes it is and sometimes it is not.	indraindray dia mety ary indraindray tsy
It’s so easy now, you know.	tena mora izany ankehitriny fantatrao
It’s just life.	fiainana fotsiny izany
The result is what matters.	ny vokatra no zavadehibe
He knew everything was fine.	fantany fa tsara daholo izao
There was almost nothing at the time.	saika tsy nisy na inona na inona taminizany fotoana izany
So, for sure.	noho izany azo antoka
I will never know again.	tsy ho fantany intsony aho
Part of the game.	ampahany aminny lalao
She already had the best man.	efa nanana ny lehilahy tsara indrindra izy
We will be happy again.	ho faly indray isika
Either way we have it.	aminny fomba rehetra dia manana izany
I'm not that big.	tsy dia lehibe loatra aho
No, he seemed to be no different.	tsia toa tsy nisy hafa mihitsy izy
Just the old stuff.	ny zavatra taloha ihany
He said you know that too.	nilaza izy fa fantatrao koa izany
All of these are things.	ireo rehetra ireo dia ireo zavatra ireo
See if there's anything in it.	jereo raha misy zavatra ao
He will do whatever is necessary.	hanao izay rehetra ilaina izy
That is the fact, the fact.	izany no zavamisy ny zavamisy
You also have life.	manana fiainana koa ianao
That’s where it starts now.	izay no manomboka izao
Now everyone has their own.	ankehitriny dia samy manana ny azy
She's not even pretty.	tsy tsara tarehy akory izy
They got that land, for sure.	nahazo anio tany io izy ireo azo antoka
So we can’t do that either.	noho izany dia tsy afaka manao izany koa isika
That lot works well.	izany betsaka no miasa tsara
Which is often.	izay matetika
Not many people around.	tsy dia maro ny olona manodidina
The timing was really tough.	tena mafy tokoa ny fotoana
You still love him.	mbola tia azy ianao
It could have been done easily.	azo natao mora foana ilay izy
He didn't need to think.	tsy nila nieritreritra izy
And the results are worth it.	ary ny vokatra dia mendrika izany
I don't get a word.	tsy mahazo na dia teny iray aza aho
She looked at him thinking so.	nijery azy nieritreritra izany izy
And it really is.	ary izany tokoa
Above all.	mihoatra ny zavatra rehetra
Not that they went.	tsy hoe nandeha izy ireo
But this is the real world.	fa izao no tena tontolo
Too good, actually.	tsara loatra raha ny marina
It will never be free again.	tsy ho afaka intsony izany
Things are very different.	tena samy hafa ny zavatra
They should be there.	tokony ho eo izy ireo
Anything is possible.	azo natao ny zavadrehetra
The facts of the.	ny zavamisy ao aminny
The weather is too bad.	ratsy loatra ny andro
We never had.	tsy nanana mihitsy izahay
It seems worse.	toa ratsy kokoa izany
This process should be automatic.	ity dingana ity dia tokony ho mandeha ho azy
If the.	raha ny
Either way, it’s bad.	na izany na tsy izany dia ratsy izany
I have no idea.	tsy manana hevitra kely aho
You are right, of course the facts are important.	marina ny anao mazava ho azy fa zavadehibe ny zavamisy
So we stayed there and it was good.	dia nijanona teo izahay ary tsara
They are much bigger than that.	lehibe lavitra noho izany izy ireo
He often did.	matetika izy no nanao izany
It may not be a good practice, but it works.	mety tsy fomba tsara ilay izy fa miasa
But more than that, too.	saingy mihoatra noho izany ihany koa
Maybe he liked it.	angamba tiany izany
Maybe with him.	mety miaraka aminy
Only when you need a lot of money fast.	rehefa mila vola be haingana ihany
It took a while.	nila fotoana kely izany
He said he couldn't do it.	nilaza izy fa tsy afaka manao izany
Good for everyone.	tsara ho anny rehetra
They saw another man.	nahita lehilahy hafa izy ireo
I thought that was the end.	nieritreritra aho fa izay no farany
But many more were missing.	mbola betsaka kokoa anefa no tsy nisy
This is enough for me.	ity dia ampy ho ahy
All wars become one.	lasa iray ny ady rehetra
It might work like.	mety miasa toy ny
All possible types.	ny karazana mety rehetra
Food is also available.	misy ihany koa ny sakafo
All of this needs to go automatically.	izany rehetra izany dia mila mandeha ho azy
But you're wrong, you know.	diso anefa ianao fantatrao
Everyone is very happy.	faly be daholo
We have two houses.	manana trano roa izahay
He never wanted anyone to lose their job.	tsy tiany hisy ho very asa mihitsy
New Year.	taona vaovao
And this is one of the few.	ary izany dia iray aminireo kely
And we’re glad he did.	ary faly izahay fa nanao izany izy
Because, you know only men work.	satria fantatrao fa ny lehilahy ihany no miasa
We were able to go there.	afaka nandeha tany izahay
But it works.	miasa anefa izany
It’s a matter of time.	resaka fotoana io
Yes, it could be a lot.	eny mety ho be dia be izy
You look like one.	toa iray ianao
Everything and everything.	ny zavatra rehetra sy ny zavatra rehetra
So to me, that’s not the case.	ka amiko dia tsy izany no izy
Thanks for the nice pictures.	misaotra taminny sary mahafinaritra
They don’t work.	tsy miasa izy ireo
We are very happy.	tena faly izahay
I need to go there.	mila ho any aho
It always is, therefore.	foana izany noho izany
Yes, we have to go fast.	eny tsy maintsy mandeha haingana isika
I expect great things from this one.	manantena zavatra lehibe aminity iray ity aho
You’re not there, though.	tsy eo ianao na dia
Of course there is the place.	mazava ho azy fa misy ilay toerana
See clear and concise pictures of the best products.	jereo ny sary mazava sy mazava momba ny vokatra tsara indrindra
It certainly works for some.	azo antoka fa miasa ho anny sasany izany
The immortal ones.	ireo tsy mety maty
If you don’t, you won’t do it.	raha tsy manao izany ianao dia tsy hanao izany
Of course, you are not a man.	mazava ho azy fa tsy lehilahy ianao
Words just don’t seem to be enough.	toa tsy ampy ny teny fotsiny
That was my favorite idea.	izany no hevitra nahafinaritra ahy
In fact, more than that.	raha ny marina mihoatra noho izany
I don’t want you to be alone.	tsy tiako ho irery ianao
Yes, some people do.	eny misy olona manao toy izany
If he isn’t, he isn’t.	raha tsy izy dia tsy izy
I was lost in the end.	very aho taminny farany
We haven’t done that yet.	tsy mbola nanao izany izahay
The place is not real.	ny toerana dia tsy tena izy
It just won’t do it.	tsy hanao izany fotsiny
It’s kind of kind of kind of like that.	io no karazana karazana aminny karazana azy
Everyone is having a great time.	manana fotoana mahafinaritra ny tsirairay
This is a very difficult question.	tena sarotra io fanontaniana io
He said he would not do anything bad to me.	nilaza izy fa tsy hanao zavatra ratsy ho ahy
You know it can’t.	fantatrao fa tsy afaka izany
We have come a long way since then.	lasa lavitra be isika nanomboka teo
But the two words are different.	samy hafa anefa ireo teny roa ireo
They did a good job.	nanao asa tsara izy ireo
But life is not always the same.	fa tsy mitovy foana ny fiainana
We will never be happy if you do.	tsy ho faly mihitsy izahay raha manao izany ianao
But that is not the question.	tsy fanontaniana anefa izany
There are only three of them.	telo ihany izy ireo
I see things more clearly now.	hitako mazava kokoa izao ny zavatra
It became really crowded.	lasa feno olona tokoa
If he had seen that person, that person might have seen him.	raha nahita anio olona io izy dia mety nahita azy io olona io
They are all crazy now.	adala daholo izy ireo izao
This is a very bad idea.	hevitra ratsy be izany
Did something good for me.	nanao zavatra tsara ho ahy
Then we are happy.	dia faly izahay
I think everything is there.	heveriko fa misy ny zavadrehetra
This is meant to be easy for you.	ity dia natao ho mora aminao
And so it is everywhere.	ary toy izany koa teny rehetra teny
The word is his and his alone.	azy ny teny ary azy ihany
The car came to a complete stop.	nijanona tanteraka ilay fiara
They all love one.	samy tia iray izy rehetra
Then we watched.	dia nijery izahay
He finally got what he wanted.	nahazo izay tiany ihany izy taminny farany
I haven’t been, not really.	tsy mbola nisy aho tsy tena
Now, all is well.	ankehitriny tsara ny zavadrehetra
He was immediately confused.	very hevitra avy hatrany izy
And almost all of them.	ary saika izy rehetra taminny rehetra taminy
We were fools once and for all.	adala isika indray mandeha ary izany rehetra izany
But it is still difficult.	mbola sarotra ihany anefa izany
But we never saw him.	tsy nahita azy mihitsy anefa izahay
You can’t do without it.	tsy afaka manao tsy misy azy ianao
He didn’t get any real money.	tsy nahazo vola tena izy
He does not come alone.	tsy tonga irery izy
Doing a lot of things there.	manao zavatra be dia be any
He won't be leaving too soon.	tsy ho lasa aloha loatra izy
It could be the same.	mety ho izany koa
No war, no need for immediate action.	tsy misy ady tsy mila hetsika avy hatrany
Then came another.	dia tonga ny iray hafa
Others looked at him.	nijery azy ny hafa
Ours is gone.	lasa ny anay
You don’t like what about you.	tsy tianao ny momba anao
The place is great and very beautiful.	ny toerana dia lehibe ary tena tsara tarehy
It was different, you know.	hafa ny taminizany fantatrao
Especially since it’s so different from the norm.	indrindra fa tena samy hafa aminny mahazatra
In general, this is good enough.	aminny ankapobeny dia ampy tsara izany
But you don’t want anything.	saingy tsy misy na inona na inona tianao
But no, no one in particular.	saingy tsia tsy misy olona manokana
There was no safe place for me.	tsy nisy toerana azo antoka ho ahy
These people are for you.	ireo olona ireo dia ho anao
I still do it now.	mbola manao izany aho izao
Now we went to something.	ankehitriny dia nandeha taminny zavatra iray izahay
So they said.	ka hoy izy ireo
Happy though.	faly na izany aza
I'm really wrong.	tena diso ahy
The types are the same.	mitovy ny karazana
Designed to be like that.	natao ho toy izany
This is the most recent.	io no vao haingana indrindra
I have to be with you.	tsy maintsy miaraka aminao aho
He really knows.	tena fantany
And he can do it.	ary afaka manao izany izy
There may have been other reasons.	nisy antony hafa koa angamba
Sure he is.	azo antoka fa izy
It's been a long time.	efa ela izany
And it was just fun.	ary nahafinaritra fotsiny ilay izy
You will never be alone.	tsy ho irery mihitsy ianao
Which, yes, seems really crazy.	izay eny toa tena adala
He never had a reason.	tsy nanana antony mihitsy izy
Maybe that’s true now.	angamba marina izany ankehitriny
This one, however, is something else.	ity iray ity anefa dia zavatra hafa
We need to start with them.	mila manomboka azy ireo isika
I didn’t think so either.	tsy nieritreritra izany koa aho
I really don’t.	tena tsy manao aho
It is better to do something than to do nothing.	tsara kokoa ny manao zavatra toy izay tsy manao na inona na inona
Although it will be enough.	na dia ho ampy
Some will be able to, and some will not.	ny sasany ho afaka ary ny sasany tsy
But this time did not come.	tsy tonga anefa ity fotoana ity
No one has ever done that before.	tsy mbola nisy olona nanao izany
And it really is.	ary tena izy tokoa
He is walking away from us now.	mandeha lavitra antsika izy izao
Finally, there is good news.	farany misy vaovao tsara
A new life is possible.	fiainana vaovao azo atao
It's just yours.	ny anao ihany izany
The timing couldn’t have been better.	tsy mety ho tsara kokoa ny fotoana
This may be the end.	mety ho izao no farany
Well, you can do the same to me.	eny ary afaka manao toy izany koa amiko ianao
Someone is watching me.	misy mijery ahy
The world is crazy.	adala izao tontolo izao
I see the meaning.	hitako ny dikany
We seem to be the same.	toa toy izany koa isika
She is a woman.	vehivavy iray izy
This seems to be incorrect.	hita fa tsy mety izany
Working from the inside out.	miasa avy ao anatiny
It’s a matter of ideas.	resaka hevitra io
It’s even more so.	mbola betsaka kokoa izany
Do's and don'ts.	ny atao sy ny tsy atao
However, you want to do it.	na izany aza tianao ny hanao izany
Because he’s just good.	satria tsara ihany izy
He alone could do it for her, immortal.	izy irery ihany no afaka nanao izany ho azy tsy mety maty
Of course, this is not easy.	mazava ho azy fa tsy tsotra izany
Of course, that can also be wrong.	mazava ho azy fa mety ho diso koa izany
There are three ways.	misy fomba telo
Not many can do that.	tsy maro no afaka manao izany
We could both be wrong, you know.	mety ho samy diso isika fantatrao
He was a man, and didn’t think much of it.	lehilahy izy ary tsy dia nieritreritra loatra
But you can take small steps.	saingy afaka manao dingana kely ianao
So it's not the same.	ka tsy mitovy aminy
But that is the most important thing.	izany anefa no tena zavadehibe
This is not a problem here.	tsy olana izany eto
But it was still fun.	mbola nahafinaritra ihany anefa izany
Not clear.	tsy mazava
This is one of the best games of the year.	ity no iray aminireo lalao tsara indrindra aminity taona ity
Probably the best for him.	angamba ny tsara indrindra ho azy
But none of them were right.	tsy nisy marina anefa izy ireo
He does the same.	manao toy izany koa izy
Same with the house.	mitovy aminny trano
I want to be so wrong.	te ho diso be aho
You had that way.	nanana izany fomba izany ianao
It’s wrong and it’s not right.	tsy mety izany ary tsy marina izany
I'm really not the right person.	tena tsy olona mety aho
You have to be good with money.	tokony ho tsara aminny vola ianao
Sometimes it’s really bad to be good.	indraindray dia tena ratsy ny hoe tsara
Most importantly, it’s true.	raha ny zavadehibe indrindra dia marina
See you here.	jereo eto ianao
But he is also simple.	tsotra ihany koa anefa izy
I knew he was.	fantatro fa izy no izy
If he doesn’t, you won’t.	raha tsy manao izany izy dia tsy hanao izany ianao
It’s all so easy.	mora tokoa izany rehetra izany
Good job man.	asa tsara lehilahy
You did the right thing.	nanao araka ny tokony ho izy ianao
It will not be very possible.	tsy ho azo atao loatra izany
Yes they are very different.	eny tena samy hafa izy ireo
It will not happen.	tsy ho tanteraka izany
He went very fast.	nandeha haingana be izy
There’s a lot of stuff there.	misy zavatra be dia be any
That’s the only thing that can’t be real.	izany ihany no tsy mety ho tena izy
I really saw them.	hitako tokoa izy ireo
And something was done.	ary nisy zavatra natao
We share a lot of stories.	mitovy tantara be dia be izahay
personally, you know.	manokana fantatrao
It’s not going to be a fun thing, no idea.	tsy ho zavatra mahafinaritra izany tsy misy hevitra
So, they seem too good to be true.	noho izany toa tsara loatra izy ireo ka tsy ho marina
He did it and can do both together.	nanao izany izy ary afaka manao azy roa miaraka
Whatever happens to you, you find history.	na inona na inona mahazo anao dia mahita tantara ianao
Some looked at him like a fool.	ny sasany nijery azy toy ny adala
She has grown up to be a beautiful woman.	efa lehibe izy ka vehivavy tsara tarehy
In fact, he was happy.	raha ny marina dia faly izy
He has it all.	manana izany rehetra izany izy
Yes, that’s crazy.	eny adala izany
It’s not big but mine.	tsy lehibe ilay izy fa ahy
They look like real.	toy ny tena izy ireo
I have another meal for you.	manana sakafo hafa ho anao aho
The same is true of the context today.	toy izany koa ny teny manodidina ankehitriny
And thank you.	ary misaotra anao
Not so, he said.	tsy toy izany hoy izy
However, it is not as easy as it may seem.	na izany aza tsy mora araka ny mety ho hita
But it may be close.	mety ho akaiky anefa izany
They need a story.	mila tantara izy ireo
The journey will never be different.	tsy ho hafa mihitsy ny dia
Of course, he was alone.	mazava ho azy fa irery izy
Yes, no.	eny tsy misy
It’s not easy, we have to be honest.	tsy mora izany tokony ho marina isika
You know that’s bad when it comes to that.	fantatrao fa ratsy izany raha ny momba izany
But it is too early.	saingy aloha loatra izany
And they can't.	ary tsy afaka izy ireo
Many of them are great.	maro aminizy ireo no lehibe
It was for him.	ho azy izany
Very good.	ny tena tsara
It’s not all that simple.	tsy tsotra toy izany rehetra izany
We have a little something.	manana zavatra kely izahay
But they don’t work.	tsy miasa anefa izy ireo
Now he had one.	ankehitriny dia nanana iray izy
But there are others.	mbola misy hafa koa anefa
You don’t know how hard it is to walk.	tsy fantatrao hoe sarotra ny mandeha
Everything went smoothly.	nandeha araka ny tokony ho izy ny zavadrehetra
We were all there.	efa teo daholo isika rehetra
He was very aggressive.	tena tia ady izy
Hope you like a little.	manantena fa tianao kely
See the full action here.	jereo eto ny hetsika feno
Didn't see anything.	tsy nahita na inona na inona
It all seems too complicated.	toa sarotra loatra izany rehetra izany
I know a lot.	be dia be no fantatro
I'm not here or there.	tsy eto aho na any
Although it had a good idea.	na dia nanana hevitra tsara aza izy io
That was true then, and it is still true today.	marina izany taminizany ary mbola marina izany ankehitriny
He has a lot of money.	manana vola be izy
Or maybe all of that.	na angamba izany rehetra izany
And the most fun things can’t be done.	ary tsy azo atao ny zavatra tena mahafinaritra
I love this event for everyone, not just me.	tiako ity hetsika ity ho anny rehetra fa tsy irery
I am completely new.	vaovao tanteraka aho
This one is important.	zavadehibe ity iray ity
Make sure there is room for it.	ataovy azo antoka fa misy toerana ho azy
And if they’re not, they’re fine too.	ary raha tsy izy ireo dia tsara ihany koa
We took one last step.	nanao dingana farany izahay
That woman.	io vehivavy io
Then we will do it.	dia hanao izany isika
Everything does that.	izao rehetra izao no manao izany
The world will be a more pleasant place.	ho toerana mahafinaritra kokoa izao tontolo izao
No one could do it alone.	tsy nisy olona afaka nanao izany irery
I finally found them.	hitako ihany izy ireo taminny farany
I had it.	nanana azy aho
Too much has been lost.	efa betsaka loatra ny zavatra very
The other way around doesn’t work.	tsy mandeha ny fomba hafa
Do hard work at the best of times.	manao asa mafy aminny fotoana tsara indrindra
He is bad for you.	ratsy aminao izy
Maybe not the same guy.	mety tsy io lehilahy io ihany
I think that’s great.	heveriko fa lehibe izany
The others were not there.	tsy nisy azy ny hafa
First of all, you need to find a beautiful place.	voalohany indrindra dia mila mahita toerana tsara tarehy
He knew he had to act fast.	fantany fa tsy maintsy manao zavatra haingana izy
While this is possible, it can be difficult.	na dia azo atao aza izany dia mety ho sarotra
Nothing else mattered.	tsy nisy zavadehibe hafa
He did not know exactly why.	tsy fantany tsara ny antony
I know, bad news.	fantatro vaovao ratsy
Everything is the real thing.	ny zavatra rehetra dia ny tena zavamisy
This is the most important thing.	ity ny zavadehibe indrindra
And maybe he's right.	ary angamba marina ny azy
If so, he is the last.	raha izany no izy dia izy no farany
The problem is that they are right.	ny olana dia hoe marina izy ireo
This is a big problem.	olana lehibe ity
He is still not very happy when he is wrong.	mbola tsy faly be izy rehefa diso
Maybe soon.	mety tsy ho ela
I have never seen anything like it.	tsy nahita zavatra toy izany aho
It’s all crazy.	adala daholo izany
But someone else did.	nisy olona hafa nanao izany anefa
Always that game.	foana io lalao io
There is no time to lose.	tsy misy fotoana ho very
Basically, you can’t do that idea.	aminny ankapobeny tsy afaka manao anio hevitra io ianao
They are wrong.	tsy mety izy ireo
Sure, sure, all of that right now.	azo antoka azo antoka izany rehetra izany aminizao fotoana izao
The ground is hard.	mafy ny tany
Even though he is far away, he is now closer.	na dia lavitra aza izy dia akaiky kokoa izy izao
No, I couldn't do that.	tsia tsy afaka nanao izany
Maybe they’re not very different at all.	angamba tsy tena hafa mihitsy izy ireo
But this is not true for two reasons.	tsy marina anefa izany noho ny antony roa
And he did a really good job.	ary nanao asa tena tsara izy
If only he thought of me.	raha mba nieritreritra ahy izy
That seems to be the case.	toa izany no zavamisy
Not just mine but others.	tsy ny ahy ihany fa ny anny hafa
I've seen it before.	efa nahita izany aho taloha
Not that it had to happen.	tsy hoe tsy maintsy nisy izany
We both don’t like them.	samy tsy tia azy ireo isika
See if he gets another word from me.	jereo raha mahazo teny hafa avy amiko izy
He’s with the usual.	miaraka aminny zavatra mahazatra izy
So it was a fun time.	noho izany dia fotoana nahafinaritra izany
There is work to be done.	misy ny asa atao aminizany
Or maybe.	na angamba
He has not yet died there.	mbola tsy maty tany izy
I don't have enough of him.	tsy ampy azy aho
Not part of all that money.	tsy ny ampahany aminizany vola rehetra izany
And that is true.	ary izany no marina
It can be as good as anything else.	mety tsara toy ny zavatra hafa izany
No results.	tsy misy vokatra
He could be one.	mety ho iray izy
So what matters.	ka inona no zavadehibe
But this man.	fa ity lehilahy ity
Surely you can do more.	azo antoka fa afaka manao bebe kokoa ianao
Kind of goes with it.	karazana mandeha miaraka aminy
We had fun.	nahafinaritra izahay
Not for me, man.	tsia ho ahy izany lehilahy
Nothing good.	tsy nisy zavatra tsara
Yes, these people do exist.	eny misy tokoa ireo olona ireo
I think they are beautiful too.	heveriko fa tsara tarehy koa izy ireo
Anyway, here.	na izany na tsy izany eto
I know the day.	fantatro ny andro
It’s best to start with what you already have.	tsara ny manomboka aminny efa misy
But he had plenty to eat.	nanana sakafo be dia be anefa izy
I find that to be very true.	hitako fa tena marina tokoa izany
This is the last one again.	ity indray no farany
And that’s enough for now.	ary dia ampy izany ho anny ankehitriny
That is, the situation is not too bad.	izany hoe tsy dia ratsy loatra ny zavamisy
He must have thought so, since he was alone.	azo antoka fa nieritreritra izany izy satria irery izy
We follow them.	manaraka azy ireo izahay
We should be free.	tokony ho afaka isika
It was also easier back then.	mora kokoa koa izany taminizany fotoana izany
This world belongs to him.	azy ity tontolo ity
The day has come.	tonga ny andro
The first and foremost.	ny voalohany sy farany indrindra indrindra
For many reasons, the question is difficult.	noho ny antony maro dia sarotra ny fanontaniana
Not his favorite job.	tsy ny asa tiany indrindra
The news will be coming soon.	ho avy tsy ho ela ny vaovao
In war.	aminny ady
There is no choice now.	tsy misy safidy izao
It’s better, as it should be.	tsara kokoa izany araka ny tokony ho izy
It’s more than that.	mihoatra noho izany ihany izany
But we started getting it.	saingy nanomboka nahazo izany izahay
It looks better than the picture.	toa tsara kokoa noho ny sary
We both looked away.	samy nijery lavitra izahay
For you for you.	ho anao ho anao
Finally the car went.	farany dia nandeha ny fiara
He will come.	ho tonga izy
It could be the same.	mety ho iray ihany izany
Now everyone does it.	ankehitriny dia manao izany ny rehetra
Some do things wrong.	ny sasany manao zavatra tsy mety
Because the self no longer exists.	satria tsy misy intsony ny tena
In fact, he is still there.	raha ny marina dia mbola eo ihany izy
It was really fun and exciting.	nahafinaritra sy nahafinaritra tokoa ilay izy
I was never there.	tsy nisy mihitsy aho
See also this option.	jereo koa io safidy io
The need is to start from the bottom.	ny ilaina dia ny manomboka avy any ambany
There is really no talk of it.	tena tsy misy resaka momba izany
It’s a job for men.	asa ho anny lehilahy izany
Life is only for the moment.	ny fiainana dia izao fotoana izao ihany
We also didn’t have very good food.	tsy nanana sakafo tsara be koa izahay
He had never been before.	mbola tsy teo aloha izy
They would all be there, he knew.	ho eo izy rehetra fantany
You have a problem without it.	manana olana ianao raha tsy misy izany
And you don’t see us often.	ary tsy nahita anay matetika ianao
If so, there is no need to do so.	raha izany no izy dia tsy ilaina ny manao izany
I thought of nothing.	nieritreritra na inona na inona aho
He also did a good job.	nanao asa tsara ihany koa
I see you clearly.	hitako tsara ianao
As for me, they may be right.	raha ny momba ahy dia mety ho marina izy ireo
The truth is more complicated, as usual.	ny marina dia sarotra kokoa toy ny mahazatra
However, we went anyway.	na izany aza dia nandeha ihany izahay
It's not really necessary, in fact.	tsy tena ilaina izany raha ny marina
Of course, this is not the only one.	mazava ho azy fa tsy io irery
This is the best way.	izany no fomba tsara indrindra
It was as if they were looking at us.	toy ny nijery anay izy ireo
Yes, not all the time.	eny tsy aminny fotoana rehetra izy
If beautiful.	raha tsara tarehy
The time has come for them.	tonga ny fotoana ho azy ireo
But that is the reality.	izany anefa no zavamisy
Part of me.	ampahany amiko
But no, no, everything is fine.	saingy tsia tsia tsara ny zavadrehetra
And he gets it.	ary mahazo izany izy
But it went well.	nandeha tsara anefa izany
Of course he sees it.	mazava ho azy fa mahita izany izy
This is fun.	ity no mahafinaritra
But we are never lost.	saingy tsy very mihitsy isika
Now the hard part.	ankehitriny ny sarotra
It has to be simple and easy.	tsy maintsy atao tsotra sy mora izany
You could have said that.	afaka nilaza izany ianao
The car was still moving.	mbola nandeha ihany ilay fiara
You don’t understand both.	tsy azonao izy roa
We all had so much fun.	nahafinaritra be daholo isika rehetra
This is the only option.	izao ihany no mety
But it is also not necessary.	tsy ilaina ihany koa anefa izany
However, not all is lost.	na izany aza tsy very ny rehetra
It has to be human, he told himself.	tsy maintsy olona izany hoy izy taminny tenany
It’s also an idea.	hevitra ihany koa izany
Nice to see you here.	faly mahita anao eto
You should be there too.	tokony ho eo koa ianao
He is not crazy to me.	tsy adala amiko izy
Yes they say we have to work hard.	eny hoy izy ireo fa tsy maintsy miasa mafy isika
There will be others following me.	mbola hisy hafa manaraka ahy
For people who can do more.	ho anny olona afaka manao zavatra bebe kokoa
That's right, but only a small part of it.	marina izany saingy ampahany kely aminizany
But it must be far away.	tsy maintsy lavitra anefa izany
There may be other people there as well.	mety misy olona hafa koa any
He finally arrived at night.	tonga ihany izy taminny alina
I have it all too.	manana izany rehetra izany koa aho
Next, of course.	manaraka izany mazava ho azy
He did the same one day.	nanao toy izany koa izy taminny andro iray
If a major problem is found, this is it.	raha misy olana lehibe hita dia io no izy
Something clear had to be done.	nisy zavatra mazava tsy maintsy natao
Everyone else is the same.	ny hafa rehetra dia mitovy
You can get it farther.	afaka mahazo izany lavitra kokoa ianao
It becomes meaningless.	lasa tsy misy dikany
Almost not enough.	saika tsy ampy
But it will be different.	ho hafa anefa izany
Anyway, he’s with me.	na izany na tsy izany miaraka amiko izy
He needed a lot of money.	nila vola be izy
And others.	ary ny hafa
This is not true but it does not make sense.	tsy marina izany fa tsy misy dikany
Not sure if it still exists.	tsy azo antoka raha mbola misy
Almost everything.	saika ny zavatra rehetra
And it was a fun time.	ary fotoana mahafinaritra izany
Game and good.	lalao sy ny tsara
But there was still one question.	mbola nisy fanontaniana iray ihany anefa
In each game.	aminny lalao tsirairay
So it becomes very difficult.	ka lasa sarotra be
This is good news.	vaovao tsara izany
But it seems to work.	fa toa miasa
But that's crazy.	fa adala izany
But it's not too bad.	tsy mbola ratsy loatra anefa izany
He is too right.	marina loatra izy
Thanks again for a great time.	misaotra indray taminny fotoana nahafinaritra
I think it was hard for him to do that.	heveriko fa sarotra taminy ny nanao izany
But it’s not dead yet.	saingy mbola tsy maty izany
Little things are important.	zavadehibe ny zavatra kely
Then, the time came.	avy eo tonga ny fotoana
I both had a little.	samy nanana kely aho
He went elsewhere to do the same.	nandeha tany aminny toerana hafa izy mba hanao izany
You can make it as fun as you want.	azonao atao izany ho mahafinaritra araka izay tianao
If you don’t have it, you don’t get it.	raha tsy manana ianao dia tsy azonao
We need to start doing something about it now.	mila manomboka manao zavatra momba izany isika izao
These questions are not too difficult.	tsy dia sarotra loatra ireo fanontaniana ireo
It starts small.	manomboka kely izany
It was really hard work.	tena asa mafy ilay izy
It was almost like a game to me.	saika toy ny lalao izany amiko
Maybe he's here.	angamba izy eto
I saw a lot of things.	nahita zavatra be dia be aho
It's not that simple.	tsy izany tsotra izao
It's all possible.	mety daholo izany
You know you’re not always right.	fantatrao fa tsy marina foana ianao
I think you do too.	heveriko fa manao izany koa ianao
And if he didn't, he would never be happy.	ary raha tsy nanao izany izy dia tsy ho faly mihitsy izy
There is a lot of light here.	betsaka ny mazava eto
Here you can do it in two ways.	eto dia azonao atao aminny fomba roa
They didn’t have that idea.	tsy nanana izany hevitra izany izy ireo
They are really good here.	tena tsara tokoa izy ireo eto
Never start anew.	aza manomboka vaovao mihitsy
Anyway, it seems to be the same, lately.	na izany na tsy izany toa toy izany ihany izany vao haingana
Maybe I lost my job.	angamba very asa
It didn’t matter, but they had to stop.	tsy zavadehibe fa tsy maintsy nijanona izy ireo
It's not mine.	tsy ahy izany
We can go.	afaka mandeha izahay
Didn't see the other one.	tsy nahita ny iray hafa
You need a job for that.	mila asa ianao aminizany
It seems pointless at times.	toa tsy misy dikany izany indraindray
You always have to work on it.	tsy maintsy miasa foana ianao aminizany
I'm always crazy.	adala foana aho
He should have gone anyway.	tokony ho nandeha ihany izy
If it’s too much, it’s not for you.	raha be loatra ilay izy dia tsy ho anao izany
Check it out.	mijery anio
It is also for men.	ho anny lehilahy koa izany
It can be a good thing and a bad thing.	mety ho zavatra tsara sy ratsy izany
This is fun.	mahafinaritra ity
Maybe you’re better off.	angamba ianao tsara kokoa
Fast or so.	haingana na toy izany
It seems to be the part.	toa ny ampahany
You know they will.	fantatrao fa hanao izany izy ireo
And they are for me.	ary ho ahy izy ireo
It can't do anything else.	tsy afaka manao zavatra hafa izany
But only you.	fa ianao ihany
He had to go very fast no matter what.	tsy maintsy nandeha haingana be izy na inona
If only it were that simple.	raha mba mbola tsotra ihany izany
Lots of problems.	be olana
It wasn't like that before.	tsy mba toy izany taloha
However, there were still bigger problems.	na izany aza mbola nisy olana lehibe kokoa
Because it never really existed.	satria tsy tena nisy mihitsy ilay izy
You don’t get any more accurate than this.	tsy mahazo tena marina kokoa noho ity ianao
You get a job.	mahazo asa ianao
And they can’t look at them all.	ary tsy afaka mijery azy rehetra izy ireo
I don’t want to come.	tsy te ho avy
He is more free.	afaka kokoa izy
Some do better than others.	ny sasany manao tsara kokoa noho ny hafa
It is not necessary here.	tsy ilaina izany eto
It just doesn’t seem to be enough.	toa tsy ampy mihitsy
So there are two steps.	noho izany dia misy dingana roa
You have a home and a future.	manana trano sy ho avy ianao
I am three.	telo aho
Then he finally left.	dia lasa izy taminny farany
Maybe that’s all.	angamba izany rehetra izany
I knew it right away.	tonga dia fantatro izany
We didn’t need it.	tsy nila izany izahay
They enjoyed life.	nahafinaritra azy ireo ny fiainana
Often they are not.	matetika izy ireo no tsy izany
There were no real facts.	tsy nisy zavamisy marina
I saw the face.	hitako ilay tarehy
The picture is not just a picture.	tsy sary fotsiny ilay sary
But the conversation is not so simple.	saingy tsy dia tsotra loatra ny resaka
But I didn’t.	saingy tsy nanao izany aho
Sure enough for one or two nights.	azo antoka fa ampy ho anny iray na roa alina izany
So that would often not be true.	noho izany dia tsy ho marina ny matetika
There’s a lot of time for that stuff.	misy fotoana be aminizany zavatra izany
Very easy too.	tena mora koa
It seemed certain at the time.	toa azo antoka izany taminizany fotoana izany
The years went by that way.	nandeha toy izany ny taona
Very far.	lavitra tokoa
There wasn’t much in the past.	tsy dia nisy loatra ny lasa
Such a great person.	olona lehibe toy izany
very nice night.	alina mahafinaritra be
But that’s far from a game.	saingy lavitra lalao izany
Very small work and very accurate.	asa tena kely ary tena marina
He really walks alone.	tena mandeha irery izy
But there was a small problem.	nisy olana kely anefa
He had time, years if necessary.	nanana fotoana izy taona raha ilaina
But it’s never perfect.	saingy tsy tanteraka mihitsy
I want to draw with a story.	te hanao sary miaraka aminny tantara aho
It is the same with a fool.	toy izany koa aminny adala
He had just done it again.	vao avy nanao izany indray izy
No one is in it.	tsy misy olona ao anatiny
However, it is still possible.	na izany aza mbola azo atao izany
Not that he likes it.	tsy hoe tiany izany
And he is very different.	ary tena hafa izy
And a lot of people don’t see it now.	ary betsaka ny olona tsy mahita izany ankehitriny
If you did, you know.	raha nanao izany ianao dia fantatrao
Time did not pass.	tsy nandeha ny fotoana
And some do.	ary ny sasany manao izany
We never needed it.	tsy nila izany mihitsy izahay
With all the bad, there is a lot of good.	miaraka aminny ratsy rehetra dia misy tsara be
Of course not, because he was just looking at her.	mazava ho azy fa tsy izany satria nijery azy fotsiny izy

It is never too early to do so.	tsy mbola aloha loatra ny manao izany

It’s not just about loving food.	tsy hoe tia sakafo fotsiny izany
This one is for sure, too.	ity iray ity dia azo antoka koa

And he really loved her.	ary tena tia azy tokoa izy
I had no history of war.	tsy nanana tantara momba ny ady aho
What is one thing and another.	inona no zavatra iray sy iray hafa
I would be nothing without you.	tsy nisy na inona na inona aho raha tsy nisy anao
He could not stay there.	tsy afaka nijanona teo izy
Even if it is wrong.	na dia diso aza izany
They are therefore the same.	mitovy izy ireo noho izany
There is something about this car.	misy zavatra momba ity fiara ity

It should be worth it, too.	tokony ho mendrika izany koa
I still need to work on that.	mbola mila miasa aminizany aho
I don't like it.	tsy tiako ilay izy
There were, perhaps, who did.	nisy angamba izay nanao izany
But we hope this is not the end.	saingy manantena izahay fa tsy izany no farany
Soon he will be in the world again.	tsy ho ela dia ho any aminizao tontolo izao indray izy
You become something bigger.	lasa zavatra lehibe kokoa ianao
Other places, yes.	toerana hafa eny

He is exactly like himself.	mitovy tanteraka aminny tenany izy
When it’s worth it.	rehefa mendrika izany
Not all products are suitable for everyone.	tsy ny vokatra rehetra no mety aminny rehetra
Yes, that's the right word for him.	eny izany no teny mety aminy
We will do more than that.	mbola hanao mihoatra noho izany isika
He certainly had enough money.	azo antoka fa nanana vola ampy izy
There was nothing else that could have been done.	tsy nisy zavatra hafa mety ho izany
He loves to work.	tia miasa izy
It was more fun.	nahafinaritra kokoa ilay izy
I follow.	manaraka aho
You don’t even have to do them well.	tsy mila manao azy ireo tsara akory ianao
That’s exactly why it’s unnecessary.	izany indrindra no tsy ilaina
So you will know.	ka ho fantatrao
There is something else in it, which is entirely his.	misy zavatra hafa koa ao izay azy tanteraka
I am not small.	tsy kely aho

I love all about it.	tiako daholo ny momba izany
The age doesn’t matter here.	tsy misy dikany ny taona eto
Anything else.	na inona na inona ho hafa
But they are history.	tantara anefa izy ireo
At the moment the.	aminizao fotoana izao ny
Because, of course, it’s for them.	satria mazava ho azy dia ho azy ireo izany
This is not a difficult task.	tsy asa sarotra izany
We always do, and in many ways.	manao izany foana izahay ary aminny fomba maro
There is a lot that can go wrong.	betsaka ny mety ho diso
None of that.	tsy misy aminizany
We hope you get it.	manantena izahay fa ho azonao
You don’t need me to do this for you anymore.	tsy mila ahy hanao izany ho anao intsony ianao
They seem to be doing the work.	toa manao ny asa izy ireo
It was one or the other.	iray na hafa ilay izy
It seems like a lot now.	toa be dia be izao
It’s not one of them.	tsy iray aminizy ireo izany
And then the next, and the next.	ary avy eo ny manaraka ary ny manaraka
Not a pleasant day like when I was a kid.	tsy andro mahafinaritra toy ny taminny mbola kely
I had to see him.	tsy maintsy nahita azy
But, life is more difficult now.	saingy sarotra kokoa ny fiainana ankehitriny
It can be close and personal.	mety ho akaiky sy manokana izany
Very much, in fact.	tena betsaka raha ny marina
It doesn’t make much sense if you don’t.	tsy dia misy dikany loatra raha tsy manao izany ianao
And then go and go and go more.	ary avy eo dia mandeha sy mandeha ary mandeha bebe kokoa
You, and you’ve been around for a long time.	ianao ary efa ela ianao
In fact, to me, it doesn’t make sense.	raha ny marina amiko dia tsy misy dikany izany
Everyone else is wrong.	diso daholo ny hafa
Now, you have to do yours.	ankehitriny tsy maintsy manao ny anao ianao
There was none, however small.	tsy nisy izany na dia kely aza
Both are not options for me.	samy tsy safidy ho ahy ireo
It’s not too hard for me either.	tsy dia sarotra amiko koa izany
However, some people may disagree.	na izany aza misy olona mety tsy mitovy hevitra
We need more.	mila bebe kokoa izahay
They were all big games there.	izy ireo no lalao lehibe rehetra teo
You didn’t think of anything else.	tsy nieritreritra zavatra hafa ianao
But that seems like a good thing.	toa zavatra tsara anefa izany
We all love him, and are very happy.	isika rehetra dia tia azy ary tena faly
And he is alone.	ary irery izy
This world can be easily secured.	ity tontolo ity dia mety ho mora azo antoka
Not a bad life.	tsy fiainana ratsy
I know this man well.	fantatro tsara io lehilahy io
So really bad.	ka tena ratsy
We thought so, yes.	nieritreritra izany izahay eny
Still the same problem.	mbola olana mitovy
I finally found it.	hitako izany taminny farany
That is one of the problems with this movement.	izany no iray aminireo olana aminity hetsika ity
It seems true, but it is very true, it seems wrong.	toa marina izany saingy tena marina tokoa toa diso
Of course, it was very unpleasant.	mazava ho azy fa tena tsy nahafinaritra izany
It’s all really fun, of course.	tena mahafinaritra daholo izany mazava ho azy
As time went on, more and more people saw it.	rehefa nandeha ny fotoana dia maro kokoa ny olona nahita izany
Some of them I like and some I don’t.	ny sasany aminizy ireo no tiako ary ny sasany tsy
Because the no.	satria ny no
But of course that is the wrong question.	saingy mazava ho azy fa fanontaniana diso izany
But they did not die.	saingy tsy maty izy ireo
In fact, no one looked at me at all.	raha ny marina dia tsy nisy nijery ahy mihitsy
It was made for the best.	natao ho anny tsara indrindra izany
I didn't need it.	tsy nila izany aho
No, not completely.	tsia tsy tanteraka

It’s fun now, too.	mahafinaritra koa izao
The other is not.	ny iray hafa dia tsy
It’s not just words that are made.	tsy ny teny ihany no natao
The man she loved died.	maty ilay lehilahy tiany
I don’t want to be like that.	tsy te ho toy izany aho
I hope there is a job for you.	manantena aho fa hisy asa ho anao
But now he told me there was bad news.	nilaza tamiko anefa izy izao fa misy vaovao ratsy
I know I really did.	fantatro fa tena nanao izany ny ahy
But we need it to be honest.	mila izany anefa isika mba hanao ny marina
But he also wanted to be honest.	te hanao ny marina koa anefa izy
I don't see it working well.	tsy hitako fa miasa tsara izany
And the food is new.	ary vaovao ny sakafo
Of course, this is a small amount.	mazava ho azy fa kely dia kely izany
He once worked there.	nanao asa tany izy indray mandeha
However, he will be with her after that.	na izany aza ho eo aminy izy rehefa afaka izany
They don’t work either.	tsy misy miasa koa izy ireo
That is the simple fact.	izany no zavamisy tsotra
We used to.	izahay taloha
And especially for you.	ary indrindra ho anao
Well, we have to go.	eny ary tsy maintsy mandeha
You should have seen it before.	tokony ho efa nahita izany ianao taloha
Some died.	ny sasany maty
Nothing could be easier.	tsy hisy ho mora kokoa
We don't need him.	tsy mila azy izahay
Then he went quickly.	dia nandeha haingana izy
It should be.	tokony ho izy
I find it difficult now.	hitako ho sarotra izany ankehitriny
He was foolish to do so.	adala izy nanao izany
They have me.	manana ahy izy ireo
Fast, easy and convenient.	haingana mora ary mora
You know full well that you have.	fantatrao tsara fa manana
They just don’t make sense.	tsy misy dikany fotsiny izy ireo
But everyone needs to work on it.	mila miasa aminizany anefa ny rehetra
No job is too small or too big.	tsy misy asa kely loatra na lehibe loatra
So they do.	noho izany dia manao izany izy ireo
Very different.	tena hafa
Very easy and convenient.	tena mora sy mora
He looked around and saw that he was alone.	nijery ny manodidina izy ka nahita fa irery izy
We came last of everything.	tonga farany taminny zavadrehetra izahay
They also have choices.	manana safidy koa izy ireo
And you look at me.	ary mijery ahy ianao
You are important to me.	zavadehibe amiko ianao
Yes, he was still there.	eny mbola teo izy
She fell in love with him.	lasa tia azy izy
I will see.	ho hitako
It was done for me.	natao tamiko izany
So that's not it.	ka izay no tsy
But not all are together.	tsy miaraka daholo anefa
We hope someone will come.	manantena izahay fa hisy olona ho avy
The problem is very serious.	tena zavadehibe tokoa ilay olana
And that's all it is.	ary izany ihany no izy
The days may be over.	mety ho lasa ny andro
The past does not die here.	tsy maty eto ny lasa
There is nothing ordinary or ordinary.	tsy misy zavatra mahazatra na mahazatra
But he is nothing special to me.	saingy tsy misy zavatra manokana ho ahy izy
There are people close too.	misy olona akaiky koa
My three love it.	ny ahy telo dia tia azy
The more women the better.	ny vehivavy kokoa no tsara kokoa
He is very familiar.	tena mahazatra izy
But I don’t expect him.	tsy manantena azy anefa aho
They are just doing bad things.	manao ratsy fotsiny izy ireo
In the same world.	ao aminny tontolo iray ihany
If you have to do something, do it now.	raha tsy maintsy manao zavatra ianao dia ataovy izao
I see something like that.	mahita zavatra toy izany aho
It is not easy to find him now.	tsy mora ny mahita azy ankehitriny
You have yours.	manana ny anao ianao
We look at one of them.	mijery ny iray aminizy ireo izahay
There was no other option.	tsy nisy safidy hafa
In fact, they are very small.	raha ny marina dia kely dia kely izy ireo
It was just a game.	lalao fotsiny ilay izy
As it has always been in history.	toy ny efa nisy teo aminny tantara
A little more of course.	kely kokoa mazava ho azy
I can't just thank you.	tsy afaka misaotra anao fotsiny aho
This is bad news for us.	vaovao ratsy ho anay izany
I have more pictures.	manana sary bebe kokoa aho
But these are equally vague.	saingy ireo dia mitovy tsy mazava
He always had to tell himself that.	nila nilaza taminny tenany izany foana izy
In the end, it was done.	taminny farany dia tanteraka izany
If they only knew.	raha mba fantany
Easier and more fun for both of us.	tsotra kokoa sy mahafinaritra kokoa ho antsika roa
It all becomes too much.	lasa be loatra izany rehetra izany
All good if you get it.	tsara daholo raha azonao
But he still didn’t have the full picture.	saingy mbola tsy nanana ny sary feno izy
They don’t exist at all.	tsy misy mihitsy izy ireo
I didn’t think it would be difficult for you.	tsy nieritreritra aho fa ho sarotra aminao izany
But, of course, he won’t.	saingy mazava ho azy tsy hanao izany izy
Because it’s hard.	satria sarotra
He will be.	izy no ho
However, they are very good.	na izany aza dia tena tsara izy ireo
Hope you like this work.	manantena fa tianao ity asa ity
The result is just beautiful.	ny vokatra dia tsara tarehy fotsiny
No one sees us.	tsy misy mahita antsika
Best done if you like them.	ny tsara indrindra atao raha tianao izy ireo
They are also easy and fast.	mora sy haingana koa izy ireo
Or for him.	na ho azy
Everything is working properly.	miasa araka ny tokony ho izy ny zavadrehetra
You are not happy.	tsy faly ianao
And so he had to die.	ary noho izany dia tsy maintsy maty izy
It became real.	lasa tena izy io
And work.	ary asa
Seems like it’s really big.	toy ny hoe tena lehibe
When he loves people, he really loves them.	rehefa tia olona izy dia tena tia azy
See what works.	jereo izay mety
That might be wrong, maybe not.	mety ho diso izany angamba tsy
To them, he deserves it.	ho azy ireo dia mendrika izany izy
So we are better at it now.	noho izany dia tsara kokoa aminizany isika izao
The car is not worth it.	tsy mendrika ny fiara
Right now, that doesn’t make sense.	aminizao fotoana izao dia tsy misy dikany izany
However, everyone is still working hard.	na izany aza mbola miasa mafy ny rehetra
You don't even matter.	tsy misy dikany akory ianao
We hope everyone will be free.	manantena izahay fa ho afaka ny rehetra
Although I still love him.	na dia mbola tia azy aza
This is not a close conversation.	tsy resaka akaiky izany
But it’s not the same in the end.	saingy tsy mitovy aminny farany
I started walking again.	nanomboka nandeha indray aho
And you are beautiful.	ary tsara tarehy ianao
He always had.	nanana foana izy
There is no room for anything else.	tsy misy toerana ho anny zavatra hafa
I still have a problem.	mbola manana olana iray aho
But not this thing.	fa tsy ity zavatra ity
Everything is absolutely true.	marina tokoa ny zavadrehetra
Thank you so much for doing so.	misaotra indrindra nanao izany
It all works.	mandeha daholo izany
And it didn’t make sense.	ary tsy nisy dikany izany
It's the same in life.	toy izany koa eo aminny fiainana
But it’s just like any other job.	toy ny asa rehetra ihany anefa izany
Everyone is also free to watch.	afaka ihany koa ny rehetra raha mijery
They do things for you.	manao zavatra aminao izy ireo
Others are more familiar to you.	ny hafa dia mahazatra anao kokoa
You love to do things.	tia manao zavatra ianao
He had the news.	nanana ny vaovao izy
It has to be.	tsy maintsy ho izy
It’s as good as it gets.	tsara araka izay ho azo izany
He kept coming.	tonga hatrany izy
Maybe we are.	angamba isika izany
He looks like his old self.	toa ny tenany taloha izy
He saw her and stopped.	nahita azy izy ka nijanona
As always, this can be completely accomplished.	toy ny matetika izany dia mety ho tanteraka tanteraka
The earth is dead.	maty ny tany
He didn't look at her either.	tsy nijery azy koa izy
And then the game.	ary avy eo ny lalao
It can be very hard.	mety ho mafy be izany
We are just lost.	very fotsiny isika
Not special.	tsy manokana
There is nothing good to be gained from any war.	tsy misy zavatra tsara azo avy aminny ady rehetra
It’s really hard to get the parts.	tena sarotra ny mahazo ny ampahany
But he had to do something.	tsy maintsy nanao zavatra anefa izy
The game doesn’t start very well.	tsy dia manomboka tsara ny lalao
Everyone works.	miasa ny rehetra
It may be full of small people.	mety ho feno olona kely
These problems are not new.	tsy vaovao ireo olana ireo
And still.	ary mbola izany ihany
But just the two of us.	fa izahay roa ihany
But you don’t seem to agree.	saingy toa tsy mitovy hevitra ianao
And maybe they didn’t have it.	ary angamba tsy nanana izany izy ireo
Not everyone can do this job.	tsy ny rehetra no afaka manao izany asa izany
No one saw the action.	tsy nisy nahita ny hetsika
Which makes perfect sense.	izay misy dikany tanteraka
I never got any results.	tsy nahazo vokatra mihitsy aho
But, we can only hope that it goes well.	saingy afaka manantena ihany fa mandeha tsara
It may just not work.	mety tsy miasa fotsiny
Although still small.	na dia mbola kely aza
There is nothing wrong here.	tsy misy zavatra diso eto
It looks real.	toa tena izy
Yes, it’s the same thing.	eny zavatra mitovy io
Of course, this is no longer true.	mazava ho azy fa tsy marina intsony izany
Some good choices, but some come as well.	ny safidy tsara sasany fa ny sasany tonga ihany koa
Anyway, that's a good thing.	na izany na tsy izany zavatra tsara izany
I said it could be.	hoy aho hoe mety ho izy
That’s for sure.	azo antoka fa azo antoka izany
I lost my job and it wasn’t.	very asa aho ary tsy nisy izany
And we are.	ary izahay
Don’t get me wrong it’s not all bad.	aza diso aho fa tsy ratsy daholo
He may also be superior.	mety ho ambony koa izy
He didn’t want her to be that close.	tsy tiany ho akaiky izany izy
It’s a different way.	fomba hafa izany
It’s just a small idea.	hevitra kely fotsiny ilay izy
And it’s really big.	ary tena lehibe tokoa izany
There have never been so many pictures.	mbola tsy nisy sary be dia be toy izany
He seemed to be watching her.	toa nijery azy
I could have it again.	afaka nanana izany indray aho
You can do everything right.	azonao atao tsara ny zavadrehetra
Definitely a must.	tena tsy maintsy
Not bad, of course.	tsy ratsy mazava ho azy
They are all empty.	foana izy rehetra
So we went.	dia nandeha ihany izahay
There must have been two of them.	tsy maintsy nisy roa izy ireo
They can't do anything else.	tsy afaka manao zavatra hafa izy ireo
Maybe they were telling the truth.	angamba nilaza ny marina izy ireo
Personally.	amiko manokana
That seems too much.	toa be loatra izany
Will not.	tsy hanao
But everything went well.	nandeha tsara anefa ny zavadrehetra
If it’s big.	raha lehibe izany
Especially women.	indrindra fa vehivavy
He had never been to a place like this before.	mbola tsy tany aminny toerana toa anio mihitsy izy
But we should.	saingy tokony ho isika
It hasn’t come yet.	mbola tsy tonga izany
Not all of them are good.	tsy izy rehetra no tsara
It was almost impossible.	saika tsy azo natao izany
But again, it’s going to be everywhere.	saingy indray dia ho any aminny toerana rehetra izany
Not a little but a lot.	tsy kely fa betsaka
It is not two but one.	tsy roa izany fa iray
That is, very little.	izany hoe kely dia kely
He loved it.	tiany ilay izy
It went late at night.	nandeha alina be ilay izy
But in fact it is much worse than that.	saingy raha ny marina dia ratsy lavitra noho izany
One never does that.	ny iray dia tsy manao izany mihitsy
It was a crazy job for me.	asa adala tamiko izany
But there has to be someone.	saingy tsy maintsy misy olona
This is the best.	io no tsara indrindra
I have to know.	tsy maintsy fantatro
That idea is not yours.	tsy anao io hevitra io
We shouldn’t now.	tsy tokony izao isika
He became like that.	lasa toy izany izy
We’re having fun.	mahafinaritra izahay
He was almost two.	efa ho roa izy
Of course he would have known it wasn’t.	mazava ho azy fa ho fantany fa tsy izany
In fact, they love the food.	raha ny marina dia tia ny sakafo izy ireo
The next step.	ny dingana manaraka
But it still went on.	mbola nandeha ihany anefa izany
To make it go away.	mba ho lasa izany
Maybe you will.	angamba ianao hanao izany
But there is one big problem.	saingy misy olana lehibe iray
Always work on it.	miasa aminizany foana
They can’t both have it.	tsy afaka samy manana izany izy ireo
We have to have more.	tsy maintsy manana bebe kokoa isika
There is nothing for them.	tsy misy na inona na inona ho azy ireo
Sounds really crazy.	toa adala tokoa
And then it didn’t make sense.	ary avy eo dia tsy nisy dikany
And you say, a lot of these people are good people.	ary hoy ianao maro aminireo olona ireo no olona tsara
Or what might not be his.	na izay mety tsy ho azy
I get it sometimes too.	mahazo izany koa aho indraindray
Not really fun but not bad either.	tsy tena mahafinaritra fa tsy ratsy koa
Busy, busy.	be atao be atao
This may not seem right to some.	mety ho toa tsy mety aminny sasany izany
We took another step, and then again.	nanao dingana iray hafa izahay ary avy eo indray
Of course he will come.	mazava ho azy fa ho avy izy
It’s like you’re not.	toy ny hoe tsy ianao
However, this may not be enough.	na izany aza mety tsy ho ampy izany
However, some do not.	na izany aza ny sasany tsy manao izany
It’s all him.	izy daholo izany
I am no longer a man.	tsy lehilahy intsony aho
And it could be three.	ary mety ho telo izany
We have never become a decent person in this place.	mbola tsy tonga olona mendrika aminity toerana ity mihitsy izahay
The world is more complicated than that.	sarotra kokoa noho izany izao tontolo izao
You can do it again.	afaka manao izany indray ianao
Word came that they still didn’t know.	tonga ny teny fa mbola tsy fantany
We had a lot of fun.	tena nahafinaritra be izahay
Nothing is easy here but home.	tsy misy mora eto fa trano
What and where are you.	inona ary ny toerana misy anao
The Great War is my favorite.	ny ady lehibe no tena tiako indrindra
You have made a lot of money now.	nahazo vola be ianao izao
This is because they are too good to be true.	izany dia satria tsara loatra izy ireo ka tsy ho marina
I was lost in it.	very tao aminy aho
But there is a small problem.	misy olana kely anefa
It makes too much sense.	misy dikany loatra izany
Maybe he should.	angamba izy tokony
You are in a better place than you could possibly be.	ao aminny toerana tsara kokoa noho izay mety hisy anao ianao
He was soon gone.	tsy ela dia lasa izy
And did well.	ary nanao tsara
We are beginning to see it.	manomboka mahita izany isika
But if they had, it would have been better.	fa raha nanana izy ireo dia ho tsara kokoa izany
The reason is the reason only.	ny antony dia ny antony ihany
Not two.	tsy roa
Even if he does, you are with me.	na dia manao izany aza izy dia miaraka amiko ianao
But that will not happen.	tsy hisy anefa izany
They both don’t look good.	samy tsy mijery tsara izy roa
If you do something, it’s really wrong.	raha manao zavatra dia tena tsy mety
I really don’t think they will do that.	tena tsy heveriko fa hanao izany izy ireo
You are right.	marina ianao
We were very happy about that.	tena faly izahay taminizany
We had one.	nanana iray izahay
That’s where we went wrong.	teo no diso izahay
But that may not be true.	mety tsy marina anefa izany
However, it turned out to be very good.	na izany aza dia hita fa tena tsara
It has become a classic game.	lasa lalao mahazatra izany
It just seems impossible.	toa tsy azo atao fotsiny
So see about them then.	ka jereo ny momba azy ireo avy eo
It is no longer certain.	tsy azo antoka intsony izany
They are easy to walk.	mora mandeha izy ireo
So no one sees them.	ka tsy misy mahita azy ireo
And there were many others.	ary nisy maro hafa koa
You are so great.	lehibe tokoa ianao
We have to make the journey over and over again.	tsy maintsy manao ny dia hatrany hatrany isika
Women work.	asa ny vehivavy
Now the battle is at its peak.	ankehitriny ny ady dia ambony indrindra
A little first, then a lot.	kely aloha avy eo be
He took one step and then again.	nanao dingana iray izy ary avy eo indray
I haven't done it yet.	tsy mbola nanao izany
I started it.	nanomboka izany aho
Well, it’s not perfect yet.	eny ary tsy mbola tanteraka
Here we go.	lasa izao
He just didn’t enjoy it.	tsy nahafinaritra azy fotsiny izany
It seems to work more for me than it is a fun thing to do.	toa miasa kokoa amiko izany fa tsy zavatra mahafinaritra
Still fun.	mbola mahafinaritra
It’s a job for them.	asa ho azy ireo izany
Immediately people didn’t like him.	avy hatrany dia tsy tia azy ny olona
But more importantly, what the picture is about.	fa ny zavadehibe kokoa ny zavatra ny sary dia ao
The path meant nothing to him.	tsy nisy dikany taminy ilay lalana
It would have been best for him if he hadn’t done it.	ho tsara indrindra ho azy izany raha tsy nanao izany izy
For better, or for worse.	ho tsara kokoa na ho ratsy kokoa
It’s a really fun place.	tena toerana mahafinaritra izy io
And pictures, too, sometimes.	ary ny sary koa indraindray
Now, more than ever, we have a choice.	ankehitriny mihoatra noho ny taloha isika dia manana safidy
He did not enjoy the work.	tsy nahafinaritra azy ilay asa
It turned out to be well worth it.	hita fa tena mendrika izany
They usually start when they are older.	matetika izy ireo no manomboka rehefa lehibe
I like the big picture.	tiako ilay sary lehibe
See you again.	ho hita indray
He said it was for me.	nilaza izy fa ho ahy izany
He thought of something completely different.	nieritreritra zavatra hafa tanteraka izy
It soon became history.	tsy ela izy dia tantara
Some of them will be completely meaningless.	tsy hisy dikany mihitsy ny sasany aminizy ireo
He loves me.	tiany aho
I never thought he would do that.	tsy nieritreritra mihitsy aho hoe hanao izany izy
Now he had a good idea.	ankehitriny dia nanana hevitra tsara izy
Basically you have to do it.	aminny ankapobeny dia tsy maintsy manao izany ianao
The people who were in their place.	ireo olona izay teo aminny toerana nisy azy ireo
No problem I said.	tsy misy olana hoy aho
However, it is not the only one of these things.	na izany aza tsy ny iray aminireo zavatra ireo ihany
Everything seems fine, he said.	toa tsara daholo ny zavadrehetra hoy izy
And it will not be difficult for us.	ary tsy ho sarotra ho antsika izany
It’s, like, yours.	izany toy ny ny anao
It is us.	isika izany
I never did, for sure.	tsy nanao izany mihitsy aho azo antoka
The latter is true.	marina ity farany
It’s just money.	vola fotsiny io
I need one too.	mila iray koa aho
I also disagree on two things.	tsy mitovy hevitra aminny zavatra roa koa aho
He suits me well.	mety tsara amiko izy
We are dead.	efa maty izahay
The latter, however, seems difficult to find.	toa sarotra hita anefa io karazana farany io
Then you will get it.	dia ho azonao
That sounds really good.	toa tena tsara izany
Nobody wants to be here.	tsy misy olona te ho eto
I never saw him again.	tsy hitako indray izy
It’s not really worth it to me.	tsy tena mendrika izany amiko
This is also a common approach.	izany koa dia fomba mahazatra
Faster, he thought.	haingana kokoa hoy izy nieritreritra
Everything looks good on him.	mijery azy tsara ny zavadrehetra
I work too hard.	miasa mafy loatra aho
But of course they did nothing.	saingy mazava ho azy fa tsy nanao na inona na inona izy ireo
He owns the money.	izy no manana ny vola
The idea is better than the real thing.	tsara kokoa noho ny tena izy ilay hevitra
I have a quick question.	manana fanontaniana haingana aho
You always need it.	mila izany foana ianao
You really are the reason.	ianao tokoa no antony
The desired result is the first game seen.	ny vokatra ilaina dia ny lalao voalohany hita
Well, about that.	eny ary momba izany
The most important thing to me is the conversation.	ny tena zavadehibe amiko dia ny resaka
And thank you very much.	ary misaotra indrindra
This one is better.	tsara kokoa ity iray ity
He is, in fact, a fool.	izy raha ny marina dia adala
I got that money.	nahazo io vola io aho
Maybe something like that.	angamba misy zavatra toy izany
Some of it is special.	ny sasany aminizany dia manokana
He is still working on it.	mbola miasa aminizany izy
This guy gets it.	ity lehilahy ity dia mahazo izany
Everything seemed possible.	toa azo natao ny zavadrehetra
There was something else as well.	mbola nisy zavatra hafa koa
All of these are good and good.	ireo rehetra ireo dia tsara sy tsara
And no, actually.	ary tsia raha ny marina
They are wrong.	diso hevitra izy ireo
You could be a completely stupid person.	mety ho olona adala tanteraka ianao
He said it was his.	nilaza izy fa azy io
It seems too hard to talk about them.	toa mafy loatra ny resaka momba azy ireo
History is meaningless.	tsy misy dikany ny tantara
Or maybe more than one.	na mety mihoatra ny iray
They can do it quickly.	afaka manao izany haingana izy ireo
But in the end it comes down to a choice.	saingy aminny farany dia tonga aminny safidy
I told myself to get lost.	nilaza tamiko aho mba ho very
We don’t work for him.	tsy miasa ho azy izahay
We didn’t get a game.	tsy nahazo lalao izahay
We should have done it, but no one did.	tokony ho nanao izany izahay saingy tsy nisy nanao izany
Good, good man.	tsara lehilahy tsara
The past and the present are meaningless.	tsy misy dikany ny lasa sy ny ankehitriny
But this is very wrong.	tena diso hevitra anefa izany
I had never seen this man except on the news.	mbola tsy nahita anio lehilahy io mihitsy raha tsy taminny vaovao
But he didn't know that.	fa tsy fantany izay
And it’s not hard to see that.	ary tsy sarotra ny mahita izany
I wondered what could be done.	nieritreritra aho hoe inona no azo atao
The reason seems clear.	toa mazava ny antony
It doesn’t make sense to me either.	samy tsy misy dikany amiko izany
But now the years have passed.	efa lasa anefa izao ny taona
I enjoyed him at times.	nahafinaritra ahy izy indraindray
of them.	aminizy ireo
However, this is a top -notch product.	na izany aza dia vokatra ambony indrindra izany
It’s not enough to look at it.	tsy ampy ny mijery azy
He is not a fool.	tsy olona adala izy
Not too bad, but not too good either.	tsy tena ratsy fa tsy dia tsara koa
The top is great.	lehibe ny ambony
This idea is not new.	tsy vaovao io hevitra io
But he is your man.	fa lehilahy anao izy
It seemed so close to him.	toa akaiky azy tokoa izany
That's a bad word.	teny ratsy izany
It was really not designed specifically.	tena tsy natao manokana ilay izy
However, for many, this is not the case.	na izany aza aminny maro dia tsy izany no izy
But all three are not necessary.	tsy ilaina anefa izy telo ireo
And if he dies.	ary raha maty izy
Sometimes life is meaningless.	indraindray ny fiainana dia tsy misy dikany
He may have told her.	mety efa nilaza taminy izy
No one needed it.	tsy nisy nila izany
I'm just a man.	lehilahy fotsiny aho
I think you know.	heveriko fa fantatrao
He had a special reason for doing so.	nanana antony manokana taminizany izy
Without it, there is none.	raha tsy misy izany dia tsy misy
It was hard work and a difficult life.	asa mafy sy fiainana sarotra izany
It is for them.	ho azy ireo izany
I was there sometimes.	teo aho indraindray
And it won’t be.	ary tsy ho izany
You know there are a lot of them.	fantatrao fa be dia be izy ireo
I was so happy to see that.	tena faly aho nahita izany
It just seems true.	toa marina fotsiny izany
You still need to do that.	mbola mila manao izany ianao
I don’t know if he will do that.	tsy fantatro raha hanao izany izy
Now, you started earlier.	ankehitriny nanomboka teo aloha ianao
Still going well.	mbola mandeha tsara
With some work.	miaraka aminny asa sasany
You really can’t go wrong.	tena tsy mety diso ianao
But it will be good.	saingy ho tsara izany
All of these and many more.	ireo rehetra ireo sy ny maro hafa
He really has people.	tena manana olona izy
It’s not safe for him here.	tsy azo antoka ho azy ny eto
Maybe not now.	angamba tsy izany izao
Or we can do something else.	na afaka manao zavatra hafa isika
Some people just walk down the aisle.	ny olona sasany dia mandeha aminny lalana fotsiny
Many of the options seem pointless.	maro aminireo safidy no toa tsy misy dikany
You can see the story from here.	afaka mahita ny tantara avy eto ianao
They said no, then yes.	tsia hoy izy ireo avy eo dia eny
You’re the only one who didn’t do it.	ianao ihany no tsy nanao izany
And it could be.	ary mety ho
This method, however, is generally not available.	ity fomba ity anefa dia tsy misy aminny ankapobeny
And then you just enjoy it.	ary avy eo dia mahafinaritra anao fotsiny izany
There is so much more that can be done.	mbola betsaka kokoa no azo atao
But that is enough.	ampy fotsiny anefa izany
The conversation became complete.	lasa tanteraka ny resaka
But you are missing one thing.	saingy tsy ampy zavatra iray ianao
Nice, all around.	mahafinaritra manodidina
More than men.	mihoatra noho ny lehilahy
It was still in him.	mbola tao aminy izany
It's the same with you.	toa anao koa izany
That is not the idea.	tsy izay no hevitra
I found two things quickly.	nahita zavatra roa haingana aho
They are fools.	izy ireo no adala
It's not too hard.	tsy sarotra loatra ilay izy
He wanted things to be good.	tiany ho tsara ny zavatra
They are happy to see immediate results.	faly izy ireo mahita vokatra eo no ho eo
But it is difficult.	mafy anefa izany
But here they are hurting us.	fa eto izy ireo no manao ratsy antsika
But one day that will be true.	fa indray andro any dia ho marina izany
And he was lost.	ary very izy
However, this has not yet happened.	mbola tsy tanteraka anefa izany
So that's the problem.	ka izay no olana
And, of course, it’s not clear.	ary mazava ho azy dia tsy mazava
They both can’t have it.	tsy afaka manana izany izy roa
It has always been like that.	efa toy izany foana izany
There are no women, he said.	tsy misy vehivavy hoy izy
I may not have that approach, but some men do.	mety tsy manana anio fomba io aho fa ny lehilahy sasany dia mety
There is nothing like it but there is also.	tsy misy toa azy fa misy ihany koa
Yes, if very good.	eny raha toa ka tena tsara
There is a difficult problem here.	misy olana sarotra eto
He would not have seen her alone.	tsy ho nahita azy irery izy
But it’s more than just talk.	saingy mihoatra lavitra noho ny resaka fotsiny izy
To be on everyone.	mba ho eo aminny tsirairay
We have never seen him before.	mbola tsy nisy nahita azy mihitsy izahay
In fact, it is an easy task.	raha ny marina dia asa mora izany
Also, they can’t get a place.	ary koa tsy afaka mahazo toerana izy ireo
Just do it fast.	ataovy haingana fotsiny
And he left.	ary lasa izy
And it could be even better.	ary mety ho tsara kokoa koa aza
Either he's crazy or.	na adala izy na
That may be the problem.	izay angamba no olana
It became a part of me.	lasa ampahany amiko izany
He was a man who really loved her.	olona tena tia azy izy
But they certainly have an idea.	saingy azo antoka fa manana hevitra izy ireo
That’s great.	izany no lehibe
But look now.	fa jereo izao
The same is true.	mitovy aminizany koa
But of course we don’t do that for men.	saingy mazava ho azy fa tsy manao izany ho anny lehilahy izahay
This is the usual question.	io no fanontaniana mahazatra
We can now begin to see why.	afaka manomboka mahita ny antony isika izao
It went away from him.	lasa lavitra azy ilay izy
However, the options are not great.	na izany aza ny safidy dia tsy lehibe
I didn't see you there.	tsy hitako teo ianao
Not the pretty either.	tsy ilay tsara tarehy koa
it is not the same.	tsy mitovy aminy izany
And some others.	ary ny sasany hafa
Too much work.	asa be loatra
Anyone who goes there can see it for themselves.	izay mandeha any dia afaka mahita izany ho azy manokana
Yes, not often.	eny tsy matetika
The word is not special at all.	tsy misy manokana mihitsy ilay teny
It's not mine.	tsy ahy io
That is a question of fact.	izany dia fanontaniana ny zavamisy
These can be very good too.	mety ho tena tsara koa ireo
No, he has something else now.	tsia manana zavatra hafa izy izao
Don't do that to me.	aza atao amiko izany
Maybe we will go there.	angamba ho any isika
You didn't get a job.	tsy nahazo asa ianao
He will love everyone.	ho tia ny olona rehetra izy
Surely you can make that idea.	azo antoka fa afaka manao izany hevitra izany ianao
It is yet to come.	mbola ho avy izany
They are neither good nor bad.	izy ireo dia samy tsy tsara na ratsy
Now he wouldn’t do it for her.	ankehitriny dia tsy hanao izany ho azy izy
The car is there.	ao ny fiara
So here's what.	ka izao no inona
But there is a problem.	misy olana anefa izany
But a woman works on a part of herself.	saingy ny vehivavy iray dia miasa aminny ampahany aminny tenany ihany
But there was a big problem with that.	saingy nisy olana lehibe iray taminizany
Where there was.	izay nisy
Maybe they can do it.	angamba afaka manao izany izy ireo
Only two are possible.	roa ihany no azo atao
They are easier.	mora kokoa izy ireo
But they are better than none.	saingy tsara kokoa noho ny tsy misy izy ireo
I have a reason here.	misy antony aho eto
I can't come.	tsy afaka tonga aho
He does it to me.	manao izany amiko izy
Look around if you can.	jereo ny manodidina raha azonao atao
It’s easy for them now, he thought.	mora ho azy ireo izao hoy izy nieritreritra
He had a lot of time.	nanana fotoana betsaka izy
We had never done that before.	mbola tsy nanao izany mihitsy izahay teo aloha
This is not a difficult idea.	tsy hevitra sarotra izany
And they all told him.	ary samy nilaza izany taminy ny olona rehetra
Not there but there.	tsy any fa any
She was there, and she was beautiful.	teo izy ary tsara tarehy izy
And not really necessary.	ary tsy tena ilaina
Which is good, because it’s not small.	izay tsara satria tsy kely
Not his then.	tsy azy avy eo
But more than that.	fa mihoatra noho izany
She doesn't seem to like that picture.	toa tsy tiany io sary io
It’s so fun it doesn’t seem real.	tena mahafinaritra ka toa tsy tena izy
But they are gone.	saingy lasa izy ireo
Maybe he can’t.	angamba tsy afaka izy
But they went farther.	lasa lavitra kokoa anefa izy ireo
You still like it.	mbola tianao
If you’re not too much.	raha tsy dia be loatra ianao
We have a difficult conversation.	manana resaka sarotra izahay
But they did get there.	tonga tany anefa izy ireo taminny farany
It was a very insignificant land.	tany tena tsy misy dikany izy io
I am two people.	olona roa aho
It works really well for me.	tena miasa tsara ho ahy izany
Don’t be too crazy about that.	aza adala loatra aminizany
Not lost.	tsy very
Or at any time.	na aminny fotoana rehetra
He already knew her well.	efa fantany tsara izy
First, it is not true.	voalohany tsy marina izany
So, everyone and everything is in its place.	noho izany ny tsirairay sy ny zavadrehetra dia eo aminny toerana misy azy
And to me.	ary amiko
That he can have me.	ny hoe afaka manana ahy izy
It’s hard to watch.	sarotra ny mijery azy
Look at this woman.	mijery ity vehivavy ity
But there are others.	misy anefa ny hafa
Things don’t seem to be going well.	toa tsy mandeha ny zavatra mahazatra
But everything else is also important.	zavadehibe koa anefa ny zavatra hafa rehetra
I think everything comes naturally.	heveriko fa tonga ho azy ny zavadrehetra
I don’t think they should be like that.	heveriko fa tsy tokony ho toy izany izy ireo
It's a good story, but it's not real.	tantara tsara ilay izy fa tsy tena izy
For some, it may be a job.	raha ho anny sasany dia mety ho asa
These are the clearer ways.	ireo no fomba mazava kokoa
Both don’t like small talk.	samy tsy tia resaka kely
We may be there one day.	mety ho any tokoa isika indray andro any
Far from everything.	lavitra ny zavadrehetra
I hope you are happy.	manantena aho fa ho faly ianao
Made a bigger step once.	nanao dingana lehibe kokoa indray mandeha
At your convenience.	aminny mety aminao
And he is not with me.	ary tsy misy amiko izy
It's all in the wrong place.	any aminny toerana tsy mety daholo
It doesn't go far.	tsy mety lavitra akory
You don’t really know that.	tsy fantatrao marina izany
The night is now theirs.	efa azy ireo izao ny alina
But this one.	fa ity iray ity
He could be really good.	mety ho tena tsara izy
So, it should be a lot of fun.	noho izany tokony ho mahafinaritra be izany
There was nothing again.	tsy nisy na inona na inona indray
He is doing good things.	manao zavatra tsara izy
But not all products are good.	saingy tsy ny vokatra rehetra no tsara
I've got three.	efa nahazo telo aho
I had a great life.	nanana fiainana lehibe aho
It seemed so easy when he did.	toa mora tokoa izany rehefa nanao izany izy
It was almost as if there was no idea.	saika toy ny tsy nisy hevitra
I thought, going around.	nieritreritra aho mandeha any ny manodidina
Or the next day.	na ny andro manaraka
And even if it’s hard.	ary na dia mafy aza izany
I hope that’s what works for him.	manantena aho fa izay no mety aminy
They need me there.	mila ahy any izy ireo
You will love it.	ho tianao izany
I know we are not alone.	fantatro fa tsy irery isika
There are so many possibilities.	be dia be ny mety
We were not around.	tsy teo akaiky teo izahay
Look, always look.	mijery mijery foana
There is nothing for me here.	tsy misy na inona na inona ho ahy eto
But no more than that.	fa tsy mihoatra noho izany
He looked down again.	nijery ny ambany indray izy
He stayed in this little house.	nijanona tao aminity trano kely ity izy
But they see no other option.	saingy tsy mahita safidy hafa izy ireo
And maybe he was one, then.	ary angamba izy dia iray taminizany
The same thing applies here.	mitovy aminizany koa ny resaka eto
Now the way and the way.	aminizao fotoana izao ny fomba sy ny fomba
They can do more with that.	afaka manao bebe kokoa aminizany izy ireo
What a beautiful sight.	tena tsara ny zavatra hita
We will do the same.	hanao azy koa isika
There are things either for the best or for the worst.	misy zavatra na ny tsara indrindra na ny ratsy indrindra
Some do it, some don’t.	ny sasany manao izany ny sasany tsy manao izany
And there were others.	ary nisy hafa koa
Both bad and right.	ratsy roa sy izay mety
I think they still do things like that.	heveriko fa mbola manao zavatra toy izany
It has always been difficult for me.	sarotra tamiko foana izany
It’s just important that it’s a good idea.	zavadehibe fotsiny fa hevitra tsara izany
A small part of the reason is the wrong job choice.	ny ampahany kely aminny antony dia ny safidy asa diso
It could be a man or a woman.	mety ho lehilahy na vehivavy izany
It’s been bad for a long time.	efa ela be no ratsy
But that doesn't make sense at all.	tsy misy dikany mihitsy anefa izany
I know.	fantatro aho
These are the only two options.	ireo ihany no safidy roa
To me, it’s even worse.	amiko dia ratsy kokoa izany
We wouldn’t have come far without you.	tsy ho tonga lavitra izahay raha tsy teo ianao
This is not a safe method at all.	tsy fomba azo antoka mihitsy izany
That is, made a good story.	izany hoe nanao tantara tsara
I know you won’t.	fantatro fa tsy hanao izany ianao
Then came the real fun.	dia tonga ny tena mahafinaritra
This is difficult for many people.	sarotra ho anny olona maro izany
But many more loved him.	betsaka kokoa anefa no tia azy
The process is going well.	mandeha tsara ny dingana
There is no road around it.	tsy misy lalana manodidina azy
And now they come, finally.	ary ankehitriny dia tonga izy ireo farany
There will be more on this.	mbola hisy bebe kokoa momba izany
We walk around him.	mandeha manodidina azy izahay
It had to do a lot, you should know.	nila nanao be dia be izany tokony ho fantatrao
They don’t need you.	tsy mila anao izy ireo
That’s the only real thing.	izany ihany no tena izy
Not on time.	tsy aminny fotoana
I should love him.	tokony ho tia azy aho
Nothing more than that.	tsy misy mihoatra noho izany
The fight was very hard, he told her.	tena mafy ny ady hoy izy taminy
But you don’t.	saingy tsy manao izany ianao
Such is unnecessary or necessary.	ny toy izany dia tsy ilaina na ilaina
Yes, war is a good time, that is.	eny fotoana mahafinaritra ny ady izany hoe
It’s really a close look.	tena mijery akaiky tokoa izany
They may have already done so.	mety efa nanao izany izy ireo
Here, for you.	eto ho anao
I really don’t have a face.	tena tsy manana tarehy aho
It is now possible.	azo atao izao
We’re not so sure.	tsy dia azo antoka loatra izahay
He will do it last.	izy no hanao izany farany
You expect too much.	manantena be loatra ianao
But not everyone is like that.	tsy mba toy izany anefa izy aminny olona rehetra
About everything, it seems.	momba ny zavadrehetra toa
But the journey is not far.	tsy lavitra anefa ny dia
He didn't think either.	tsy nieritreritra koa izy
That's the right way to go.	izany no fomba mety
Not if you are a woman.	tsy raha vehivavy ianao
And it should be the same.	ary tokony ho toy izany koa
If you are very hard, even if they exist.	raha toa ka sarotra be ianao na dia misy aza izy ireo
This is an unusual thing.	zavatra tsy mahazatra izany
One had three.	ny iray dia nanana telo
Not yours, not mine, his.	tsy anao tsy ny ahy ny azy
I've seen it before.	efa hitako aloha izany
We all look at him.	mijery azy daholo isika
It’s just too easy.	tena mora loatra izany
That's where the differences come from.	eo no tsy mitovy hevitra
It shouldn’t be bad.	tsy tokony ho ratsy
All of these reasons are very good.	tena tsara daholo ireo antony ireo
Not a pleasant place.	tsy toerana mahafinaritra
Don't do it to them now.	aza atao aminizy ireo izao
Both work.	samy miasa
But that is often the case.	matetika anefa izy no toy izany
It is needed now, today.	ilaina izany ankehitriny anio
You already exist.	efa misy ianao
We just have to see it.	tsy maintsy mahita izany fotsiny isika
Maybe, just maybe.	angamba angamba fotsiny
Those are two questions for them.	fanontaniana roa ho azy ireo izany
The same goes for two years.	toy izany koa ny roa taona
That’s too much for many.	be loatra ho anny maro izany
But when it started, it went away.	fa rehefa nanomboka dia nandeha
This works in general and in particular.	izany dia miasa aminny ankapobeny sy manokana
Not really, but it should be.	tsy tena fa tokony ho izany
The battle is tough.	sarotra ny ady
Great, actually.	lehibe raha ny marina
Thanks and good job !.	misaotra ary asa tsara
And again, no.	ary indray tsia
This is the best of the best.	ity no tsara indrindra aminny tsara indrindra
No more found.	tsy hita intsony
There is something really wrong here.	misy zavatra tena tsy mety eto
And this is the good news.	ary izao no vaovao tsara
I haven't seen him in a long time.	efa ela aho no tsy nahita azy
Of course, it's not the same.	mazava ho azy fa tsy mitovy ilay izy
This is the best you can get.	io no tsara indrindra azonao
First for me.	voalohany ho ahy
It’s just a kind of job.	karazana asa ihany izany
But it is also wrong.	diso koa anefa izany
But I really know it’s not.	fa tena fantatro fa tsy izany
He is something else.	zavatra hafa izy
I'm not simple.	tsy tsotra aho
And he stopped and looked around.	dia nijanona izy ka nijery manodidina
And not because of money.	ary tsy noho ny vola
Just look at me and see.	jereo fotsiny aho dia jereo
You are enough for me.	ampy ahy ianao
It was very important to me.	tena lehibe tamiko izany
You are a great man.	lehilahy lehibe ianao
So, that’s where we are.	noho izany toy izany ny toerana misy antsika
Sometimes they seem to be everywhere.	indraindray izy ireo dia toa eny rehetra eny
Usually not.	matetika tsy izany
Not meant to be.	tsy natao ho
And it can’t die fast.	ary tsy mety maty haingana
And the speed is better.	ary ny haingana dia tsara kokoa
She really likes him, she said to herself.	tena tiany izy hoy ny tenany
Or age.	na ny taona
We have others.	manana hafa izahay
But it could be very low in the future.	saingy mety ho ambany be izany aminny ho avy
I really enjoyed it too.	tena nahafinaritra ahy koa ilay izy
He did not go until there was a fight.	tsy nandeha izy raha tsy nisy ady
I love seeing fun games.	tiako ny mahita lalao mahafinaritra
This is not the first time.	tsy voalohany izany
He had one.	nanana iray izy
Not even part of the word.	tsy ampahany aminny teny akory
Basically, we follow people in everything.	aminny ankapobeny manaraka ny olona aminny zavatra rehetra izahay
Maybe not you.	angamba tsy aminao
you are alone, you have grown up.	irery ianao efa lehibe
Or maybe he didn’t like it.	na angamba tsy tiany izany
Because you don’t exist.	satria tsy misy ianao
Not too bad, actually.	tsy ratsy loatra raha ny marina
They are not the same as you and me.	tsy mitovy amiko sy ianao izy ireo
He became difficult.	lasa sarotra izy
Don't do that to me.	aza manao toy izany amiko
It was clear and obvious, it was real.	mazava sy mazava ilay izy tena nisy
By itself.	aminny tenany manokana
We work harder than ever and are always happy.	miasa mafy kokoa noho ny taloha izahay ary faly foana
Both did not look.	samy tsy nijery
Close to me.	akaiky ahy
Thanks everyone.	misaotra ny rehetra
We get the news from them.	mahazo ny vaovao avy aminizy ireo izahay
We need two of them.	mila roa aminizy ireo izahay
We may do worse.	mety hanao zavatra ratsy kokoa isika
I love this thing.	tiako ity zavatra ity
You must be with me now.	tsy maintsy miaraka amiko ianao izao
It's the same for everyone.	mitovy aminny rehetra izany
I see a lot of people around you.	mahita olona maro manodidina anao aho
You have to do it in a special way.	tsy maintsy manao izany aminny fomba manokana
He had no idea now.	tsy nanana hevitra izy izao
I think there are some.	heveriko fa misy ny sasany
No, he is good.	tsia tsara izy
The hardest step is to start doing it.	ny dingana sarotra indrindra dia ny manomboka manao izany
So they are not the same.	noho izany dia tsy mitovy izy ireo
But you don't have to.	tsy mila manao izany anefa ianao
But that is a lot of trouble.	olana maro be anefa izany
That should be safe.	tokony ho azo antoka izany
You have been, and never come.	efa nisy ianao ary tsy tonga mihitsy
Now that makes more sense.	ankehitriny dia misy dikany kokoa izany
Lots of news.	be dia be ny vaovao
Now it is the same.	aminizao fotoana izao dia toy izany ihany koa
Worst of all, he was absolutely right.	ny ratsy indrindra taminizany dia marina tanteraka izy
And it’s not the money.	ary tsy ny vola izany
First, you have to get that money.	voalohany tsy maintsy mahazo anio vola io ianao
This is true in many places.	marina izany any aminny toerana maro
I need you out of here now.	mila anao tsy ho eto aho izao
I finally stopped.	nijanona ihany aho
They see problems, of course.	mahita olana izy ireo mazava ho azy
I'm confused here.	very hevitra aho eto
I would love to do it with you.	tiako ny manao izany miaraka aminao
Maybe it was something else.	angamba zavatra hafa ilay izy
That is everything.	izany hoe ny zavadrehetra
We hope you get it !.	manantena izahay fa azonao
No need, need.	tsy mila mila
There is nothing better than this.	tsy misy tsara noho ity
Yes, maybe just one word.	eny teny iray ihany angamba
And it died.	ary maty izany
He will still be gone.	mbola ho lasa izy
I was confused all the time and place.	very hevitra ny fotoana sy ny toerana rehetra aho
That is the guarantee.	izany no antoka
I need someone like that.	mila olona mitovy aminizany aho
It's not right here.	tsy mety izany eto
It is a process alone.	dingana irery izany
I'm not happy about that.	tsy faly aminizany aho
Maybe it could be better.	angamba mety ho tsara kokoa izany
It is also available.	izy io koa dia misy
I was very crowded.	tena feno olona ny ahy
That is not enough here.	izay no tsy ampy eto
They have done this before.	efa nanao izany izy ireo taloha
We are who we are.	isika no misy antsika
He came at a different time because of him.	tonga taminny fotoana hafa izy noho izy
All of this is very recent.	tena vao haingana izany rehetra izany
It is not about us.	tsy momba antsika izany
But no one loves me either.	tsy misy tia ahy koa anefa
They were the only ones who did it.	izy ireo ihany no nanao izany
He had to go too.	tsy maintsy nandeha koa izy
This year, it won’t be.	aminity taona ity dia tsy hisy izany
But not for long.	tsy dia ela anefa
There should be something more here, he said.	tokony hisy zavatra bebe kokoa eto hoy izy
That’s a lot.	betsaka izany
You are not very pretty.	tsy dia tsara tarehy ianao
We never do that.	tsy manao izany mihitsy izahay
These are bad days.	andro ratsy ireo
People like that, you never know.	ny olona toy izany tsy fantatrao mihitsy
At first, there was nothing.	taminny voalohany tsy nisy na inona na inona
And below are two photos.	ary eo ambany dia misy sary roa
Yes, it looks like one.	eny toa iray ity
Then they become a big issue of the day.	avy eo izy ireo dia lasa olana lehibe aminny andro
This is not new either.	tsy vaovao koa izany
But it never works.	saingy tsy miasa mihitsy izany
We all have time.	manana fotoana isika rehetra
In fact, this is the biggest news about the war.	raha ny marina io no vaovao lehibe indrindra momba ny ady
It seems to be from above.	toa avy any ambony izany
But they did and here we are.	saingy nanao izany izy ireo ary eto isika
It looked like that.	nijery toy izany
It’s the same thing.	zavatra iray ihany io
Yes, nothing can be done about it.	eny tsy nisy azo natao taminizany
The time is near.	efa akaiky ny fotoana
It’s really hard work.	asa mafy tokoa izany
There are many others as well.	misy olona maro hafa koa
Then everyone watches.	dia mijery ny rehetra
But he doesn’t do anything about it.	saingy tsy manao na inona na inona momba izany izy
There he said it.	teo izy no nilaza izany
Got privacy.	nahazo ny fiainana manokana
It will be more difficult for them.	ho sarotra kokoa ho azy ireo izany
In a distant place, they lost their way.	tany aminny toerana lavitra dia very lalana izy ireo
He can get all the money he wants.	afaka mahazo ny vola rehetra tiany izy
What are you .	inona ianao
In reality, however, this is not clear.	tsy mazava mihitsy anefa izany raha ny marina
I haven't seen him yet.	mbola tsy nahita azy
You are free.	afaka ianao
Some of them are special.	misy aminizy ireo manokana
So it’s important to him.	noho izany dia zavadehibe ho azy izany
He may have it.	mety manana izany izy
This sounds like a stupid question.	toa toy ny fanontaniana adala izao
Maybe not right now, maybe you haven’t done it yet.	angamba tsy aminizao fotoana izao angamba mbola tsy nanao izany ianao
And it’s really crazy.	ary tena adala mihitsy
We had to stop.	tsy maintsy nijanona izahay
The good with the bad.	ny tsara miaraka aminny ratsy
However, the food was never a problem.	na izany aza tsy nisy olana mihitsy ny sakafo
He will never be like that.	tsy ho toy izany mihitsy izy
It doesn’t exist, and it doesn’t.	tsy misy izany ary tsy mety
He might have done something nice for me.	mety ho nanao zavatra tsara tamiko izy
Of course, it’s more than a game.	mazava ho azy fa mihoatra noho ny lalao izany
You can't come here.	tsy afaka tonga eto ianao
But so is the earth.	toy izany koa anefa ny tany
What a day.	andro inona
But he never came.	tsy tonga mihitsy anefa izy
This has become my favorite time of the day.	io no lasa fotoana tiako indrindra aminny andro
But there are many more.	mbola maro kokoa anefa izany
Little ones go a long way in this process.	ny kely dia mandeha lavitra aminity dingana ity
There never seemed to be any truth.	toa tsy nisy marina mihitsy
But he said it as clearly as the day.	saingy nilaza izany mazava tsara toy ny andro izy
They have to get it.	tsy maintsy mahazo izany izy ireo
I know the picture.	fantatro ilay sary
This question was not before.	tsy teo aloha io fanontaniana io
But it doesn’t look pretty.	saingy toa tsy tsara tarehy
He is very important.	tena zavadehibe tokoa izy
It was also small.	kely koa ilay izy
Not so.	tsy toy izany
I'm a little happy.	somary faly aho
Maybe he should have done it.	angamba tokony ho nanao izany izy
You really matter.	tena misy dikany ianao
Around here or there.	manodidina eto any ho any
If he loves her.	raha tia azy izy
People here work really hard.	tena miasa mafy ny olona eto
He is never here when needed.	tsy eto mihitsy izy rehefa ilaina
Then the story goes.	dia mandeha ny tantara
This is a good place.	toerana tsara io
But at other times it is.	fa aminny fotoana hafa izany
Good and bad if you will.	tsara sy ratsy raha tianao
But not much to see.	saingy tsy dia betsaka ny ho hita
They are not like that at all.	tsy toy izany mihitsy izy ireo
The more options, the better.	ny safidy bebe kokoa ny tsara kokoa
But there are some.	misy anefa ny sasany
Sometimes it seems great.	indraindray dia toa lehibe
Very close too.	tena akaiky koa
I just arrived.	vao tonga aho
That’s where the choice is clear.	eo no mazava ny safidy
Not really about it.	tsy tena momba azy io
Too fast.	tena haingana loatra
I usually don’t go for these things.	matetika aho no tsy mandeha aminireo zavatra ireo
Here, everything is as it should be.	eto araka ny tokony ho izy ny zavadrehetra
Worth it though, a really nice night.	mendrika izany anefa tena alina mahafinaritra
I came here for another reason.	tonga eto aho noho ny antony hafa
We always do the same.	manao izany foana koa izahay
The situation today is very different.	hafa mihitsy ny zavamisy ankehitriny
He had no home.	tsy nanana trano izy
No one is completely good or bad.	tsy misy olona tsara na ratsy tanteraka
And they all work well, well.	ary izy rehetra dia miasa tsara tsara
Thanks again and see you around.	misaotra indray ary mahita anao manodidina
Just some of them.	ny sasany aminizy ireo ihany
She is beautiful and really loves me.	tsara tarehy izy ary tena tia ahy
They said nothing more could be done.	nilaza izy ireo fa tsy misy azo atao intsony
This is generally not necessary.	tsy ilaina izany aminny ankapobeny
No, he liked it.	tsia anefa tiany izany
But he knew that was not enough.	fantany anefa fa tsy ampy izany
It will not happen now.	tsy ho tanteraka izany ankehitriny
You need to look at it.	mila mijery azy ianao
The first idea is correct.	marina ny hevitra voalohany
They deserve it.	mendrika azy ireo izany
The reason is not always clear.	tsy mazava foana ny antony
Very good for us.	tena tsara ho antsika
But it is about him, not about him.	momba azy anefa izany fa tsy azy
Everyone who sees mine needs one.	izay rehetra mahita ny ahy dia mila iray
I don't want to be alone anymore.	tsy te ho irery intsony aho
And it’s not the same.	ary tsy mitovy izany
They all went.	nandeha izy rehetra
Which isn’t too much.	izay tsy dia be loatra
I need it now more than you know.	mila izany aho izao mihoatra noho ny fantatrao
It’s like nothing really matters.	toy ny hoe tsy misy zavatra tena zavadehibe
And you can’t go wrong.	ary tsy mety diso ianao
It can be fun.	mety ho mahafinaritra izany
I can't go beyond that.	tsy afaka mihoatra izany aho
Which may not be what you want.	izay mety tsy izay tianao
He comes from money.	avy aminny vola izy
This idea makes no sense.	tsy misy dikany io hevitra io
Two days.	roa andro
Maybe another man.	angamba lehilahy hafa
He also told me that something was wrong.	nilaza tamiko koa izy fa misy zavatra tsy mety
Because we are different.	satria samy hafa isika
In just a little bit.	aminny kely fotsiny
Maybe there is another reason as well.	angamba misy antony hafa koa
It's not just a war against evil.	tsy ady aminny ratsy fotsiny
It seems hard to do.	toa sarotra ny manao izany
They were almost there.	saika teo izy ireo
He stopped and looked at her.	nijanona izy ary nijery azy
Good stuff, he thought.	zavatra tsara hoy izy nieritreritra
Don’t do anything like that.	aza manao na inona na inona toy izany
Now anything is possible.	ankehitriny ny zavadrehetra dia azo atao
I'm not there yet.	mbola tsy eo aho
There was a real path.	nisy lalana tena izy
I became empty.	lasa tsy nisy olona aho
You are far from me.	lavitra ahy ianao
And they didn’t, they certainly didn’t like that guy.	ary tsy nanao izany izy ireo azo antoka fa tsy tiany io lehilahy io
I also have a question for you.	manana fanontaniana aminao koa aho
I needed a safe place.	nila toerana azo antoka aho
It’s a real idea.	tena hevitra io
And he wants her to be in a safe place.	ary tiany ho any aminny toerana azo antoka izy
They are very happy without it.	tena faly izy ireo raha tsy misy izany
But this story is much more than that.	mbola mihoatra lavitra noho izany anefa ity tantara ity
Not both.	tsy izy roa
I couldn’t even think about them.	tsy afaka nieritreritra momba azy ireo akory aho
If they don’t, it’s unnecessary.	raha tsy manao izany izy ireo dia tsy ilaina izany
I will definitely do it again.	tena hanao izany indray aho
They were the only two there.	izy roa ihany no tao
He also didn’t have a big idea.	tsy nanana hevitra lehibe koa izy
You need us.	mila anay ianao
That’s crazy, he thought.	adala izany hoy izy nieritreritra
I kind of did that.	somary nanao izany ihany aho
It all seems good.	toa tsara daholo izany rehetra izany
He could have done it for no reason.	afaka nanao izany tsy misy antony izy
You are not in the right place.	tsy eo aminny toerana tsara ianao
It’s not that we don’t get it.	tsy hoe tsy mahazo izany isika
Another easy option.	safidy mora hafa
You definitely come up with a fun story.	azo antoka fa tonga miaraka aminny tantara mahafinaritra ianao
Yours could be one of them.	ny anao dia mety ho iray aminizy ireo
But everything is going well.	saingy mandeha tsara ny zavadrehetra
You are mine now.	ahy ianao izao
This guy is completely crazy.	adala tanteraka ity lehilahy ity
They got bad news.	nahazo vaovao ratsy izy ireo
Thank you for making it as fun and easy as possible.	misaotra anao nanao azy ho mahafinaritra sy mora araka izay azo atao
It didn’t go as usual.	tsy nandeha toy ny mahazatra izany
The news went fast.	nandeha haingana ny vaovao
But the people around him.	fa ny olona manodidina azy
I had a big problem getting it.	nanana olana lehibe aho nahazo azy
Maybe not the wrong person.	mety tsy ilay olona diso
He did not say no.	tsy nilaza izy hoe tsia
Didn't look a little different.	tsy nijery hafa kely
But this task will not be easy.	tsy ho mora anefa izany asa izany
This, in general, is very true.	izany aminny ankapobeny dia tena marina
Or that it should be.	na hoe izany no tokony ho izy
We are very close.	tena akaiky izahay
But he still came.	saingy mbola tonga ihany izy
The men were very happy.	faly be ny lehilahy
And so he died again, for her.	ary noho izany dia maty indray izy ho azy
Everything inside is perfect now, however.	ny zavadrehetra ao anatiny dia tanteraka ankehitriny na izany aza
Especially if it's someone close to you.	indrindra raha olona akaiky anao ilay izy
He is better and bigger than he is.	tsara kokoa sy lehibe noho izy izy
Now you are more than a man.	ankehitriny ianao dia mihoatra ny lehilahy
He is not very good.	tsy tena tsara izy
Thank you for that.	misaotra anao izay ihany
None of them are stupid.	tsy misy adala aminizy ireo
You may be able to find a way.	mety ho afaka mahita lalana
It should come to me when.	tokony ho tonga amiko izany rehefa
There is a world with nothing here.	misy izao tontolo izao tsy misy na inona na inona eto
He can't, never will.	tsy afaka izy tsy hanao izany mihitsy
You can do the same.	afaka manao toy izany koa ianao
Neither will be easy.	samy tsy ho mora izany
Stupid question, really.	fanontaniana adala tena
You know what you are to me.	fantatrao hoe inona ianao amiko
And sometimes, you just don’t understand things.	ary indraindray tsy azonao mihitsy ny zavatra
And of course, all of this will not be easy.	ary mazava ho azy tsy ho mora izany rehetra izany
Not yet.	tsy mbola nisy
Hard, he said.	mafy hoy izy
And there is no right place.	ary tsy misy toerana mety
Then you will.	dia ho ianao
It was good and fun, but I didn’t like it.	tsara sy nahafinaritra ilay izy saingy tsy tiako
The words inside are inside.	ny teny ao anatiny dia ao anatiny
It’s not you anymore.	tsy ianao intsony izany
Do the work.	ataovy ny asa
One of those, of course.	iray aminireo mazava ho azy
And of course it will happen.	ary mazava ho azy fa ho tanteraka izany
He does the same for me.	manao izany ho ahy koa izy
But he can't be wrong.	tsy mety diso anefa izy
These are absolutely true.	marina tanteraka ireo
They don’t start once.	tsy indray mandeha izy ireo no manomboka
That might be enough.	mety ho ampy izany
To me, it seems fast.	amiko dia toa haingana izany
He did even more.	mbola nanao bebe kokoa aza izy
They took the first step, and still do.	nanao ny dingana voalohany izy ireo ary mbola nanao izany
That is for sure.	izay no tena azo antoka
People are never happy.	tsy faly mihitsy ny olona
And in fact, he didn’t.	ary raha ny marina tsy nanao izany izy
This game does that a lot.	ity lalao ity dia manao izany be dia be
He should have been there.	tokony ho teo izy
He didn’t want her to do that.	tsy tiany hanao izany izy
Nothing is better or faster.	tsy misy zavatra tsara kokoa na haingana kokoa
Of course it’s about choice.	mazava ho azy fa momba ny safidy
He is not dead, he is dead.	tsy maty izy fa efa maty
But he could not walk.	tsy afaka nandeha anefa izy
That's all there is.	izay ihany no misy
People have gone too far.	lasa lavitra loatra izany ny olona
I don't need anything from you.	tsy mila na inona na inona aminao aho
It seems to be a thing of the past now.	toa lasa zavatra taloha izany ankehitriny
It can’t be both.	tsy mety ho izy roa
This does not seem to be an easy task.	toa tsy asa mora anefa izany
This car is very solid.	mafy be io fiara io
Well, we are good.	eny ary tsara izahay
This is something new.	zavatra vaovao izany
I should have had nothing for myself.	tokony tsy nanana na inona na inona ho ahy manokana aho
We are busier than ever.	be atao kokoa noho ny teo aloha izahay
Certainly not for everyone.	azo antoka fa tsy ho anny rehetra izany
No, he didn't say that.	tsia tsy nilaza izany izy
You can also do two.	afaka manao roa ihany koa ianao
I needed to see them.	nila nahita azy ireo aho
Maybe not too much, but it suits me.	mety tsy dia be loatra fa mety amiko
And he said, yes, it should be.	ary hoy izy eny tokony ho izany
It seems like maybe too.	toa izany ihany koa angamba
He had problems of his own.	nanana olana ho azy manokana izy
He said he didn’t have to.	nilaza izy fa tsy manana
It just becomes pointless.	lasa tsy misy dikany fotsiny izany
But I can't do that.	saingy tsy afaka manao izany aho
But it also required hard work.	nila asa mafy koa anefa izany
Of course, it has to go by itself.	mazava ho azy fa tsy maintsy mandeha ho azy io
A lot of men do that.	betsaka ny lehilahy manao izany
Make yours clear.	ataovy mazava tsara ny anao
And the possibilities are endless.	ary ny mety tsy misy farany
For the night.	ho anny alina
Not good at all, actually.	tsy tsara mihitsy raha ny marina
Maybe he knew something he didn’t know.	angamba nisy zavatra tsy fantany angamba no fantany
No, however.	tsia na izany aza
Both stories were untrue.	samy tsy nisy marina ny tantara
He said they were not too far away.	nilaza izy fa tsy dia lavitra loatra izy ireo
Two, no more.	roa tsy misy intsony
They are often right.	matetika izy ireo no marina
It always seemed crowded.	toa feno olona foana
It could go too far.	mety ho lasa lavitra loatra izany
I know them well.	fantatro tsara izy ireo
They are there when you need them.	eo izy ireo rehefa mila azy ireo ianao
She is a grandmother.	bebe izy
Whether it’s worth it, or not.	na mendrika izany na tsia
If this is the only way.	raha io ihany no lalana
It will only be one.	izy io ihany no ho iray
He seems to be the right man to do that.	toa izy no lehilahy mendrika hanao izany
Because you don’t have it.	satria tsy manana izany ianao
We had a great time.	nanana fotoana mahafinaritra izahay
It is this.	dia ity
I am very alone.	tena irery aho
We get into a fight with him.	mahazo ady aminy izahay
Anyway, two ideas.	na izany na tsy izany hevitra roa
We are already different.	efa samy hafa isika
But this is not always true or necessary.	tsy marina foana anefa izany na ilaina
You can’t get anything more than that.	tsy afaka mahazo na inona na inona mihoatra azy ianao
Years ago.	taona maro lasa izay
In fact, he almost never did.	raha ny marina dia saika tsy nanao izany mihitsy izy
We hope so.	manantena izany izahay
But the meaning is clear.	saingy mazava ny dikany
Now they get nothing.	ankehitriny dia tsy mahazo na inona na inona izy ireo
It’s the hardest.	dia ny tena mafy
It will be worth it.	ho mendrika izany
But even then it can’t be wrong.	fa na izany aza tsy mety diso
The houses are beautiful.	tsara tarehy ireo trano
The event was very exciting.	tena faly ny hetsika
We have been there before.	efa tany izahay taloha
I had never seen anything like it before.	mbola tsy nahita zavatra toy izany mihitsy aho taloha
Whatever seems necessary.	na inona na inona toa ilaina
Or maybe simpler than that.	na angamba tsotra kokoa noho izany
It would be worse than that.	ho ratsy kokoa noho izany izany
With such work.	miaraka aminny asa toy izany
But not the first time.	tsy voalohany anefa
It may take longer than that.	mety ho ela kokoa noho izany
And there seems to be no end.	ary toa tsy misy farany
Mine is good too.	tsara ihany koa ny ahy
It will never make sense.	tsy hisy dikany mihitsy
Everything is different.	samy hafa daholo
I didn’t, right.	tsy nanao izany aho marina
There are more options with them now.	misy safidy bebe kokoa miaraka aminizy ireo izao
The present is gone.	efa lasa ny ankehitriny
Check it out sometimes.	jereo izany indraindray
That kind of fact.	izany karazana zavamisy izany
No one could do anything.	tsy nisy afaka nanao na inona na inona
But he seemed to be driving at night.	toa nandeha fiara anefa izy taminny alina
Good stuff here.	zavatra tsara eto
But it seems so.	toa izany anefa izany
So he might be there again.	ka mety ho any indray izy
He is ours more than we are.	izy no antsika mihoatra noho isika
He is also rarely seen.	izy koa dia tsy hita matetika
Very nice guy.	lehilahy tena mahafinaritra
Once upon a time the day went by.	indray mandeha dia lasa andro ny andro
I thought about it a lot.	nieritreritra momba izany matetika aho
And not before.	ary tsy teo aloha
So that should be enough for now.	noho izany dia tokony ho ampy izany aminizao fotoana izao
So it came to me.	ka tonga amiko izany
The same thing is often true.	matetika koa no marina ilay resaka
But that will never happen.	tsy hisy mihitsy anefa izany
If he’s good at it, that’s all.	raha tsara aminizany izy dia izay ihany
He is not the first, and he will not be the last.	tsy izy no voalohany ary tsy ho farany
It comes to you quickly.	tonga aminao haingana izany
Yes, they make good money.	eny mahazo vola tsara izy ireo
For them, this is just another day.	ho azy ireo dia andro hafa fotsiny izao
Life was hard then.	tena mafy ny fiainana taminizany
Not at this stage.	tsy aminity dingana ity
It should come immediately.	tokony ho avy hatrany
Both, but at best.	izy roa fa tsara indrindra
Do it right.	ataovy tsara
And no two are alike.	ary tsy misy roa mitovy
The truth is he had it.	ny marina dia nanana izany izy
It was a really beautiful place.	tena toerana tsara tarehy ilay izy
I didn’t think much at first.	tsy nieritreritra be aho taminny voalohany
And if he didn’t, it wasn’t a problem for him.	ary raha tsy nanao izany izy dia tsy olana taminy izany
I want to go upstairs.	te ho any ambony aho
Overall, very happy.	aminny ankapobeny tena faly
That he loves me.	ny hoe tia ahy izy
Very similar, but simpler.	tena mitovy fa tsotra kokoa
And he loved her, for her.	ary tiany izy ho azy
He didn’t have enough.	tsy nanana ny ampy izy
Not a bad idea at all.	tsy hevitra ratsy mihitsy
And you know he still had it.	ary fantatrao fa mbola nanana izany izy
But that is the worst.	fa izay no ratsy indrindra
Of course, opinions vary on this point.	mazava ho azy fa tsy mitovy ny hevitra momba io hevitra io
We have a big problem here.	manana olana lehibe isika eto
Life will be better for all of them there.	ho tsara kokoa ho azy rehetra any ny fiainana
However, sometimes.	na izany aza indraindray
And it's been a long time.	ary efa ela izany
I don't like him here.	tsy tiako eto izy
It doesn’t seem too difficult.	toa tsy sarotra loatra
This is the final result !.	ity no vokatra farany
But for everyone.	ho anny tsirairay anefa
But nothing was lost.	tsy nisy very anefa
We always go.	mandeha foana izahay
he is as low as possible.	ambany araka izay azo atao izy
Now it will be seen.	aminizao fotoana izao dia ho hita izany
He would not be there.	tsy ho teo izy
I know I have it.	fantatro fa manana izany
That's not going.	izany no tsy mandeha
We all really love you.	tena tia anao izahay rehetra
Those words no longer meant much to him.	tsy nisy dikany taminy intsony ireo teny ireo
We don’t need any special products.	tsy mila vokatra manokana isika
You can do it in any way.	azonao atao aminny fomba rehetra
It’s not meant to be.	tsy natao ho izy io
But it wasn’t like me.	tsy toy ny ahy anefa izany
We arrived.	tonga izahay
He was completely lost.	very lalana tanteraka izy
Great place, they say.	toerana lehibe hoy izy ireo
But he was real.	tena nisy anefa izy
Then this is the end.	dia izao no farany
It may be simple, but for them.	mety ho tsotra izany fa ho azy ireo
There is no story without someone doing the same.	tsy misy tantara raha tsy misy manao toy izany
That wasn't the worst of it.	tsy izany akory no ratsy indrindra taminizany
So here we are.	ka eo isika izao
It’s the same with the reality of it.	mitovy aminny zavamisy ao aminy
He knew it could be difficult for people.	fantany fa mety ho sarotra ho anny olona izany
I did a job once.	nanao asa aho indray mandeha
I had to stop thinking like that.	tsy maintsy nijanona tsy nieritreritra toy izany intsony aho
But here again, that is not the question.	saingy eto indray dia tsy io no fanontaniana
They shouldn’t have done it, of course.	tsy tokony ho nanao izany izy ireo mazava ho azy
He was there because he wanted to be there.	teo izy satria te ho eo
No, more than that.	tsia mihoatra noho izany
Because everyone is beautiful.	satria tsara tarehy ny olona rehetra
We are not sure of any of us on this earth.	tsy azo antoka na dia iray aza isika eto aminity tany ity
I love it all.	tiako daholo izany rehetra izany
But, that’s it.	saingy izany no izy
There are now three of them.	telo izy ireo izao
It started with a question.	nanomboka taminny fanontaniana izany
You’ve done everything else.	efa nanao ny zavatra hafa rehetra ianao
Looked around.	nijery manodidina
He had to think more.	tsy maintsy nieritreritra bebe kokoa izy
They all look.	mijery izy rehetra
Just a little goes a long way.	ny kely fotsiny dia lasa lavitra be
Things still have to be done.	mbola tsy maintsy atao ny zavatra
War is bad.	ratsy ny ady
Everything is fast now.	haingana ny rehetra ankehitriny
Nice and personal.	tsara sy manokana
It made him think.	nieritreritra azy izany
Not so good either.	tsy dia tsara koa
They made a beautiful meal.	nanao sakafo tsara tarehy izy ireo
He had seen it before.	efa nahita izany izy taloha
This is where I am.	izany no toerana misy ahy
He looked at you.	nijery anao izy
Watch the world go by.	mijery izao tontolo izao mandeha
It’s a familiar place to us.	toerana mahazatra anay izany
Even if he likes it.	na dia tiany aza izany
See what you like.	jereo izay tianao
I came here for that reason.	tonga eto aho noho izany antony izany
We watched.	nijery izahay
Like, all of them.	toy ny izy rehetra
I can’t do it anymore, I don’t want to do it anymore.	tsy afaka manao intsony aho tsy te hanao intsony
There is nothing better you can do for her.	tsy misy zavatra tsara kokoa azonao atao ho azy
Yes some are easy, some are too easy.	eny misy mora dia misy mora loatra
Maybe do the right thing.	mety manao ny marina
There was no other choice for us.	tsy nisy safidy hafa ho anay
They are the product.	izy ireo no vokatra
In reality, however, things are not so simple.	raha ny zavamisy anefa dia tsy dia tsotra loatra ny zavatra
Went a little.	nandeha kely
It’s very special now.	tena manokana izany ankehitriny
The choice is clear.	mazava ny safidy
This is a place of choice.	toerana safidy io
Or there will be a meal next.	na hisy sakafo manaraka
As for them.	raha azy ireo
You do something else.	manao zavatra hafa ianao
The end result always seems to be not enough.	toa tsy ampy ny vokatra farany foana
But these two.	fa ireo roa ireo
Time seemed to stand still.	toa nijanona ny fotoana
There are many things that can be done.	maro ny zavatra azo atao
The work is not difficult.	tsy misy sarotra ny asa
And that’s a big problem.	ary olana lehibe izany
Everyone had something in common.	samy nanana zavatra teo aminny hafa ny tsirairay
The idea of ​​the first method is as follows.	ny hevitra momba ny fomba voalohany dia izao manaraka izao
Everything went easy and fast.	nandeha mora sy haingana ny zavadrehetra
You may not like me.	mety tsy tianao aho
It's been a long time now.	efa ho ela izy izao
They may have an idea of ​​all this.	mety manana hevitra momba izany rehetra izany izy ireo
He doesn’t need to look but do it.	tsy mila mijery izy fa manao izany
In fact, many people died.	betsaka ny olona maty raha ny marina
Not just for me.	tsy ho ahy ihany
But you’re not that big.	saingy tsy dia lehibe loatra ianao
It is often difficult to start quickly.	matetika dia sarotra ny manomboka haingana
We enjoyed everything.	nahafinaritra anay ny zavadrehetra
I think something is wrong.	heveriko fa misy zavatra tsy mety
He is not special.	tsy manokana izy
Life is hard sometimes, sometimes good.	mafy indraindray ny fiainana indraindray tsara
You know, part of the game.	fantatrao ampahany aminny lalao
It was not hard to find them.	tsy sarotra ny nahita azy ireo
What's the point? 	inona no hevitra
He had many years.	nanana taona maro izy
The former is the best.	ny voalohany no tsara indrindra
I want to know the truth.	tiako ho fantany ny marina
Many of me have told me that.	maro taminny ahy no nilaza izany tamiko
No, he died.	tsia maty izy
The truth is a little harder than that.	ny marina dia somary sarotra kokoa noho izany
It's just between you and me.	eo amiko sy ianao ihany ity
The two faces.	ny tarehy roa
Many said.	dia hoy ny maro
A little, though.	kely na izany aza
There is a battle between good and evil.	misy ady eo aminny tsara na ny ratsy
It’s better than the others.	tsara kokoa noho ny hafa izany
A small part came.	nisy ampahany kely tonga
Everything is moving fast.	mandeha haingana ny zavadrehetra
It is not at all.	tsy izany mihitsy no izy
Great place.	toerana lehibe
We can find more suitable people.	afaka mahita olona mety kokoa isika
But something came to me.	saingy nisy zavatra tonga tamiko
What a wonderful idea.	izay hevitra mahafinaritra
It just had to be done.	tsy maintsy natao fotsiny izany
Something has to be done, of course.	misy zavatra tsy maintsy atao mazava ho azy
You know you are.	fantatrao fa ianao
The same is true in other lands.	toy izany koa ny tany aminny tany hafa
He is not a real person.	tsy tena olona izy
It really doesn’t make sense.	tena tsy misy dikany tokoa izany
The earth did not.	tsy nanao izany ny tany
Action is a problem.	olana ny hetsika
Nothing came of it.	tsy nisy na inona na inona tonga
Too much talk.	be loatra ny resaka
We have come a long way with this type of event.	efa lasa lavitra be io karazana hetsika io izahay
Once he did something good.	indray mandeha izy dia nanao zavatra tsara
But they had no choice.	tsy nanana safidy anefa izy ireo
If they want to do that, that’s fine.	raha te hanao izany izy ireo dia tsara izany
It has to be.	tsy maintsy izany tokoa
This is not a safe car.	tsy fiara azo antoka io
Look at this question.	jereo ity fanontaniana ity
It seems so easy.	toa mora tokoa izany
Not sure about the others.	tsy azo antoka ny momba ny hafa
And it doesn’t seem very accurate.	ary toa tsy dia marina loatra ilay izy
However, it’s not as fun there.	na izany aza tsy toy ny mahafinaritra ny any
They never did a very good job.	tsy nanao asa tena tsara mihitsy izy ireo
He could no longer do it.	tsy afaka nanao intsony izy
You really aren’t my type.	tena tsy karazana ahy ianao
I love the style.	tiako ny fomba
Of course it will.	mazava ho azy fa ho izany
It’s so much worse.	tena ratsy kokoa izany
I just had to have them.	tsy maintsy nanana azy ireo fotsiny aho
He soon found something.	tsy ela dia nahita zavatra izy
The men arrived.	tonga ny lehilahy
Always hard.	mafy foana
Of course you will.	mazava ho azy fa ho avy ianao
And no, he doesn’t need money.	ary tsia tsy mila vola izy
But it must be completely different.	tsy maintsy ho hafa tanteraka anefa izany
And it was gone.	ary lasa izany
It is a question of fact.	fanontaniana momba ny zavamisy izany
Well, maybe that’s the idea.	eny angamba izany no hevitra
I love this job.	tiako ity asa ity
It’s harder than it should be.	sarotra kokoa noho ny tokony ho izy izany
To me, that is true.	amiko dia marina izany
Yes, parts are true.	eny marina ny ampahany
Full of news.	feno vaovao
The same action must be taken with each.	ny hetsika mitovy dia tsy maintsy atao aminny tsirairay
Now it’s good and fast.	aminizao fotoana izao dia tsara sy haingana
But they soon had it.	tsy ela anefa izy ireo no nanana azy
So all the time he is.	ka ny fotoana rehetra dia izy
Sometimes it’s fun to make mistakes.	indraindray mahafinaritra ny diso
There are two problems with this approach.	misy olana roa aminity fomba ity
Bad here.	ratsy eto
Maybe that’s not a good idea.	angamba tsy hevitra tsara izany
And the work is hard, really hard.	ary sarotra ny asa tena sarotra
I think it can and should be true.	heveriko fa mety ary tokony ho marina izany
And this is special.	ary manokana ity
We are so glad you came.	faly be izahay fa tonga ianao
I saw him do it.	hitako manao izany izy
It couldn’t be easier.	tsy mety ho mora kokoa
In fact, the game isn’t too bad.	raha ny marina dia tsy ratsy loatra ny lalao
He had two cars.	nanana fiara roa izy
Or they just won’t get there.	na tsy ho tonga any fotsiny izy ireo
And the reason is clear.	ary mazava ny antony
See where it should be.	jereo ny toerana tokony hisy azy
There may be both somewhere.	mety misy izy roa any ho any
It doesn’t matter to everyone.	tsy misy dikany ny tsirairay
Not too many questions, no, not too many.	tsy be fanontaniana tsia tsy be loatra
Thanks for nothing.	misaotra aminny tsy misy
Look at him.	jereo izy
I look at this man.	mijery ity lehilahy ity aho
He knows what he wants.	fantany izay tiany
Or the house itself.	na ny trano mihitsy
It seemed almost endless.	toa saika tsy nisy farany
Women did the same.	nanao toy izany koa ny vehivavy
Many people have one and not the other.	olona maro no manana ny iray fa tsy ny iray hafa
However, there are a lot of words.	na izany aza be dia be ny teny
That can make a lot of sense.	mety hisy dikany be izany
Although they are not visible.	na dia tsy hita aza izy ireo
We just do what he wants.	manao izay tiany fotsiny isika
I have nothing here.	tsy manana na inona na inona aho eto
And again, everything is bad.	ary indray ratsy daholo ny rehetra
The car did not stop.	tsy nijanona ilay fiara
That's all that was done.	izay ihany no natao
Coming next year.	ho avy aminny taona ho avy
But you are going well.	saingy mandeha tsara ianao
All the men are dead now.	maty daholo izao ny lehilahy rehetra
However, it became bad.	na izany aza dia lasa ratsy
I looked at him hard.	nijery azy mafy aho
However, it still works well.	na izany aza dia mbola miasa tsara
There must be one.	tsy maintsy misy ny iray
But you don’t need it.	tsy mila izany anefa
He did not go easily.	tsy nandeha mora foana izy
They have a clear picture.	manana sary mazava tsara izy ireo
But no one was there.	tsy nisy olona anefa
So you can pretty much see it all from him.	noho izany dia azonao atao tsara ny mahita izany rehetra izany avy aminy
You have an idea.	manana hevitra ianao
The worst.	ny tena ratsy indrindra
At some point, you have to make it easier.	aminny fotoana iray dia tsy maintsy manao izany mora kokoa ianao
All these ideas come from people.	avy aminny olona ireo hevitra rehetra ireo
At all times, there is nothing.	aminny fotoana rehetra tsy misy na inona na inona
I need someone who needs me.	mila olona mila ahy aho
That might be fun for me.	mety ho mahafinaritra ahy izany
Everyone is very important.	tena zavadehibe ny olona tsirairay
That time was even worse.	mbola ratsy kokoa aza izany fotoana izany
There is nothing without them.	tsy misy na inona na inona raha tsy misy azy ireo
There was.	nisy
It’s about reality.	momba ny zavamisy izany
Look here, now and then.	jereo eto izao sy izao
There was a car.	nisy fiara
He really knows that.	tena fantany izany
He never had a problem with that.	tsy nanana olana mihitsy taminizany
Of course, he didn’t have it.	mazava ho azy fa tsy nanana izany izy
It's not okay if you go.	tsy mety raha mandeha ianao
He doesn’t deserve it.	tsy mendrika azy izy
But they shouldn’t do both.	tsy tokony hanao ny roa anefa izy ireo
It’s fun here.	mahafinaritra ny eto
We have to do it again.	tsy maintsy manao izany indray isika
They are both free.	samy afaka izy ireo
We are all here.	eto daholo isika rehetra
This is sometimes true.	marina izany indraindray
Someone always stayed there.	nisy olona nijanona tao foana
It’s always about him.	momba azy foana izany
Yes, we are not.	eny tsy izany isika
Two days from now.	roa andro manomboka izao
This one didn’t do that either.	tsy nanao izany koa ity iray ity
Men are men.	lehilahy no lehilahy
And yet, they are completely invisible and non -existent.	ary na dia izany aza dia tsy hita tanteraka sy tsy misy izany mihitsy izy ireo
The other is internal.	ny iray hafa dia anatiny
No one is happy to see him.	tsy misy faly mahita azy
I walk away and watch it.	mandeha lavitra aho ary mijery izany
But of course it won’t be like that.	saingy mazava ho azy fa tsy ho toy izany
One of these works well.	ny iray aminireo dia miasa tsara
One thing is very clear.	zavatra iray no tena mazava
That alone is true.	izany ihany no marina
No one is doing anything.	tsy misy manao na inona na inona
But it is very different.	tena hafa mihitsy anefa izany
At first everything went well.	taminny voalohany dia nandeha tsara ny zavadrehetra
They seem to be different people.	toa olona samy hafa izy ireo
I have to look a little crazy.	tsy maintsy mijery adala kely aho
With the same result.	miaraka aminny vokatra mitovy
So it is important for us.	noho izany dia zavadehibe ho antsika izany
However, at other times, as usual.	na izany aza aminny fotoana hafa toy ny mahazatra
It should no longer exist.	tsy tokony hisy intsony izany
It's the same.	mitovy ihany izany
It wasn't just there.	tsy teo fotsiny ilay izy
Everyone is just fun.	ny tsirairay dia mahafinaritra fotsiny
He seemed to have it.	toa nanana izany izy
In fact, it’s good for them.	raha ny marina tsara ho azy ireo
They are all happy.	faly izy rehetra
And she is beautiful, too.	ary tsara tarehy koa izy
I thought a lot.	nieritreritra be aho
No sense in looking.	tsy misy dikany mijery
I have to do it.	tokony hanao izany aho
He had to think of something.	tsy maintsy nieritreritra zavatra izy
That is, something more to more people.	izany hoe zavatra bebe kokoa aminny olona maro kokoa
And many more.	ary maro hafa
But not all of this is hard work.	tsy asa mafy daholo anefa izany
A man needs it.	mila anio ny lehilahy iray
See you tonight.	jereo anio alina
Now it all made sense.	ankehitriny dia nisy dikany daholo izany
However, there are also specials.	na izany aza misy ihany koa ny manokana
It was just a fun time for me.	fotoana nahafinaritra fotsiny izany ho ahy
I no longer know this man.	tsy fantatro intsony io lehilahy io
People looked at him.	nijery azy ny olona
They are not stupid.	tsy adala izy ireo
I just don’t like him.	tsy tiako fotsiny izy
What is missing here.	inona no tsy azo eto
No different tonight.	tsy misy hafa aminity alina ity
No one gets it right now.	tsy misy mahazo izany aminizao fotoana izao
They all work the same way.	izy rehetra dia miasa aminny fomba mitovy
Or well, really.	na tsara tena
If you don't know it.	raha tsy fantatrao izany
I need facts.	mila zavamisy aho
Sometimes it’s not.	indraindray dia tsy izany
But now they are dead.	fa izao dia maty izy ireo
Now, thanks for the food.	ankehitriny misaotra aminny sakafo
However, it can work well.	na izany aza dia afaka miasa tsara
It was a really big story.	tena tantara lehibe tokoa ilay izy
You are not meant for me.	tsy natao ho ahy ianao
The process may have already begun.	mety efa nanomboka aloha ny dingana
In the end, words are very important to me.	aminny farany tena zavadehibe amiko ny teny
But many of them do.	saingy maro aminizy ireo no manao izany
And yes, he did as he went.	ary eny nanao izany izy rehefa nandeha
We will never be the same again.	tsy ho olona mitovy intsony isika
I'm very tough.	mafy be aho
But we drove.	nandeha fiara anefa izahay
But in the end it’s very different.	saingy aminny farany dia tena tsy mitovy
Just love it.	tia azy fotsiny
There is nothing wrong with anything.	tsy misy diso na inona na inona
You probably know that.	fantatrao angamba izany
We have to do it really fast.	tsy maintsy manao izany haingana tokoa isika
Everyone did it.	samy nanao izany ny rehetra
But they don’t have that much.	saingy tsy manana izany betsaka izy ireo
It’s harder to say.	sarotra kokoa ny nilaza izany
Then there was the story of history.	avy eo dia nisy tantara momba ny tantara
But many do not.	maro anefa no tsy manao izany
He said he would do the same.	nilaza izy fa hanao toy izany koa
Then everything just stopped.	dia nijanona fotsiny ny zavadrehetra
That is not the case for me.	tsy izany no zavamisy amiko
There will be an end.	hisy ny farany
Yes, it makes sense.	eny misy dikany
If anything is worse.	raha misy zavatra ratsy kokoa
It’s not much, but something.	tsy dia be ilay izy fa zavatra
You just can’t do something like that.	tsy afaka manao zavatra toy izany fotsiny ianao
Too big for them.	lehibe loatra ho azy ireo
Although it is not certain.	na dia tsy azo antoka aza izany
The same is true of the real product.	toy izany koa ny tena vokatra
He lost what was important to him.	very izay zavadehibe taminy
We are life.	fiainana isika
Life is far more important than cars.	zavadehibe lavitra noho ny fiara ny fiainana
He doesn't know where he is now.	tsy fantany izay misy azy ankehitriny
I think that’s good sometimes.	heveriko fa tsara izany indraindray
Time is really for him.	ny fotoana dia tena noho izy
Or he may lose his job.	na mety ho very asa izy
You have really done so much for all of us.	tena nanao zavatra be dia be ho anay rehetra ianao
Such is the universe.	toy izany izao rehetra izao
I can be two things.	afaka ny ho zavatra roa aho
I've had enough.	efa saika ampy aho
And there will be.	ary hisy
He seems so much more than that.	toa mihoatra lavitra noho izany izy
They are all crazy.	adala daholo izy rehetra
They may be lost there.	mety ho very izy ireo any
Everything came to me.	tonga tamiko ny zavadrehetra
The process has to go.	tsy maintsy mandeha ny dingana tsy maintsy atao
Of course we need this game.	mazava ho azy fa mila ity lalao ity isika
She will be happy.	ho faly izy
It has to be a car.	tsy maintsy fiara ilay izy
They should do something about it.	tokony hanao zavatra momba izany izy ireo
This guy is a big part of it.	ity lehilahy ity dia ampahany lehibe
The days to come.	ny andro ho avy
This is just another kind of work.	karazana asa hafa ihany ity
Look down, see how.	mijery ambany mahita ny fomba
It can’t be that bad.	tsy mety ho ratsy izany
It was fun, but still not something that happened by chance.	nahafinaritra izany saingy mbola tsy zavatra tonga ho azy
He now had nothing.	tsy nanana na inona na inona izy izao
It all seemed to go well.	toa nandeha tsara daholo izany rehetra izany
So we had to say it right.	koa tsy maintsy nilaza tsara izahay
He will be himself.	izy dia ho ny tenany
You need to.	ianao dia mila
You are not real.	tsy tena ianao
You don't need it.	tsy mila azy
Everything should be fine.	tokony ho tsara daholo ny zavadrehetra
That’s what news is all about.	izany no atao hoe vaovao
Has been working well for me lately.	miasa tsara ho ahy vao haingana
Just once, and that’s enough.	indray mandeha ihany ary efa ampy izay
You shouldn’t be here unless it’s on one.	tsy tokony ho eto ianao raha tsy aminny iray
The same can be said of other foods.	mety ho toy izany koa ny sakafo hafa
Then it was all gone.	dia lasa daholo izany
He was the best in part.	izy no tsara indrindra taminny ampahany
I need you with me here.	mila anao miaraka amiko eto aho
But I came to love him.	lasa tia azy anefa aho
When they saw him.	rehefa nahita azy izy ireo
We had two difficult years.	nanana roa taona sarotra izahay
It doesn’t seem to be happening now.	toa tsy ho tanteraka izany ankehitriny
Both of them.	samy izy ireo
Maybe they won’t.	angamba tsy hanao izany izy ireo
And that seems to be the problem.	ary toa izay no olana
He was real.	tena nisy izy
Although not.	na dia tsy izany aza
And it’s really fun to do that.	ary tena mahafinaritra tokoa ny manao izany
We had such really crazy people.	nanana olona tena adala toy izany izahay
It wasn't even two o'clock.	mbola tsy taminny roa akory izany
I have to look away.	tsy maintsy mijery lavitra aho
Full ideas coming soon !.	hevitra feno ho avy tsy ho ela
Definitely get it.	azo antoka fa azo
So, it’s special.	noho izany manokana izany
But this is it.	fa izao no izy
That could be the top.	izany dia mety ho ny ambony
He will not make the same choice.	tsy hanao safidy mitovy aminizany koa izy
You won’t go wrong when you look at it.	tsy ho diso ianao rehefa mijery azy
Then it went well again.	dia nandeha tsara indray izany
We've been doing this for two years.	roa taona isika vao manao izany
Or go crazy with it.	na mandeha adala aminizany
Whether it’s everything or not to me.	na ny zavadrehetra izany na tsia amiko
We will all be lost.	ho very daholo isika rehetra
He loves to do it, you know.	tiany ny manao izany fantatrao
He really doesn’t need me.	tena tsy mila ahy izy
It is bad if we do that.	ratsy raha manao izany isika
But there is something else in it as well.	saingy misy zavatra hafa koa ao
As you know, he saw me.	araka ny fantatrao dia nahita ahy izy
I love the light.	tiako ny mazava
This is very bad in general.	tena ratsy izany aminny ankapobeny
It’s just a house that you’ll be free.	trano fotsiny io fa ho afaka ianao
This man is not good.	tsy tsara io lehilahy io
That seems like a big deal.	toa zavatra lehibe izany
No, no words.	tsia tsy misy teny
All years are good.	ny taona rehetra dia tsara
You can see them all below.	afaka mahita azy rehetra eto ambany ianao
There was none, not now, never will be.	tsy nisy tsy izao tsy hisy mihitsy
It won’t be a thousand steps.	tsy ho dingana iray alina izany
This is the time, you know.	izao no fotoana fantatrao
We will be able to do it easily.	ho afaka hanao izany mora izahay
Because it’s good, no matter what.	satria tsara izany na inona na inona
I was almost there.	saika teo aho
Maybe you don’t have that.	angamba tsy manana izany ianao
It was really fun for him.	tena nahafinaritra azy izany
And it doesn't come at night.	ary tsy tonga aminny alina
This place is too bad, even if we can.	ratsy loatra ity toerana ity na dia afaka ihany aza izahay
Probably a bad idea.	hevitra ratsy angamba
Both are possible.	samy mety
Still not right.	mbola tsy mety
And there I am.	ary misy ahy
The journey became easier and easier.	lasa mora sy mora ny dia
It used to be very simple.	tsotra be ilay izy taloha
But now you need another woman.	fa izao ianao mila vehivavy hafa
No one has it.	tsy misy olona manana izany
The food was delicious.	nahafinaritra ny sakafo
It should have done so.	tokony ho nanao izany
Yes, the trip did it again.	eny nanao izany indray ny dia
This is not entirely wrong.	tsy diso tanteraka izany
We should be better.	tokony ho tsara kokoa isika
The man was not very happy.	tsy dia faly loatra ilay lehilahy
But he was no more.	tsy tao intsony anefa izy
He didn’t like anything about her.	tsy tiany na inona na inona momba azy
Often everyone dies.	matetika ny olona rehetra dia maty
I know exactly where they are.	fantatro tsara ny misy azy ireo
But it’s really bad.	fa tena ratsy
Some found it meaningful.	ny sasany dia nahita fa misy dikany izany
We will still be here.	mbola ho eto ihany izahay
Some have more, some have less.	ny sasany manana bebe kokoa ny sasany manana kely
You are too good to be right.	tsara loatra ianao ka tsy ho marina
Some were fun, some not.	ny sasany nahafinaritra ny sasany tsy
We can do so much better than that.	afaka manao tsara lavitra noho izany isika
They spent the night.	nanao alina izy ireo
Men and women.	lehilahy sy vehivavy
He is very far away.	lavitra be izy
I've lost it all.	efa very daholo aho
People like you and me.	ny olona toa ahy sy ianao
You are always wrong.	ianao foana no diso
He has no home.	tsy manana trano izy
But you have to do something.	saingy tsy maintsy manao zavatra ianao
He had never done anything like this before.	mbola tsy nanao zavatra toy izao izy
The only problem is news.	ny vaovao ihany no olana
We are human beings first and foremost.	isika dia olona voalohany indrindra
It’s something else.	zavatra hafa indray izany
Then an idea came to him.	nisy hevitra tonga taminy avy eo
This is a new person.	olona vaovao ity
To be stupid.	ny ho adala
Maybe he's not here.	angamba tsy eto izy
Not that way.	tsy aminizany fomba izany
And he did come.	ary tonga tokoa izy
When you do, you will love it the most.	rehefa manao izany ianao dia ho tianao indrindra
It seems like work, now.	toa asa izany ankehitriny
But, it could also be too much.	saingy mety ho be loatra koa izany
Internal issues.	olana anatiny
I think you are the best.	heveriko fa ianao no tsara indrindra
Very real, very real.	tena tena izy tena misy tokoa
This place is also good for photo shoots.	ity toerana ity koa dia tsara ho anny sary sary
In fact, the worst may yet come.	raha ny marina mety mbola ho avy ny ratsy indrindra
The product works.	miasa ny vokatra
Others hope it goes well.	manantena ny hafa fa mandeha tsara
Everyone did the same.	nanao toy izany koa ny rehetra
But all of this is misleading.	fa izany rehetra izany dia diso hevitra
You can too.	ianao koa dia afaka
They never had enough.	tsy nanana ny ampy mihitsy izy ireo
It’s a wonderful place.	toerana mahafinaritra izany
But the car kept coming.	tonga hatrany anefa ilay fiara
But it’s not too fast.	tsy dia haingana loatra anefa izany
You have seen him personally.	efa nahita azy manokana ianao
No one told me anything.	tsy nisy nilaza tamiko na inona na inona
But nothing.	saingy tsy misy na inona na inona
His facts were not very true.	tsy tena marina ny zavamisy taminy
He is no more.	tsy hita intsony izy
I’m probably not very mean.	tsy dia misy dikany loatra angamba aho
Of course, there is something a little different than that.	mazava ho azy fa misy zavatra hafa kely noho izany
And did the hard work.	ary nanao izay sarotra
You are very alone.	tena irery ianao
Not too crowded.	tsy dia be olona loatra
However, we need them next time.	na izany aza dia mila azy ireo isika aminny manaraka
Because some of it seemed pointless.	satria toa tsy nisy dikany ny sasany taminizany
However, here’s the idea.	na izany aza eto ny hevitra
I'm not like that now.	tsy izany aho izao
The last two days have been tough.	mafy ny roa andro farany
Tonight? 	aminizao alina izao
I love choice in everything.	tiako ny safidy aminny zavatra rehetra
I think they are all.	heveriko fa izy rehetra
You are really dead.	tena maty tokoa ianao
We are all stupid.	samy adala daholo isika
He’s not the bad type.	tsy karazana ratsy izy
But in general, this is not bad.	saingy aminny ankapobeny dia tsy ratsy izany
In good times and bad.	aminny fotoana tsara sy ratsy
Not everyone does, you know.	tsy ny rehetra no manao izany fantatrao
To me, it’s always about time.	amiko dia anny fotoana foana izany
However, there are better reasons.	na izany aza misy antony tsara kokoa
In fact, there was.	raha ny marina dia nisy
And there are so many good things in life.	ary misy zavatra tsara be dia be eo aminny fiainana
So it’s a difficult picture.	noho izany dia sary sarotra
I had a way.	nanana fomba aho
I always see him.	hitako foana izy
But that’s good, because it means both of us.	tsara anefa izany satria isika roa no dikany
Then a new idea came up.	dia nisy hevitra vaovao tonga
It will be very difficult.	ho sarotra be izany
This picture will be small.	ity sary ity dia ho kely
It may have already come.	mety efa tonga izany
I'm crazy about you.	adala aminao aho
Simple, and very good.	tsotra ary tena tsara
That seems to be the norm.	toa izany no mahazatra
I saw the problem too.	nahita ilay olana koa aho
The picture is simple.	tsotra ny sary
Although it is more difficult to get.	na dia sarotra kokoa aza ny mahazo izany
This process is somewhat similar to the first.	ity dingana ity dia somary mitovy aminny voalohany
Life will be very difficult for us.	ho sarotra be ny fiainana ho antsika
That first step starts with me.	manomboka amiko izany dingana voalohany izany
But that requires more work.	mila asa bebe kokoa anefa izany
Or as they get.	na toy ny mahazo azy ireo
this is ours.	antsika ity
Or any other reason.	na antony hafa
He didn’t like that conversation.	tsy tiany io resaka io
I always found work.	nahita asa foana aho
But the problem is all old history now.	fa ny olana dia efa tantara taloha daholo izao
She loves him and he loves her too.	tia azy izy ary tia azy koa izy
Anyway, you went.	na izany aza nandeha ianao
It will not come.	tsy ho tonga izany
Maybe that's not right.	angamba tsy mety izany
And they went.	dia nandeha izy ireo
But it’s still more than the above.	saingy mbola mihoatra ny ambony
There was a bad idea.	nisy hevitra ratsy
There is simply no other way.	tsy misy fomba hafa fotsiny
It also seems impossible.	toa tsy azo atao koa izany
This is not always a bad thing.	tsy zavatra ratsy foana izany
He didn’t know that, and he didn’t know why.	tsy fantany izay ary tsy fantany ny antony
It’s one way, or another.	fomba iray izany na fomba hafa
The work went fast.	nandeha haingana ny asa
It is the closest to us.	io no akaiky indrindra antsika
You have to be superior.	tsy maintsy ho ambony ianao
They may not be true.	mety tsy marina izy ireo
He saw us there again.	nahita anay tany indray izy
He will be very alone.	tena ho irery izy
But even then, it’s not really true.	saingy na izany aza dia tsy tena marina
It all seems so much fun.	izany rehetra izany dia toa mahafinaritra be
It's the same for me.	mitovy aminny ahy ihany ilay izy
It’s just a matter of time.	resaka fotoana fotsiny io
But in fact, get it right.	fa raha ny zavamisy mahazo tena
I’ve always known this stuff.	efa fantatro foana io zavatra io
But he is good at it.	fa tsara izy aminizany
Of course they work.	mazava ho azy fa miasa izy ireo
It will take many years now.	mila taona maro izao
And people still come to it.	ary mbola tonga aminizany ny olona
Otherwise, we go the same way.	raha tsy izany dia mandeha aminny fomba mitovy isika
And then there’s nothing else out of it.	ary avy eo dia tsy misy zavatra hafa avy aminizany
They are the real thing.	izy ireo no tena izy
Now more than ever.	aminizao fotoana izao mihoatra noho ny taloha
This is called time and place.	izany no atao hoe fotoana sy toerana
Do it as time goes on, and soon you will have enough.	ataovy izany rehefa mandeha ny fotoana ary tsy ho ela dia ho ampy ianao
You are a beautiful woman.	vehivavy tsara tarehy ianao
But about him.	fa ny momba azy
Thanks a lot for watching.	misaotra betsaka nijery
closer, in fact.	akaiky kokoa raha ny marina
So, we will do it.	noho izany hanao izany isika
I will do it again.	mbola hanao izany indray aho
So, about these questions.	noho izany momba ireo fanontaniana ireo
You should be new here.	tokony ho vaovao eto ianao
This is not a very difficult task.	tsy tena asa sarotra izany
I want you to know me.	tiako ho fantatrao aho
You start a new life.	manomboka fiainana vaovao ianao
And there was plenty of food.	ary nisy sakafo be dia be
Everything else seems to be the same.	toa mitovy daholo ny zavatra hafa rehetra
It should, of course.	tokony mazava ho azy
The land is not mine.	tsy ahy ny tany
They are all exactly the same.	mitovy tanteraka izy rehetra
They have always done that.	efa nanao izany foana izy ireo
There was nothing else going on.	tsy nisy zavatra hafa nisy taminizany
Everything is fine there.	tsara daholo any
So it is here.	dia toy izany koa ny eto
Saika.	saika
And from then on, everything was lost.	ary nanomboka teo dia very ny zavadrehetra
It will all be very simple.	ho tsotra tokoa izany rehetra izany
That was a good time.	izay fotoana tsara
He needed money fast.	nila vola haingana izy
Of course they have to.	mazava ho azy fa tsy maintsy manao izany izy ireo
People love me.	olona tia ahy
He was unique.	tsy nisy toa azy mihitsy izy
But the food goes.	mandeha anefa ny sakafo
A lot, it seems.	be dia be toa
However, in general it may exist.	na izany aza aminny ankapobeny dia mety misy
They both don’t like me very much.	samy tsy tia ahy loatra izy roa
Not bad, just simple.	tsy ratsy tsotra fotsiny
Talk about doing that.	resaka manao izany
Now, you have the choice.	ankehitriny manana ny safidy ianao
Nice day.	andro mahafinaritra
And it can be for everyone.	ary mety ho anny rehetra izany
He is full of life.	feno fiainana izy
And he alone.	ary izy irery ihany
All bad things.	ny zavatra ratsy rehetra
Absolutely far away.	lavitra tanteraka
But they could be.	mety ho izy ireo anefa
Hard is the right word.	mafy no teny mety
But it’s more.	saingy bebe kokoa izany
Life will be better.	ho tsara kokoa ny fiainana
Going fast.	mandeha haingana
This is true for some.	marina izany ho anny sasany
That’s what it’s all about.	izay ny momba azy
Old problems.	olana taloha
But it was very difficult in those days.	tena mafy anefa izany taminizany andro izany
But we were good.	saingy tsara izany izahay
I had a job.	nanana asa iray aho
Although something was missing.	na dia nisy zavatra tsy ampy aza
We are not happy with him.	tsy faly aminy izahay
But they’re not very fun.	saingy tsy dia mahafinaritra loatra izy ireo
It made sense to me.	nisy dikany tamiko izany
We are these men.	isika ireo lehilahy ireo
If you don’t, you really should.	raha tsy manao izany ianao dia tena tokony
They really have to do it.	tena tsy maintsy manao izany izy ireo
This will be easy to find.	io no ho mora hita
The house was not too big for them.	tsy dia lehibe loatra ho azy ireo ilay trano
However, there may be more to the story.	na izany aza mety mbola hisy bebe kokoa ny tantara
There could have been, of course.	mety nisy mazava ho azy
But here's what's wrong.	fa eto no tsy mety
He also knew he knew it.	fantany koa fa fantany izany
At first, he didn't see anything.	tsy nahita na inona na inona izy taminny voalohany
The war is far away.	lavitra ny ady
One of these things.	ny iray aminireo zavatra ireo
But that shouldn’t be a problem.	tsy tokony ho olana anefa izany
He is in it.	izy no eo aminy
But he had good reason.	nanana antony tsara anefa izy
I thought about it in two ways.	nieritreritra izany aho taminny fomba roa
But there it is, it has to be that way.	saingy misy izany tsy maintsy ho toy izany
And it could be two or three days.	ary mety ho roa na telo andro
The dead did not do that.	tsy nanao izany ny olona maty
I really like the people here.	tena tia ny olona eto aho
Not really, he said.	tsy tena hoy izy
Very handsome man.	tena lehilahy tsara tarehy
Both aren’t much.	samy tsy misy betsaka
The other one here.	ny iray hafa eto
They are common ideas.	hevitra mahazatra izy ireo
But he has gone too far.	efa lasa lavitra loatra anefa izy
As always, there is a lot of news.	toy ny mahazatra dia betsaka ny vaovao
This game is tough.	mafy ity lalao ity
I know, and it doesn’t make sense.	fantatro ary tsy misy dikany izany
I won't go far now.	tsy ho lasa lavitra aho izao
Good and enough.	tsara ary ampy izany
So no problem.	noho izany dia tsy misy olana
Everyone is doing good things.	samy manao zavatra tsara ny tsirairay
It's a tough fight than the last.	ady mafy kokoa noho ny taminny farany io
They needed a man.	nila lehilahy izy ireo
This is a clear day, so.	andro mazava izao ka
But it's all good.	tsara daholo anefa izany
But it was a lot of fun.	nahafinaritra be anefa ilay izy
This is important for some things.	zavadehibe aminny zavatra sasany izany
I know you will do a good job of it.	fantatro fa hanao asa tsara ianao aminizany
It was kind of a time for me.	izany dia karazana fotoana ho ahy
Many working women do it because they have to.	vehivavy maro miasa no manao izany satria tsy maintsy manao izany
Just a little fun.	mahafinaritra kely fotsiny
They seemed to have fun.	toa nahafinaritra azy ireo
This is the truth.	ity ny marina
It went a lot, like last night.	nandeha be toy ny alina
I really didn’t see it.	tena tsy hitako ilay izy
It may not be a good thing, for sure.	tsy mety ho zavatra tsara izany azo antoka izany
Either way it’s fun.	na izany na tsy izany dia mahafinaritra
I am no more.	tsy misy ahy intsony
Many people will do that.	olona maro no hanao izany
But they were all there.	teo anefa izy rehetra
Such a small moment.	fotoana kely toy izany
He recently died.	tsy ela akory izay dia maty izy
They all enjoyed it.	nahafinaritra azy rehetra izy ireo
They will do it again.	hanao izany indray izy ireo
But it can’t be both.	saingy tsy mety ho izy roa mihitsy
That, however, is all that.	izany na izany aza izany rehetra izany
It really seems too good to be true.	tena toa tsara loatra ny tena marina
Because he said.	satria hoy izy
We are having a good time.	manao fotoana tsara izahay
These are really fun.	tena mahafinaritra tokoa ireo
These are very difficult days.	tena andro sarotra tokoa ireo
They all looked at me.	nijery ahy daholo izy ireo
And so it is, well understood.	ary dia izany no izy azo tsara
And now, he is gone.	ary izao lasa izy
He said he would be there.	nilaza izy fa ho any
In fact, she doesn’t seem very pretty.	raha ny marina toa tsy dia tsara tarehy loatra izy
What matters is the next day.	ny zavadehibe dia ny andro manaraka
And one hopes they will.	ary ny iray dia manantena fa hanao izany izy ireo
It's really for you.	ho anao tokoa izany
He looked around, confused.	nijery manodidina izy very hevitra
Good job.	asa tsara
One of the best words.	teny iray aminny tsara indrindra
It’s good to start now, today.	tsara ny manomboka izao anio
But she is a great woman.	saingy vehivavy lehibe izy
In fact, there seemed to be nothing.	raha ny marina toa tsy nisy na inona na inona
This is a common fact.	zavamisy mahazatra izany
Many of them are already working.	efa maro aminizy ireo no efa miasa
They are not pretty.	tsy tsara tarehy izy ireo
Yes, good words can be bad.	eny mety tsy tsara ny teny tsara
There is simply none.	tsy misy ihany
He saw a lot of life.	nahita fiainana be dia be izy
So, the work was done.	noho izany ny asa dia natao
He didn't need to tell me that.	tsy nila nilaza izany tamiko izy
He did, well.	nanao izany izy tsara
This location is unsafe.	tsy azo antoka io toerana io
It’s like a story in history.	toy ny tantara ao aminny tantara izy io
Or maybe it’s not possible.	na angamba tsy azo atao izany
They may also be more feminine.	mety ho vehivavy kokoa koa izy ireo
Because games are often.	satria matetika ny lalao
You are the only one working on it.	ianao irery no miasa aminizany
We do that with everything.	manao izany izahay aminny zavadrehetra
A question, he thought.	fanontaniana iray hoy izy nieritreritra
That’s a whole other kind of question.	karazana fanontaniana hafa mihitsy izany
So he has to get them some other way.	noho izany dia tsy maintsy mahazo azy ireo aminny fomba hafa izy
I can't watch these.	tsy afaka mijery ireo aho
He doesn’t need that kind of story.	tsy mila izany karazana tantara izany izy
But more importantly, it’s the truth.	fa ny tena zavadehibe dia ny marina
And the place.	ary ny toerana
In fact, he can no longer.	raha ny marina dia tsy afaka intsony izy
So for me, that’s really important.	ka ho ahy dia tena zavadehibe izany
It’s a worthwhile job.	asa mendrika izany
It went well sometimes but not always.	nandeha tsara izany indraindray fa tsy foana
No one is here.	tsy misy olona eto
All the dead will come.	ho avy ny maty rehetra
This is one of my favorites.	ity no iray aminireo tiako indrindra
I was finally able to see him again.	afaka nahita azy indray aho taminny farany
You can't be here.	tsy afaka eto ianao
Not with.	tsy miaraka aminny
It is a difficult process.	dingana sarotra izany
That's probably it.	izay angamba izany
The idea is almost always good.	saika tsara foana ny hevitra
Look at all the men here.	jereo ny lehilahy rehetra eto
You said that too.	nilaza izany koa ianao
I should be more honest.	tokony ho marina kokoa aho
And it’s a lot of work.	ary tena asa be izany
Even a little.	na ny kely aza
You have grown up.	efa lehibe ianao
We have women who need to see you.	manana vehivavy mila mahita anao izahay
Eventually he died.	farany dia maty izy
But he still does it over and over again.	mbola manao izany hatrany hatrany anefa izy
It can be a really fun story.	mety ho tantara mahafinaritra tokoa izany
The story is good.	tsara ny tantara
But the previous idea should always be.	fa ny hevitra teo aloha dia tokony ho foana
You are unique.	tsy misy toa azy ianao
But nothing big.	tsy misy lehibe anefa
Anyway, he's still there.	na izany na tsy izany mbola eo izy
But of course that question will be different.	saingy mazava ho azy fa ho hafa io fanontaniana io
Not just one species but one of a kind.	tsy ny karazana ihany fa ny iray aminireo karazana
I don’t want to lose it.	tsy te ho very izany aho
I could no longer do that.	tsy afaka nanao izany intsony aho
Of course they can't.	mazava ho azy fa tsy afaka izy ireo
He is not ugly.	tsy ratsy tarehy izy
Maybe you should do the same.	angamba tokony hanao toy izany koa ianao
Going or not working.	mandeha na tsy miasa
Which is true, very true.	izay marina tena marina
But he was not just a man.	tsy lehilahy fotsiny anefa izy
This little house was really nice.	nahafinaritra tokoa ity trano kely ity
I think he enjoyed it.	heveriko fa nahafinaritra azy izany
I have no land.	tsy manana tany aho
It is not suitable for food at all.	tsy mety aminny sakafo mihitsy izany
And the next one is really fun.	ary ny manaraka dia tena mahafinaritra
And that’s really important.	ary tena zavadehibe tokoa izany
We have the same in conversation.	manana toy izany koa isika aminny resaka
There will be no life below for them.	tsy hisy fiainana any ambany ho azy ireo
Good time, good time.	fotoana tsara fotoana tsara
Maybe he already knew that.	angamba efa fantany foana izany
Very good idea too.	hevitra tena tsara koa
Didn't do anything.	tsy nanao na inona na inona
There was nothing free.	tsy nisy na inona na inona afaka
He wants you to be happy like him.	tiany ho faly toa azy ianao
It looks like you lost yours.	toa very ny anao
I don't look at him.	tsy mijery azy aho
That sounds good to him.	toa tsara ho azy izany
So everything will be fine in the end.	noho izany dia ho tsara daholo ny zavadrehetra aminny farany
He can do many things now.	afaka manao zavatra maro izy izao
They are still alone.	mbola irery izy ireo
People just walked the old way.	nandeha lalana taloha fotsiny ny olona
You don’t want to be around him.	tsy te ho manodidina azy ianao
Many don’t get us.	maro no tsy mahazo antsika
That is the most beautiful.	izay no tsara tarehy indrindra
But he is never alone.	fa tsy irery mihitsy
Not all, of course.	tsy ny rehetra mazava ho azy
Maybe he will be gone.	angamba ho lasa izy
It really doesn’t suit me.	tena tsy mety amiko izany
Nothing is enough.	tsy ampy na inona na inona
Certainly not what it is.	azo antoka fa tsy inona izany
But he also seems like a good -looking man.	saingy toa lehilahy tsara tarehy tsara ihany koa
Indeed, it would be very true.	eny tokoa ho tena marina tokoa izany
One day maybe more.	indray andro any angamba bebe kokoa
The action is not very fast.	tsy dia haingana loatra ny hetsika
One day he said he didn’t.	indray andro dia nilaza izy fa tsy nanao izany
And we draw.	ary manao sary izahay
It also doesn’t work.	tsy miasa koa izany
Unless you are a woman.	raha tsy hoe vehivavy ianao
Not that it went too fast.	tsy hoe nandeha haingana be izany
Wrong, of course.	diso mazava ho azy
In the following question.	aminizao fanontaniana manaraka izao
It seemed very difficult.	toa sarotra be ilay izy
In fact, you may be just like before.	raha ny marina mety ho toy ny taloha ihany koa ianao
It was a time for me.	fotoana iray ho ahy izany
Yes, not all the time.	eny tsy aminny fotoana rehetra
I had that good idea.	nanana izany hevitra tsara izany aho
The story is complex and interesting.	sarotra sy mahafinaritra ny tantara
You have time.	manana fotoana ianao
He didn't need to look at them.	tsy nila nijery azy ireo izy
They don’t like work.	tsy tia asa izy ireo
No, everything is completely different.	tsia hafa mihitsy ny zavadrehetra
So, the more words, the better.	noho izany bebe kokoa ny teny ny tsara kokoa
He’s not too hard.	tsy dia mafy loatra izy
Not the road, the ground.	tsy ny lalana ny tany
If this is not enough, there are other problems as well.	raha tsy ampy izany dia misy olana hafa koa
And that’s far worse.	ary ratsy lavitra izany
I think that's it.	heveriko fa izany ihany
And a lot of good things come out of it.	ary betsaka ny zavatra tsara azo avy aminizany
The time has come and we can do it.	tonga ny fotoana ary afaka manao izany isika
Don’t get me wrong.	aza diso hevitra aho
There is nothing now.	tsy misy na inona na inona izao
Well not really a question.	eny fa tsy tena fanontaniana
We need a house.	mila trano izahay
Nice picture, actually.	sary mahafinaritra raha ny marina
He thought about the past and the present.	nieritreritra ny lasa sy ny ankehitriny izy
Went in three steps.	nandeha taminny dingana telo
But not everyone seems to be.	tsy araka ny hita anefa ny rehetra
The idea is clear.	mazava ny hevitra
They are now.	izy ireo aminizao fotoana izao
At the time, it certainly wasn’t.	taminizany fotoana izany dia azo antoka fa tsy izany
He does things and does them well.	manao zavatra izy ary manao izany tsara
They seem to work with some people.	toa miasa aminny olona sasany izy ireo
But, actually, that’s not a problem.	saingy raha ny marina tsy olana izany
But I really like them.	tena tiako anefa izy ireo
It's not right for them.	tsy mety aminizy ireo mihitsy izany
I am also very close to him.	tena akaiky azy koa aho
It's not safe here.	tsy azo antoka ny eto
We have been there for a long time.	efa ela izahay no tany
Not at all.	tsy aminizy rehetra
He didn't even see it.	tsy nahita akory izy
It was as if he was far away.	toy ny hoe lavitra izy
No one else was around.	tsy nisy olona hafa teny aminny manodidina
Had them before.	nanana azy ireo taloha
He will have to know in the end.	tsy maintsy ho fantany aminny farany
Do it with him.	ataovy miaraka aminy izany
He is not like us.	tsy toa antsika izy
I won't even be there.	tsy ho any akory aho
Go early.	lasa aloha
I will be really happy.	tena ho faly aho
I can't, soon.	tsy afaka aho tsy ela
Surely he could have seen it.	azo antoka fa afaka nahita izany izy
But it had to be done.	tsy maintsy natao anefa izany
The fact is, he didn’t.	ny zavamisy dia tsy nanao izany izy
It just started, you know.	vao nanomboka izany fantatrao
It can go crazy.	mety ho lasa adala
And when you do, others will do the same.	ary rehefa manao izany ianao dia hanao toy izany koa ny hafa
I die inside.	maty aho ao anatiny
I hope you enjoyed it !.	manantena aho fa nahafinaritra anao
They went too fast.	nandeha haingana loatra izy ireo
They got nothing for him.	tsy nahazo na inona na inona ho azy izy ireo
The same is true of other evils.	toy izany koa ny ratsy hafa
Just like now.	toy ny ankehitriny ihany
We will definitely do another one soon.	azo antoka fa hanao iray hafa tsy ho ela isika
So thank you.	koa misaotra anao
You can do a little or a lot.	afaka manao kely na betsaka ianao
You looked at him like that.	nijery azy toy izany ianao
It was a great game.	lalao lehibe tokoa izy io
It was all made for him.	izany rehetra izany dia natao ho azy
Either way, it’s no longer there.	na izany na tsy izany dia tsy misy intsony izany
We had a choice to make.	nanana safidy natao izahay
Soon.	tsy ho ela ihany
But he doesn’t know everything.	saingy tsy fantany ny zavadrehetra
But nothing came of it.	tsy nisy na inona na inona tonga taminizany anefa
Sometimes both work.	indraindray samy mety
They are the best right now.	izy ireo no tsara indrindra aminizao fotoana izao
There are other women.	misy vehivavy hafa
In fact, it looks far away.	raha ny marina dia mijery lavitra
It can be done.	azo natao izany
Then came the question.	dia tonga ny fanontaniana
And you really will.	ary tena hanao izany ianao
None at all.	tsy misy mihitsy
It will always be there.	ho eo foana izany
You know the story.	fantatrao ny tantara
He can do whatever he wants.	mety hanao izay tiany izy
Often, though, things do not go well.	matetika anefa no tsy mandeha tsara
About anything that is possible.	momba ny zavatra rehetra azo atao
You have to go at the right time.	tsy maintsy mandeha aminny fotoana mety ianao
Some of them are new and challenging.	ny sasany aminizy ireo dia vaovao ary sarotra
Maybe never.	angamba tsy hisy mihitsy
Not someone like me.	tsy olona toa ahy
Then it stopped one day, like that.	dia nijanona indray andro toy izany
Many games do that.	lalao maro no manao izany
Or maybe he just liked her.	na angamba tiany fotsiny izy
You, too, are not like that.	ianao koa tsy toy izany
Never look at him.	aza mijery azy mihitsy
The location is very hard to find, however.	ny toerana dia tena sarotra hita na izany aza
You need to be right with me.	mila marina tsara amiko ianao
This idea is very important.	zavadehibe tokoa io hevitra io
But it has to be done.	fa tsy maintsy ho tanteraka
But things are not so simple.	saingy tsy dia tsotra ny zavatra
It must have been like many years for them.	tsy maintsy ho toy ny taona maro ho azy ireo izany
Someone is dead inside.	misy olona maty ao anatiny
This is often true.	marina izany matetika
He was really fun.	nahafinaritra tokoa izy
That, as it turns out, is a good thing.	izany araka ny hita dia zavatra tsara
Not here in particular.	tsy eto manokana
And that’s really crazy.	dia tena adala tokoa izany
If it’s too hard, start small.	raha toa ka sarotra loatra izany dia manomboka kely
From the ground.	avy aminny tany
Money and this house.	ny vola sy ity trano ity
Sure there was.	azo antoka fa nisy
There is a lot of truth in the story.	betsaka ny marina aminny tantara
I have people working on it.	manana olona miasa aminizany aho

It was all very new to him.	tena vaovao aminy daholo izany
Sometimes crowded.	feno olona indraindray
Otherwise, you can no longer walk.	raha tsy izany dia tsy afaka mandeha intsony ianao
To me, this is very important.	amiko dia tena ilaina izany

Not all women are like that.	tsy ny vehivavy rehetra no toy izany

He seemed to have the best part, in fact.	toa nanana ny ampahany tsara indrindra izy raha ny marina
Someone is wrong.	olona iray no diso

The story may be true even if it is not true.	mety ho marina ny tantara na dia tsy tena izy aza

They told him that was it.	nilaza taminy izy ireo fa izany no izy
This is the new part.	izany no ampahany vaovao

It can do a lot of things.	afaka manao zavatra betsaka izy io
But to me it’s more than that.	fa amiko dia mihoatra noho izany
There it is again.	ao indray izany
And we’re glad we don’t have that often right now.	ary faly izahay fa tsy manana izany matetika aminizao fotoana izao
Do them well.	ataovy tsara izy ireo
I think every game is different.	heveriko fa samy hafa ny lalao rehetra
Right now, we don’t have that.	aminizao fotoana izao tsy manana izany isika
These are the only facts.	ireo ihany no zavamisy
He just needs you.	mila anao fotsiny izy
This is new.	vaovao ity
This is important.	zavadehibe io
I always see people die.	mahita olona maty foana aho
There is no way it is wrong.	tsy misy fomba tsy izy
In fact, he didn’t have it.	raha ny marina tsy nanana izany izy
It doesn't work otherwise.	tsy miasa raha tsy izany
This place, though.	ity toerana ity na dia
You have a special problem.	manana olana manokana ianao
These are the important ones.	ireo no zavadehibe
So, we’re a little bit here right now.	noho izany somary eto ihany isika aminizao fotoana izao
The time, place and the dead need to be clear.	mila mazava tsara ny fotoana sy ny toerana ary ny maty
He knew he was there.	fantany fa teo izy
But this game is different.	hafa anefa io lalao io
But you already know that.	efa fantatrao anefa izany
But they are still about me.	saingy mbola momba ahy ihany izy ireo
It remains to be seen.	mbola ho hita izany
He looked around better.	nijery tsara kokoa ny manodidina izy
He really knew that.	fantany tokoa izany
That’s all stupid.	izany no adala rehetra
They all started life again.	nanomboka ny fiainana indray izy rehetra
And it keeps coming.	ary tonga hatrany
There is nothing unusual here.	tsy misy zavatra tsy mahazatra eto
They had no choice now.	tsy nanana safidy izy ireo ankehitriny
And money, of course.	ary ny vola mazava ho azy
But some are good.	fa ny sasany tsara
He thought more.	nieritreritra bebe kokoa izy
In the news perhaps.	aminny vaovao angamba
If anyone sees it, they might know.	raha misy mahita azy dia mety ho fantany
We are all here too.	isika rehetra eto koa
He is no longer around.	tsy eo aminny manodidina intsony izy
This process is important.	zavadehibe io dingana io
They didn’t go far in general.	tsy nandeha lavitra izy ireo taminny ankapobeny
Maybe the word works.	angamba ny teny miasa
Then it works.	dia miasa izany
They did and it was really bad.	nanao izy ireo ary tena ratsy
Everything is fine and together.	tsara ny zavadrehetra ary miaraka
Look as closely as possible.	jereo akaiky araka izay azo atao
There may be something you can do about it.	mety misy zavatra azonao atao momba izany
Nothing simply.	tsy misy tsotra izao
But it will happen.	saingy ho tanteraka izany
He was not there either.	tsy teo koa izy
I'm really confused here.	tena very hevitra aho eto
Both get them.	samy mahazo azy ireo
It’s all really his.	tena azy daholo izany
Some are good.	ny sasany tsara
I don’t deserve it, of course.	tsy mendrika izany aho mazava ho azy
But he had his own choices.	saingy nanana safidy manokana izy
However, he could not stay without her.	na izany aza tsy afaka nijanona tsy nila azy izy
More than life.	mihoatra noho ny fiainana
But that's enough.	fa ampy izao
She has to make me a real woman too.	tsy maintsy manao vehivavy marina amiko koa izy
But it wasn’t much fun.	saingy tsy dia nahafinaritra
I didn’t say anything about him.	tsy nilaza na inona na inona momba azy aho
It really made sense.	nisy dikany tokoa izany
He did not get there.	tsy tonga teo izy
And yes, it’s a choice.	ary eny safidy izany
But the reason came.	saingy tonga ny antony
Every word, he said.	ny teny tsirairay hoy izy
And sometimes it doesn’t.	ary indraindray tsy mety
You don't understand it very well.	tsy azonao tsara izany
Often no one is there.	matetika tsy misy olona ao
He is the universe.	izy no izao rehetra izao
He was the best of it.	izy no tsara indrindra taminizany
This is not ours.	tsy antsika ity
They have no information.	tsy manana vaovao izy ireo
Every game, just bad.	ny lalao rehetra ratsy fotsiny
This may be for the following reasons.	mety ho noho ny antony manaraka izany
But the truth is the truth.	fa ny marina no marina
We have come a long way since then.	efa lasa lavitra isika nanomboka teo
I saw something too.	nahita zavatra koa aho
Thank you for being clear.	misaotra anao nilaza ny mazava
You deserve people like him.	mendrika ny olona toa azy ianao
I still need to watch them.	mbola mila mijery azy ireo aho
I am very close to them now.	tena akaiky azy ireo aho izao
To be there.	mba ho eo izy
Then one day passed.	dia lasa indray andro
But he is still here.	saingy mbola eto izy
You don’t look at these things.	tsy mijery ireo zavatra ireo ianao
But nothing was immediately available.	saingy tsy nisy azo avy hatrany
In fact, it is ours.	raha ny marina dia antsika izany
More appropriate.	mety kokoa
Too good, really.	tsara loatra tena
We looked at you.	nijery anao izahay
And he really loves me.	ary tena tiany aho
Everything is pretty good.	somary tsara ny zavadrehetra
If you are far away.	raha lavitra ianao
That is the main reason.	izany no antony lehibe indrindra
They both look at me.	samy mijery ahy izy roa
This was difficult for him at times.	sarotra taminy izany indraindray
If it goes as it should.	raha mandeha aminny tokony ho
He and they.	izy sy izy ireo
Every game is different.	samy hafa ny lalao tsirairay
Everything seemed to go smoothly and simply.	toa nandeha mora sy tsotra ny zavadrehetra
He said he didn’t like it.	nilaza izy fa tsy tiany izany
He has been there for a long time.	efa ela izy no tao
This man has been dead for too long.	efa ela loatra ity lehilahy ity no maty
Then came the question again.	dia tonga indray ny fanontaniana
Not very good for me.	tsy dia tsara loatra amiko
There was nothing wrong with the face.	tsy nisy diso ny tarehy
It could be more beautiful.	mety ho tsara tarehy kokoa
Make sure they are good.	ataovy azo antoka fa tsara izy ireo
I like it right away.	tiako izany avy hatrany
There is no talk of me and you.	tsy misy resaka momba ahy sy ianao
The reason is this.	ny antony dia izao
And yet, look at the results.	ary na izany aza jereo ny vokatra
They are both very difficult.	samy sarotra be izy ireo
Which may be true.	izay mety ho marina
But he did not want to do that to her.	tsy te hanao izany taminy anefa izy
There seemed to be a good reason for them.	toa nisy antony tsara ho azy ireo
And in fact, that night was unusual.	ary raha ny marina tsy mahazatra io alina io
That is now.	izany dia aminizao fotoana izao
There’s a lot to do here.	betsaka ny manao izany eto
It will always be that way, he said.	ho toy izany foana izany hoy izy
There is nothing in the world.	tsy misy na inona na inona eto aminizao tontolo izao
You are no different.	tsy hafa mihitsy ianao
You said something similar.	nilaza zavatra mitovy aminizany ianao
They are very meaningful.	tena misy dikany izy ireo
He knows that part.	fantany io ampahany io
Arrive early too.	tonga aloha koa
They are all yours.	anao daholo izy ireo
Not always, of course.	tsy foana mazava ho azy
Surely you know that.	azo antoka fa fantatrao izany
But he may have an idea.	mety manana hevitra anefa izy
But don't go alone.	fa aza mandeha irery
Something is missing from me.	misy zavatra tsy ampy ahy
We need facts.	mila zavamisy isika
But this problem went away on its own.	saingy nandeha ho azy io olana io
You can be the same.	mety ho toy izany koa ianao
Probably many of them.	angamba maro aminizy ireo
We are happy about that.	faly izahay noho izany
But it’s fun to watch.	mahafinaritra anefa ny mijery
It works for you.	miasa aminao
This is the most insignificant part.	ity no ampahany tsy misy dikany indrindra
It was not easy to walk and walk.	tsy mora ny nandeha sy nandeha
And of course everything goes.	ary mazava ho azy fa mandeha ny zavadrehetra
Yes, he was fun.	eny nahafinaritra izy
Yes it must be.	eny tsy maintsy izay
In the world.	aminizao tontolo izao
This is the obvious part.	ity no ampahany mazava
Not everyone who wants to come here can.	tsy izay rehetra te ho tonga eto no afaka
However, there is a story.	na izany aza dia misy tantara
He stopped and looked at it.	nijanona izy ary nijery izany
There may be another day.	mety hisy andro hafa
It’s not just a nightmare.	tsy alina alina fotsiny izany
I don’t want this life for him.	tsy tiako ho azy ity fiainana ity
They were minors at the time.	tsy ampy taona izy ireo taminizany
Keep me close.	ataovy akaiky aho
The following is a must for him.	ity manaraka ity dia tsy maintsy ho azy
He will be for us.	izy no ho antsika
So we are with the world.	koa miaraka aminizao tontolo izao isika
And he always is.	ary izy foana
So we get nothing.	ka tsy mahazo na inona na inona izahay
There is no special place anymore.	tsy misy toerana manokana intsony
But we need it.	mila izany anefa isika
Really completely lost.	tena very tanteraka
But not for me.	tsy ho ahy anefa
Now that will be history.	ankehitriny dia ho tantara izany
These are generally true.	aminny ankapobeny dia marina ireo aminny ankapobeny
Those days are gone.	lasa ireo andro ireo
He will not be of age.	tsy ho ampy taona izy
I don’t like him at all.	tsy tia azy aho na inona na inona
I hope you like these because they are still to come !.	manantena aho fa tianao ireo satria mbola ho avy
So, the two of them are now the same no matter what.	noho izany izy roa ireo izao dia mitovy aminy na inona
Yes, they could have gotten me easily.	eny afaka nahazo ahy mora foana izy ireo
But those sometimes really get to me.	saingy ireo indraindray dia tena mahazo ahy
This game seems easy at first, it really does.	toa mora ity lalao ity aminny voalohany tena manao izany
Glad you saw us too.	faly ianao nahita anay koa
And we are not alone.	ary tsy isika ihany
Some lost their jobs.	nisy very asa
The words are beautiful.	mahafinaritra ny teny
I know you know me.	fantatro fa fantatrao aho
It may be the same, but not the same.	mety mitovy fa tsy mitovy
Really confused.	very hevitra tokoa
But, first things first.	saingy ny zavatra voalohany aloha
In fact, it could be crazy.	raha ny marina dia mety ho adala izany
But nothing was found.	tsy nisy hita anefa
I have no particular problem with you.	tsy manana olana manokana aminao aho
But in fact, he did not say why.	saingy raha ny marina dia tsy nilaza ny antony izy
But it’s not here or it’s not here right now.	saingy tsy eto na tsy eto aminizao fotoana izao
Another good product.	vokatra tsara iray hafa
I have a particular problem with many of them.	manana olana manokana aminny maro aminizy ireo aho
Everything is the old way.	ny zavadrehetra dia aminny fomba taloha
I see a little space for ideas here.	mahita toerana kely ho anny hevitra aho eto
Nothing else is really necessary.	tsy misy zavatra hafa tena ilaina mihitsy
Sometimes the same day.	indraindray ny andro iray ihany
We follow him closely.	manaraka azy akaiky izahay
Full time next.	fotoana feno ny manaraka
You had to do a lot of work on it.	tsy maintsy nanao asa betsaka taminizany ianao
He didn’t mean much.	tsy dia nisy dikany loatra izy
Hope you like it.	manantena ianao fa tianao
But to me there is no question.	fa amiko dia tsy misy fanontaniana
And, yes, they did.	ary eny nanao izany izy ireo
Yes, there were three.	eny nisy telo
It was endless fun for him.	nahafinaritra azy tsy nisy farany izany
The house is where I am.	eo aminny toerana misy ahy ny trano
Well, it didn’t go that way.	eny tsy nandeha taminizany fomba izany
The other way has gone too far.	lasa lavitra loatra ny lalana hafa
He doesn't seem very happy.	toa tsy faly be izy
The car is designed for the hard.	ny fiara dia natao ho anny mafy
Yes, yes, they seem to be.	eny eny toa izy ireo
There are many other options.	betsaka ny safidy hafa
This may be especially true when it comes to money.	mety ho marina izany indrindra raha resaka vola
I did, but not anymore.	nanao aho saingy tsy izany intsony
But they had to take the first step.	tsy maintsy nanao ny dingana voalohany anefa izy ireo
It is a very difficult task.	asa sarotra be izany
I know him well.	fantatro tsara izy
You can have two, but you can’t have three.	afaka manana roa ianao fa tsy afaka manana ny telo
I don't want to come too soon.	tsy te ho tonga haingana aho
And you can do it.	ary azonao atao izany
We can’t make one for him.	tsy afaka manao iray ho azy izahay
For the same thing.	ho anny zavatra iray ihany
And selfish, too.	ary tia tena koa
He cannot be more than three years old.	tsy afaka mihoatra ny telo taona izy
It is the same.	izy io dia iray ihany
To them, history is more important.	aminizy ireo dia zavadehibe kokoa ny tantara
None of it was fun.	tsy nisy nahafinaritra izany
I really didn’t think of that.	tena tsy nieritreritra ahy izany
Everyone can see it.	afaka mahita izany ny rehetra
And that’s really good.	ary tena tsara tokoa izany
Or there are two people in it.	na misy olona roa ao anatiny
There are two ways, but not one.	misy fomba roa fa tsy iray
Nothing to see here.	tsy misy zavatra hita eto
There is nothing to do here.	tsy misy zavatra tsy maintsy atao eto
We were not there.	tsy nisy izahay
All these people.	ireo olona rehetra ireo
Maybe that’s not true.	angamba tsy misy marina izany
I have to look my best.	tsy maintsy mijery ny tsara indrindra aho
As you can be sure of anything.	araka izay azonao antoka na inona na inona
It’s all lost.	very izany ny rehetra
He can’t, and probably won’t be.	tsy afaka izy ary mety tsy ho toy izany intsony
Not good for him either.	tsy tsara ho azy koa
It was so beautiful that things came easily to her.	tsara tarehy tokoa ka tonga mora taminy ny zavatra
It has two main parts.	misy ampahany roa lehibe izy io
Lots of good choices.	safidy tsara be dia be
I know the fight is hard.	fantatro fa sarotra ny ady
I have never done that before.	mbola tsy nanao izany mihitsy aho
The problem is it doesn’t work.	ny olana dia tsy miasa
I only know why.	fantatro ihany ny antony
I’m so glad he did.	faly be aho fa nanao izany izy
It is in you.	misy ao aminao izany
He now knows what is wrong.	fantany izao ny tsy mety
In fact, nothing is certain.	raha ny marina dia tsy misy azo antoka
One common problem is this.	ny olana iray aminny ankapobeny dia ity
But they can be harder.	mety ho mafy kokoa anefa izy ireo
The past is always there.	ny lasa dia misy foana
But I couldn’t get them.	saingy tsy afaka nahazo azy ireo
It was never meant to be that way, of course.	tsy natao ho toy izany mihitsy mazava ho azy
And it still works.	ary mbola miasa izany
And he is good.	ary tsara izy
In fact, right now, it doesn’t make sense.	raha ny marina aminizao fotoana izao dia tsy misy dikany izany
I had never seen them before.	mbola tsy nahita azy ireo aho taloha
And worth the news.	ary mendrika ny vaovao
They are always there, always going, always working.	eo foana izy ireo mandeha foana miasa foana
They are all very good people.	olona tena tsara daholo
In fact, it’s really bad.	raha ny marina dia tena ratsy izany
And you have to know that.	ary tsy maintsy fantatrao izany
It’s a typical meal.	sakafo mahazatra izany
There should be more.	tokony hisy bebe kokoa
Or not alone.	na tsy irery
So you said.	ka hoy ianao
But here there is no such thing.	saingy eto dia tsy misy toy izany
It’s not too much.	tsy dia be loatra izany
I’m talkative and crazy.	be resaka sy adala aho
For him, it works.	aminy dia miasa izany
I will always Love You.	ho tia anao foana aho
They meant so much to me.	tena nisy dikany tamiko izy ireo
In many others.	aminny maro hafa
It's still a beautiful day.	mbola andro mahafinaritra izao
Nothing is for sure.	tsy misy azo antoka mihitsy
I love you man.	tiako ianao lehilahy
You can't either.	tsy azonao atao koa
That's all we are.	izay ihany isika
You are completely wrong.	diso hevitra tanteraka ianao
You can find a way.	afaka mahita fomba ianao
It was a walking dead man.	lehilahy maty nandeha izy io
They just.	izy ireo fotsiny
I should be free.	tokony ho afaka aho
I hope there was.	manantena aho fa nisy izany
Maybe he never got there.	angamba tsy tonga tany mihitsy izy
He said a little.	kely hoy izy
Otherwise, it may not be.	raha tsy izany dia mety tsy ho izany
Assume he never existed.	ataovy hoe tsy nisy mihitsy izy
However, these options are not really available.	na izany aza ireo safidy ireo dia tsy tena misy
These are not difficult to find.	tsy sarotra ny mahita ireo
They are not just for you.	tsy natao ho anao fotsiny izy ireo
But he will not be foolish.	tsy ho adala anefa izy
But it is not from him.	tsy avy aminy anefa izany
But not much yet.	saingy tsy mbola betsaka
Doing the hard work.	manao ny asa mafy
It’s something I don’t know.	zavatra tsy fantatro izany
Then they went again.	dia nandeha indray izy ireo
He doesn’t want you to be anything else.	tsy tiany ho zavatra hafa ianao
It’s really easy and convenient.	mora sy mora tokoa izany
You know about them.	fantatrao ny momba azy ireo
And it’s harder than that.	ary sarotra kokoa noho izany
Which seems reasonable, in fact.	izay toa mety raha ny marina
Because they did nothing for us.	satria tsy nanao na inona na inona ho antsika izy ireo
But we didn't.	tsy nanao izany anefa izahay
Lots of questions.	fanontaniana be dia be
We are so happy.	faly loatra izahay
It may be different, but it’s not.	mety ho hafa izany fa tsy izany
There is only one thing that happens to us in this life.	iray ihany no mahazo antsika aminizao fiainana izao
We still have a little time today.	mbola manana fotoana kely isika anio
Without it, all this would not be possible.	raha tsy misy azy dia tsy ho tanteraka izany rehetra izany
But only the future.	fa ny ho avy ihany
In part because of the first war.	aminny ampahany noho ny ady voalohany voalohany
Reality does not need us.	tsy mila antsika ny zavamisy
Around and around and around.	manodidina sy manodidina ary manodidina
I just know that.	fantatro fotsiny izany
He had to be there for her.	tsy maintsy teo ho azy izy
I know we can do it now.	fantatro fa afaka manao izany isika izao
i just love.	tiako fotsiny
There was nothing in it.	tsy nisy na inona na inona teo aminy
But more than that, of course.	saingy mihoatra noho izany mazava ho azy
What kind.	karazana inona
It is his own.	azy manokana izany
That’s a really cool idea.	hevitra mahafinaritra tokoa izany
Big problem.	olana lehibe
Surely you are a free woman.	azo antoka fa vehivavy afaka ianao
We want to do something.	te hanao zavatra izahay
This product is history.	ity vokatra ity dia tantara
Others really didn’t.	tena tsy nanao izany ny hafa
Of course we were wrong.	mazava ho azy fa diso lalana izahay
And, of course, the biggest reason of all.	ary mazava ho azy ny antony lehibe indrindra aminny rehetra
It’s really not fun.	tena tsy mahafinaritra izany
I know you will do it for us.	fantatro fa hanao izany ho anay ianao
The place was really easy to find.	mora tokoa ny nahita ilay toerana
I had never seen such a beautiful person before.	tsy mbola nahita olona tsara tarehy toy izany aho taloha
You thought hard.	nieritreritra mafy ianao
It’s like you’re with them.	toy ny hoe miaraka aminizy ireo ianao
She looks at him and can’t get enough.	mijery azy izy ary tsy afaka ny ho ampy
It’s better for me.	tsara kokoa amiko izany
He probably already knew.	efa fantany angamba
Easy, convenient and fast.	mora mety ary haingana
Just do one thing for me.	ataovy zavatra iray fotsiny ho ahy
And ugly too.	ary ratsy tarehy koa
The ground here will be hard, of course.	ho mafy ny tany eto mazava ho azy
The time is now over.	efa lasa izao ny fotoana
That’s more than enough for one day.	mihoatra noho ny ampy iray andro izany
It's a nice house.	trano mahafinaritra io
Yes, they deserve something fun.	eny mendrika zavatra mahafinaritra izy ireo
Little did he know he was there.	tsy fantany mihitsy hoe teo izy
Maybe it’s because you had no choice.	mety ho satria tsy nanana safidy ianao
I saw him.	nahita azy aho
So it has to be all of them or not.	noho izany dia tsy maintsy ho izy rehetra na tsia
Not women, of course.	tsy ny vehivavy mazava ho azy
Keep it low.	ataovy ambany izy
And he knew them all.	ary fantany avy izy rehetra
But times could be worse.	mety ho ratsy kokoa anefa ny fotoana
This person does not exist.	tsy misy io olona io
She just really loved it and always had it.	tena tia azy fotsiny izy ary nanana izany foana
It has a lot of ideas.	manana hevitra be dia be izy io
Both are incorrect.	samy tsy marina ireo
And in fact, it started much earlier.	ary raha ny marina dia nanomboka teo aloha kokoa izany
Of course, he will be lost.	mazava ho azy fa ho very izy
Time is running out.	mandeha tokoa ny fotoana
But it could also be better.	mety ho tsara kokoa koa anefa izany
Yes, a problem.	eny olana iray
But he would have done it.	fa ho nanao izany izy
He didn’t go far anymore, he said.	tsy nandeha lavitra intsony izy hoy izy
Two possible types.	karazana mety roa
Although he is not.	na dia tsy izy aza
He seems far away from her.	toa lavitra azy izy
Yes, he would be happier than that.	eny ho faly kokoa noho izany izy
But he still did not tell the truth.	mbola tsy nilaza ny marina anefa izy
To me, however, it is more than that.	amiko anefa dia mihoatra noho izany
But we may be very close.	mety ho efa akaiky anefa isika
But only in general.	fa aminny ankapobeny ihany
He had good reason.	nanana antony tsara izy
Good if you can have both.	tsara raha afaka manana azy roa ianao
They didn't find any pictures.	tsy nahita sary izy ireo
That's good enough.	ampy tsara izao
Because he really likes it.	satria tena tiany izany
There was no one either.	tsy nisy olona koa
He is like a completely different person now.	toy ny olona hafa tanteraka izy izao
It doesn’t look good.	toa tsy tsara izany
The movement is not human.	tsy olona ny hetsika
It didn’t stay very long.	tsy nijanona ela tokoa
It starts early.	manomboka aloha izany
They deserve better than that.	mendrika tsara noho izany izy ireo
Many died, he said.	be dia be no maty hoy izy
This process begins now.	manomboka izao izany dingana izany
You can walk on the ground.	afaka mandeha aminny tany ianao
And also, of course, it has to be female.	ary koa mazava ho azy tokony ho vehivavy izany
There are not many options.	tsy misy safidy maro
But that is enough for now.	ampy izay anefa aminizao fotoana izao
He didn't need her.	tsy nila azy izy
Not you again.	tsy ianao indray
They are too small.	kely loatra izy ireo
The place is always close by.	efa akaiky foana ny toerana
In fact, it was very recent.	raha ny marina dia vao haingana be izany
That’s what they usually do.	izany matetika no manao izany
It came naturally.	tonga ho azy izany
It’s nice to be around.	mahafinaritra ny manodidina azy
And he loved them right away.	ary tia azy ireo avy hatrany izy
Of course, that never happened.	mazava ho azy fa tsy nisy mihitsy izany
This is also the best news.	izany ihany koa ny vaovao tsara indrindra
But that became difficult.	lasa sarotra anefa izany
He still has it, very easily.	mbola manana izany izy tena mora
That is not the question at all.	tsy izany mihitsy no fanontaniana
Maybe only one.	iray ihany angamba
But now he is here.	fa tonga izy izao
But whatever works.	fa na inona na inona miasa
But he did not come alone.	tsy tonga irery anefa izy
It’s the same with you.	mitovy aminny anao izany
Eventually he was completely inside.	farany dia tao anatiny tanteraka izy
And a good thing too.	ary zavatra tsara koa
Which is well worth it.	izay tena mendrika izany
Then no one sees the light.	dia tsy misy mahita ny mazava
Privacy can also be an issue.	mety ho olana koa ny fiainana manokana
The same is true for me.	marina koa izany amiko
But nothing came of it at the time.	saingy tsy nisy na inona na inona tonga taminizany fotoana izany
The first one doesn't go there anymore.	tsy mandeha any intsony ilay voalohany
That's enough talk.	efa ampy izay ny resaka
Or maybe both.	na angamba izy roa
It’s hard but it’s going to happen.	sarotra izany fa ho tanteraka izany
She is very beautiful, he said.	tena tsara tarehy izy hoy izy
Or at least.	na teny aminizany
The idea sounds silly.	toa adala ilay hevitra
We need to do well.	mila manao tsara isika
The end time can come at any time.	ny fotoana farany dia mety ho tonga aminny fotoana rehetra
Hard as it is.	mafy toa azy
And that word is very true.	ary tena marina tokoa io teny io
He didn’t like it when he did.	tsy tiany izany rehefa nanao izany izy
Not too happy about that either.	tsy dia faly aminizany koa
This may not be possible for the dead in particular.	mety tsy ho azo atao aminny maty manokana izany
He’s a really good guy, you know.	tena olona tsara izy fantatrao
He did it easily.	nanao izany mora izy
He was glad he had.	faly izy fa nanana
Do what matters.	ataovy izay zavadehibe
Yes, it is difficult to make money.	eny sarotra ny mahazo vola
You look at him now.	mijery azy ianao izao
This one was made for me.	ity iray ity dia natao ho ahy
He seems to be completely lost.	toa very tanteraka izy
But no, that was not the problem for him.	saingy tsia tsy izany no olana taminy
In doing so, they are less common.	aminizany dia tsy dia mahazatra loatra izy ireo
These people are very wrong.	tena diso ireo olona ireo
Either way, that’s not true.	na izany na tsy izany dia tsy marina izany
And sometimes it really does.	ary indraindray dia tena misy tokoa izany
Or maybe go to him.	na angamba mandeha any aminy
Right place, right time.	toerana mety fotoana mety
However, they went.	na izany aza dia nandeha izy ireo
He looked around the house again.	nijery manodidina ny trano indray izy
I started too fast.	nanomboka haingana loatra aho
He was the only one who had money.	izy irery no nanana vola
This is always a fun activity.	ity dia hetsika mahafinaritra foana
That is a real question.	fanontaniana marina izany
Nothing else.	tsy misy hafa intsony
In fact, you are a wonderful person.	raha ny marina dia olona mahafinaritra ianao
Everyone is fun.	mahafinaritra ny rehetra
We had to do something right.	tsy maintsy nanao zavatra tsara izahay
It probably won’t be like that.	tsy ho toy izany angamba
He has a lot of problems.	betsaka ny olana mahazo azy
Really downstairs.	tena tany ambany
But we were not allowed to go and see him there.	tsy nahazo nandeha nijery azy tany anefa izahay
There is nothing more important than this issue.	tsy misy zavadehibe kokoa noho ity olana ity
We are not alone.	tsy izao ihany isika
They are all good men.	lehilahy tsara daholo izy rehetra
I looked at him too.	nijery azy koa aho
Nothing else seemed too important.	tsy nisy zavatra hafa toa zavadehibe loatra
Maybe it’s still the same.	angamba mbola izany ihany
Must be done !!!.	tsy maintsy tanteraka
It wasn’t a fun thing to do.	tsy zavatra nahafinaritra izany
I want him gone.	tiako ho lasa izy
Then the next one follows.	dia manaraka izany ny manaraka
But he was too fast for me.	saingy haingana loatra izy tamiko
We work remotely.	miasa lavitra izahay
We need you very well.	mila anao tsara izahay
News about people here.	vaovao momba ny olona eto
This method should be faster.	ity fomba ity dia tokony ho haingana kokoa
Too much.	betsaka loatra
He loves being around people.	tiany ny manodidina ny olona
I still do it sometimes.	mbola manao izany foana aho indraindray
He wanted me to do better than him.	tiany hanao tsara kokoa noho izy aho
I had to do them.	tsy maintsy nanao azy ireo aho
Yes, life is hard.	eny sarotra ny fiainana
They are just good.	tsara ihany izy ireo
Because, in fact, you deserve it.	satria raha ny marina mendrika izany ianao
He stayed the night.	nijanona ny alina izy
Now or not, he thought.	izao na tsia hoy izy nieritreritra
Not next time.	tsy aminny manaraka
We are very good.	tena tsara izahay
In fact, it’s very fast from there.	raha ny marina dia tena haingana avy any
And the same is true.	ary marina koa izany
Go look around.	mandeha mijery ny manodidina
But, even so, he had no choice.	saingy na dia izany aza dia tsy nanana safidy izy
It’s almost no different.	saika tsy ho hafa izany
It’s a good life.	fiainana tsara izany
I know the one.	fantatro ilay iray
These things are very important.	tena ilaina tokoa ireo zavatra ireo
But the problem remains the same.	saingy mbola mitovy ny olana
It may not always be like that, but now.	mety tsy ho toy izany foana izy fa izao
It could still do the job.	mbola afaka nanao ilay asa izy io
I know, he said.	fantatro hoy izy
The man did not seem to know.	toa tsy fantany ilay lehilahy
But, you know a lot of people come here.	saingy fantatrao fa be dia be ny olona tonga eto
Life is so different without you here.	hafa loatra ny fiainana raha tsy misy anao eto
Lots of cars.	be dia be ny fiara
Even now it is a trivial question.	na ankehitriny aza dia fanontaniana tsy misy dikany izany
She loves this place.	tiany io toerana io
Didn't see the point in it.	tsy nahita ny hevitra tao anatiny
It was instantaneous.	teo no ho eo ihany izany
So, make sure that you follow these steps carefully.	noho izany ataovy azo antoka fa manaraka tsara ireo dingana ireo ianao
Sometimes you do.	indraindray ianao dia manao izany
But a very full day.	saingy andro iray tena feno
This is what I like.	ity no tiako
Not a process.	tsy dingana iray
I think they are wrong too.	heveriko fa diso koa izy ireo
He had not seen her the day before.	tsy nahita azy izy ny andro teo aloha
They are not necessarily bad.	tsy tonga dia ratsy izy ireo
And it’s well worth it.	ary tena mendrika izany
He’s kind of bad.	karazana ratsy izy
Of course you know they will.	mazava ho azy fa fantatrao fa hanao izany izy ireo
This is the man.	izany no lehilahy
There is one person for everyone.	misy olona iray ho anny tsirairay
Or he doesn’t like it.	na tsy tiany izany
It’s no harder than that.	tsy sarotra kokoa noho izany
There will always be people like that.	hisy foana ny olona toy izany
If they’re good, it’s the same thing.	raha tsara izy ireo dia zavatra iray ihany izany
That’s a good way.	fomba tsara izany
However, this is no longer common.	na izany aza tsy mahazatra intsony izany
Many died there.	maro no maty tany
Small is no better.	ny kely dia tsy tsara kokoa
But the truth is it is immortal.	fa ny tena marina dia tsy mety maty
It’s a fun event for everyone.	hetsika mahafinaritra ho anny rehetra izany
It’s always bad.	ratsy foana izany
I am small and beautiful.	kely sy tsara tarehy aho
But he was always there.	teo foana anefa izy
However, recently the situation is starting to be different.	na izany aza vao haingana ny zavamisy dia manomboka tsy mitovy
He doesn’t work much anymore.	tsy dia miasa intsony izy ankehitriny
But they need a private life.	mila fiainana manokana anefa izy ireo
If we have them, you will get them.	raha manana azy ireo izahay dia ho azonao
Nor is it the worst.	tsy izany koa no ratsy indrindra
We have two options for this.	manana safidy roa isika aminizany
You haven’t been there, you should.	tsy mbola nisy ianao tokony
I may be small.	mety ho kely aho
Whatever it’s worth.	na inona na inona mendrika izany
You are selfish.	tia tena ianao
Or just had it.	na nanana azy fotsiny
He’s always great.	lehibe foana izy
I don't agree with them at all.	tsy mitovy hevitra aminizy ireo mihitsy aho
I now see that this is not possible.	hitako izao fa tsy azo atao izany
Here we see something similar.	eto isika dia mahita zavatra mitovy
But that doesn't make sense now.	tsy misy dikany anefa izany ankehitriny
I want to do something about it.	tiako ny hanao zavatra momba izany
Of course, he was not around.	mazava ho azy fa tsy teo akaiky teo izy
Check it out today !.	jereo anio
But men also have many of the same problems.	saingy ny lehilahy koa dia manana olana maro mitovy
The reality is different, for sure.	tsy mitovy ny zavamisy azo antoka
He knew them when he saw them.	fantany izy ireo rehefa nahita azy ireo
The same can be done with such nonsense.	toy izany koa no azo atao aminny tsy misy dikany toy izany
They all needed it.	nila izany izy rehetra
As soon as you like.	raha vao tianao
You know when you do something.	fantatrao rehefa manao zavatra ianao
I knew it would happen.	fantatro fa hisy izany
It doesn’t really work.	tsy tena miasa
I really like it.	tiako be izany
Made to be real.	natao ho tena izy
So do all of us.	toy izany koa isika rehetra
But, there is a step.	saingy misy dingana iray
I am a man without a car.	lehilahy tsy misy fiara aho
Life is very hard.	sarotra be ny fiainana
I have mine too.	manana ny ahy koa aho
That’s a big, big part of it.	izany dia ampahany lehibe lehibe aminizany
It may not come.	mety tsy ho tonga izany
Maybe life isn’t so bad.	angamba tsy dia ratsy loatra ny fiainana
These are easy to understand.	mora azo ireo
But I got something else.	fa nahazo zavatra hafa
Someone will be there.	mba misy olona ho eo ihany
Just hope you’re just fast.	manantena fotsiny fa haingana fotsiny ianao
It will be seen that it is not.	ho hita fa tsy izany
You will lose them.	ho very azy ireo ianao
That's not a reason.	tsy antony izany
You may disagree.	mety tsy mitovy hevitra ianao
He thought to himself.	nieritreritra ny tenany izy
The situation is not the same.	tsy toy izany koa ny zavamisy
You will get there one day.	ho azonao indray andro any
But this is generally not true.	tsy marina anefa izany aminny ankapobeny
It just doesn’t seem possible.	toa tsy azo atao fotsiny izany
The new method is simple and fast.	ny fomba vaovao dia tsotra sy haingana
But this is not difficult at all.	tsy sarotra mihitsy anefa izany
But he has the money.	saingy manana ny vola izy
Couldn’t have said it better.	tsy afaka nilaza izany tsara kokoa
All ideas are mine and mine alone.	ny hevitra rehetra dia ahy ary ahy irery ihany
It’s a perfect fit.	tena mety tsara ilay izy
It may be the same at times.	mety ho toy izany koa indraindray
I am here now.	eto aho izao
There is a lot of truth.	betsaka ny marina
But it goes far beyond that.	saingy lasa lavitra noho izany
And now you have stopped.	ary izao dia nijanona ianao
He walked when he drove.	nandeha izy rehefa nandeha fiara izy
But not in the usual way.	saingy tsy aminny fomba mahazatra
It is once and there will be no more.	indray mandeha izany ary tsy hisy intsony
This man did it.	io lehilahy io no nanao izany
For himself, and he had no choice.	ho anny tenany ary tsy nanana safidy izy
I didn’t look at the time.	tsy nijery ny fotoana aho
He wants to be here and now.	te ho eto sy izao izy
But it is also the surest way.	izany koa anefa no fomba azo antoka indrindra
You work hard, it’s worth it.	miasa mafy ianao mendrika izany
This may not always be true.	mety tsy ho marina foana izany
But that doesn’t make sense anymore.	saingy tsy misy dikany intsony izany
Someone might see.	mety misy mahita
I hope it all makes sense.	manantena aho fa misy dikany ny rehetra
But one thing we lack.	saingy zavatra iray no tsy ampy antsika
i will draw.	hanao sary aho
If he should be like this.	raha tokony ho toy izao izy
I don’t need problems with these people anymore.	tsy mila olana intsony aminireo olona ireo aho
He’s not too ugly.	tsy dia ratsy tarehy loatra izy
But maybe there was.	fa angamba nisy
And, he wanted to be there.	ary te ho any izy
Crazy one time.	adala fotoana iray
But maybe they haven’t arrived by then.	saingy angamba mbola tsy tonga taminizany fotoana izany izy ireo
Two, three others died.	roa telo hafa no maty
They see far, not near.	mahita lavitra izy ireo fa tsy akaiky
Everyone made sure.	nanao antoka ny rehetra
And not everyone can do that.	ary tsy ny rehetra no afaka manao izany
Maybe more to come.	mbola maro kokoa angamba ny manaraka
He will come here.	ho tonga eto izy
It’s a little different with that.	hafa kely izy aminizany
But it’s not like he likes it.	saingy tsy toy ny tiany izany
We always need to do something.	mila manao zavatra foana isika
But that doesn't seem to be enough.	toa tsy ampy anefa izany
Of course, he saw nothing.	mazava ho azy fa tsy nahita na inona na inona izy
Maybe it’s all the same.	angamba izany rehetra izany dia mitovy
But this is not always true.	tsy marina foana anefa izany
I'm really nothing.	tena tsy inona aho
You are no different.	tsy hafa ianao
And look now.	ary jereo izao
Glad to see you going well.	faly mahita anao mandeha tsara
It all has to be good.	tsy maintsy ho tsara daholo izany
Something is not worth it.	misy zavatra tsy mendrika
There was a story about this man.	nisy tantara momba anio lehilahy io
Seems not too happy.	toa tsy faly loatra
You know everything about yourself.	fantatrao daholo ny momba anao
Better yet, we can work here.	ny tsara kokoa afaka miasa eto isika
Two days, above.	roa andro ambony
Another game.	lalao iray hafa
He works a little.	miasa kely izy
Easy, he thought.	mora hoy izy nieritreritra
Money is more important of course.	zavadehibe kokoa ny vola mazava ho azy
And then it’s gone.	ary avy eo dia tsy misy intsony
I work hard, there.	miasa mafy aho any
I couldn't stop.	tsy afaka nijanona aho
It always seems to be there.	toa ho eo foana io
They want to do something and do it right.	te hanao zavatra sy hanao izany tsara izy ireo
But many people have ideas.	saingy maro ny olona manana hevitra
So with good stuff.	koa aminny zavatra tsara
It was a very difficult time.	fotoana sarotra tokoa
The pictures are very good, but not too big.	ny sary dia tena tsara saingy tsy dia lehibe
I think that might make sense.	heveriko fa mety hisy dikany izany
It’s very different from you.	tena tsy mitovy aminao izany
There is no other way.	tsy misy lalana hafa
He goes there too.	mandeha any koa izy
Alone with him.	irery miaraka aminy
And of course, both could be right.	ary mazava ho azy mety ho marina izy roa
Three, identical to one another.	telo mitovy aminny iray hafa
They must be ten thousand.	tsy maintsy ho iray alina izy ireo
The problem is exactly that, however.	ny olana dia izany indrindra na izany aza
You just have to watch the news.	tsy maintsy mijery ny vaovao ihany ianao
It was another day of news.	andro iray hafa taminny vaovao izany
This, in general, is not true.	izany aminny ankapobeny dia tsy marina
They all are.	izy rehetra dia
The fact is, you come.	ny zavamisy dia izao tonga ianao
He did not need much money.	tsy nila vola be izy
And a lot of people.	ary be dia be ny olona
I was happy to see him.	nahafinaritra ahy ny nahita azy
They did, sort of.	nanao izy ireo karazana
That's the one.	izay ilay iray
It’s a really fun story.	tena tantara mahafinaritra tokoa izy io
He is very difficult.	tena sarotra izy
There you go.	ao ianao mandeha
No one said anything to me before.	tsy nisy nilaza na inona na inona tamiko taloha
In fact, of course, that doesn’t make sense.	raha ny marina mazava ho azy izany dia tsy misy dikany
And maybe you won’t be alone.	ary angamba tsy ho irery
Not big enough but not small either.	tsy ampy lehibe fa tsy kely ihany koa
That is a real question.	tena fanontaniana marina ilay izy
And here’s the good part.	ary toy izao ny ampahany tsara
And you are not bad.	ary tsy ratsy ianao
It is not a real word.	tsy teny tena izy akory ilay izy
But this is not for everyone.	tsy ho anny rehetra anefa izany
Overall, a nice night.	aminny ankapobeny alina mahafinaritra
Otherwise, they did as they pleased.	raha tsy izany dia nanao araka izay tiany izy ireo
As if it wasn’t real.	toy ny hoe tsy tena izy
That’s very true, but not very good.	tena marina izany saingy tsy dia tsara loatra
And now he is different.	ary ankehitriny dia hafa izy
No problem, whatever yours.	na olana na inona no anao
Everyone seems to be having fun.	toa mahafinaritra ny rehetra
Not you, not here, not now.	tsy ianao tsy eto tsy izao
Didn’t even see it there.	tsy nahita na dia teo aza ilay izy
It’s always been a bit but it’s good.	somary foana ilay izy fa tsara izany
It is often difficult.	matetika dia sarotra
It’s also a really fun car.	fiara tena mahafinaritra koa izy io
Then the game went on.	dia nandeha ny lalao
He had no idea about it.	tsy nanana hevitra momba izany izy
Otherwise, they won’t do it.	raha tsy izany dia tsy hanao izany izy ireo
Everything is important to him.	zavadehibe aminy ny zavadrehetra
But there is still time.	fa mbola misy fotoana
They work on it.	miasa aminizany izy ireo
Two years ago, it might have been longer.	roa taona lasa izay mety ho ela kokoa
I am his.	azy aho
I am absolutely right.	tena marina aho
With that we are all familiar.	miaraka aminizany isika rehetra dia mahazatra
Very bad, as it should be.	tena ratsy satria tokony
There was nothing at all.	tsy nisy na inona na inona mihitsy
There is that money.	misy io vola io
Everyone seems to know.	toa fantany ny rehetra
But that approach is good.	saingy tsara izany fomba izany
This is not safe for you.	tsy azo antoka ho anao ny eto
Probably the biggest question.	angamba ny fanontaniana lehibe indrindra
Something he still doesn't know.	zavatra mbola tsy fantany
We also don’t have to do all the work.	tsy mila manao ny asa rehetra koa isika
Just once is enough.	indray mandeha ihany fa ampy izay
He always knew that, of course.	efa fantany foana izany mazava ho azy
In fact, it has become so for many.	raha ny marina dia lasa toy izany ho anny maro
The product, is a product, is a product.	ny vokatra dia vokatra dia vokatra
One has to be with them only.	tsy maintsy miaraka aminizy ireo ihany ny iray
Everything went well.	samy nandeha tsara ny zavadrehetra
He didn't know what else.	tsy fantany izay hafa
Good, too.	tsara ihany koa
I can see the place as well.	afaka mijery ny toerana ihany koa aho
Maybe he’s not enough.	angamba tsy ampy izy
The same is true if you have done something right.	toy izany koa raha nanao zavatra tsara ianao
He likes what you know.	tiany ny zavatra fantatrao
When you can go beyond that.	rehefa afaka mihoatra izany ianao
Again, the same thing.	indray ny zavatra mitovy
Only the people inside can have information.	ny olona ao anatiny ihany no afaka manana vaovao
But I’m with that.	saingy miaraka aminizany aho
Everything seemed to go well for him.	toa nandeha tsara ho azy ny zavadrehetra
Many may have the present.	maro no mety manana ny ankehitriny
Three at a time, one for him.	telo indray mandeha iray ho azy
Just like the day before.	toy ny taminny andro teo aloha ihany
It means too much.	be loatra ny dikany
They didn’t seem human to me.	toa tsy olona tamiko izy ireo
I get all that money.	mahazo izany vola rehetra izany aho
He was never the first choice.	tsy izy mihitsy no safidy voalohany
I’m crazy to do that.	adala aho manao izany
Just a general idea.	hevitra ankapobeny fotsiny
For me personally.	amiko manokana ity
It’s better than nothing.	tsara kokoa noho ny tsy misy izany
He is the last.	izy no farany
There are those that are hard to find.	misy ireo sarotra hita
It’s nice to see them work.	mahafinaritra ny mahita azy ireo miasa
But sometimes that is not possible.	saingy indraindray dia tsy azo atao izany
But that still doesn’t work.	mbola tsy mandeha ihany anefa izany
There was simply no other option.	tsy nisy safidy hafa fotsiny
You don’t even know they are there.	tsy fantatrao akory fa any izy ireo
There was no more.	tsy nisy intsony
But it did.	saingy nanao izany
Finally he told me two things.	taminny farany dia nilaza zavatra roa tamiko izy
Everything is important.	zavadehibe ny zavadrehetra
He is very unselfish.	tena tsy tia tena izy
But nothing is easy.	tsy misy zavatra mora anefa
Yes, thank you.	eny misaotra
Finally he looked at them.	farany dia nijery azy ireo izy
The happy time is very near.	tena akaiky ny fotoana mahafinaritra
Very wrong.	tena diso be
And they love him.	ary tia azy izy ireo
He was in it.	tao anatiny izy
I love this game for many reasons.	tiako ity lalao ity noho ny antony maro
You are full of it.	feno izany ianao
They are dead.	efa maty izy ireo
He also earned money.	nahazo vola koa
Not so now.	tsy toy izany ankehitriny
But the movement does not go alone.	tsy mandeha irery anefa ny hetsika
So you have to go.	ka tsy maintsy mandeha ianao
This is a good choice for a trip.	ity dia safidy tsara ho anny dia
There are not many options.	tsy betsaka ny safidy
That is probably true.	izay angamba no marina
We cannot exist without it.	tsy afaka ny hisy isika raha tsy misy izany
There may be many.	mety misy maro be
Enough here.	ampy eto
I work for myself.	miasa ho ahy aho
We will be really stupid.	ho tena adala tokoa isika
All pictures are correct.	marina daholo ny sary rehetra
He must have seen it too.	tsy maintsy nahita anio koa izy
If you want, enough is enough.	raha tianao dia ampy
A few of these go a long way.	ny kely aminireo dia mandeha lavitra be
I think you are too.	heveriko fa ianao koa
If not good.	raha tsy tsara
We have to be honest with people.	tokony hanao ny marina aminny olona isika
Don't do anything else.	aza manao zavatra hafa
We always have a good fight.	manana ady tsara foana izahay
All of this seems old fashioned.	izany rehetra izany dia toa fomba taloha
The first will come to you.	ho avy aminao ny voalohany
And it won’t be easy.	ary tsy ho mora izany
It’s a picture, a picture, a picture of you.	izany dia sary sary sary anao
Their locations are very different.	samy hafa be ny toerana misy azy
Sure he would do it now, but he didn’t.	azo antoka fa hanao izany izy izao saingy tsy nanao izany
You can do something very different.	afaka manao zavatra tena hafa ianao
I really like a lot of ideas.	tena tiako ny hevitra maro
We are lost without you.	very izahay tsy misy anao
It didn't make much sense to him.	tsy dia nisy dikany taminy izany
You are not even here.	tsy eto akory ianao
But they didn’t get it all.	saingy tsy nahazo azy rehetra izy ireo
It has a history and meaning.	manana tantara sy dikany izy io
I’m a job, that’s all.	asa aho izay ihany
This one has become my favorite so far.	ity iray ity no lasa tiako indrindra aminizao fotoana izao
It did the perfect job.	nanao ny asa tanteraka izany
Absolutely bad job.	asa ratsy tanteraka
It means a lot to us.	misy dikany lehibe ho antsika izany
It doesn’t seem like much of everything about him.	toa tsy dia lehibe loatra ny zavadrehetra momba azy
Not very good either.	tsy dia tsara ihany koa
This is the most difficult process but the most necessary process.	ity no dingana sarotra indrindra fa ny dingana tena ilaina
Like a fool.	toy ny adala
There it is, here it is.	eo io eto
The woman was nothing.	tsy nisy inona ny vehivavy
Real men would never do that.	tsy hanao izany mihitsy ny tena lehilahy
But it’s not real.	saingy tsy tena izy io
And when they do.	ary rehefa manao izany izy ireo dia
Yes, that would be good.	eny ho tsara izany
He wanted to be as close to people as possible.	tiany ho akaiky ny olona araka izay azo atao izy
Unless they are better.	raha tsy hoe tsara kokoa izy ireo
He never looked at her.	tsy nijery azy mihitsy izy
Everything seems to be going well, though.	toa mandeha tsara ny zavadrehetra na izany aza
Do it for all of us.	ataovy ho antsika rehetra izany
We were able to stay there.	afaka nijanona teo izahay
Very close, though.	tena saika na izany aza
He just left.	vao lasa izy
All problems are difficult for me.	sarotra amiko ny olana rehetra
Thank you for being so kind to him.	misaotra anao fa tena tsara taminy
That is the most important thing to me.	izany no zavadehibe indrindra amiko
Thank you to all of us.	misaotra antsika rehetra
It's been like that for a long time.	efa ela no toy izany
So it’s good too.	noho izany dia tsara ihany koa
But one last question.	fanontaniana iray farany anefa
But it will come.	fa ho avy io
Some travel may be necessary.	mety ilaina ny dia sasany
I don’t think you can do anything else.	heveriko fa tsy afaka manao zavatra hafa ianao
Yes, they are free.	eny afaka izy ireo
I don’t do them any other way.	tsy manao azy ireo aminny fomba hafa aho
It’s not very fast, but it goes well.	tsy dia haingana izy io fa mandeha tsara
It is everything at once.	izy io dia ny zavadrehetra aminny fotoana iray ihany
Of course, this is a very bad idea.	mazava ho azy fa hevitra tena ratsy izany
It can't be either.	tsy mety ho izany koa
It may or may not be bad for you.	mety ho ratsy aminao izany na tsia
But I know where we are.	fantatro anefa ny misy anay
But that is often the case.	toy izany matetika anefa isika
We have seen such good things.	nahita zavatra tsara toy izany izahay
The future is just beginning.	mbola vao manomboka izao ho avy izao
He may already be here.	mety efa eto izy
And yet, there isn’t much work to be done.	ary na izany aza tsy dia misy asa be loatra
You can do that now.	afaka manao izany ianao izao
Home is home.	trano no trano
From below.	avy any ambany
Most crazy to me.	adala indrindra amiko
Not too long ago.	tsy ela izao
It takes time to get the full picture.	mila fotoana vao mahazo sary feno
There are some.	misy ny sasany
But this is not new.	tsy vaovao anefa izany
Everything seems to be going well.	toa mandeha araka ny tokony ho izy ny zavadrehetra
All fools.	ny adala rehetra
The day is very hard.	tena mafy ny andro
It starts with you now.	manomboka aminao izao
And it’s really beautiful.	ary tena tsara tarehy tokoa
That's all for now.	izay ihany aloha izao
It’s a simple idea.	hevitra tsotra izany
They are not happy about all this.	tsy faly izy ireo aminizany rehetra izany
Only once at first, and then again.	indray mandeha ihany aminny voalohany ary avy eo indray
New problems.	olana vaovao
We become happy.	lasa faly isika
And there could be many more.	ary mety hisy maro hafa koa
It may not be worth it.	mety ho tsy mendrika izany
Hope all is well.	manantena fa tsara daholo ny rehetra
There is no day.	tsy misy andro
Do it in as many steps as possible.	ataovy aminny dingana azo atao
You were where He wanted you to be.	teo aminny toerana tiany hisy anao ianao
So what's the problem ?.	dia inona no olana
This is not going to be great.	tsy mbola ho lehibe ity
Not a nice guy by any means.	tsy lehilahy mahafinaritra aminny fomba rehetra
It’s never going to be pretty.	tsy ho tsara tarehy mihitsy izany
They should be better.	tokony ho tsara kokoa izy ireo
In fact, it works in part.	raha ny marina dia miasa aminny ampahany
You may be right.	mety ho marina ianao
This is a big step in this process.	ity dia dingana lehibe aminity dingana ity
They are all lost.	very daholo ireo
Apparently so.	toa izany tokoa
People will be human.	ho olona ny olona
I think this time is good.	heveriko fa tsara ity fotoana ity
And it’s not stupid but it’s true.	ary tsy adala izany fa marina
However, it is close.	na izany aza dia efa akaiky
He was the best, best of all.	izy no tsara indrindra tsara indrindra taminny zavadrehetra
But these are no more.	tsy misy intsony anefa ireo
And things got to them very quickly.	ary haingana be ny zavamisy nahazo azy ireo
Not about himself, of course.	tsy momba ny tenany mazava ho azy
But there was still the issue of timing.	saingy mbola nisy ny olana momba ny fotoana
He had to stop doing it.	tsy maintsy nijanona tsy nanao izany intsony izy
But there is a problem.	saingy misy olana iray
It’s not hard to see why.	tsy sarotra ny nahita ny antony
He is one of the greatest.	izy no iray aminireo be indrindra
I think that’s true in life.	heveriko fa marina aminny fiainana izany
But if you need us.	fa raha mila anay ianao
There are two stages to this game.	misy dingana roa aminity lalao ity
Things are not too bad.	tsy dia ratsy loatra ny zavatra
I still have each of them.	mbola manana ny tsirairay aminizy ireo aho
Really wrong problem.	tena olana diso
Like the right words.	toy ny teny marina
You may not do that.	mety tsy hanao izany ianao
But he always is.	fa izy foana
You are in the game now.	ao aminny lalao ianao izao
Clear timing.	fotoana mazava tsara
It may be just that.	mety ho izay ihany
And they were everywhere.	ary teny rehetra teny izy ireo
That is the bad news.	izany no vaovao ratsy
And he still does.	ary mbola manao izany foana izy
Future action is uncertain.	tsy azo antoka ny hetsika ho avy
We will come to you.	ho avy aminao izahay
And for some, it seems so.	ary ho anny sasany dia toa izany
You don’t look too low.	tsy mijery ambany loatra ianao
He never has that problem.	tsy manana io olana io mihitsy izy
It is as follows.	dia izao manaraka izao
I don’t expect anything from you right now.	tsy manantena na inona na inona aminao aho izao
Now, the meaning is clear.	aminizao fotoana izao mazava tsara ny dikany
They are very important here.	tena zavadehibe tokoa izy ireo eto
This is for women.	ity dia natao ho anny vehivavy
But no, you are right.	fa tsia marina ny anao
There are many things you can do about it.	betsaka ny zavatra azonao atao aminizany
There are no two thousand.	tsy misy roa alina
I want to do that in the future.	te hanao izany aho aminny ho avy
For what only.	ho anny inona ihany
We needed something.	nila zavatra izahay
I know about these.	fantatro ny momba ireo
Or mine may not work at all.	na mety tsy mandeha mihitsy ny ahy
Everything in simple terms.	ny zavatra rehetra aminny tsotra
Everything is too far away.	lavitra loatra ny zavadrehetra
It really did it for me.	tena nanao izany tamiko izany
Everything else is meaningless.	ny zavatra hafa rehetra dia tsy misy dikany
The question is different.	hafa ny fanontaniana
This process is very easy.	ity dingana ity dia tena mora
No action is needed at this time.	tsy misy hetsika ilaina aminizao fotoana izao
They will come here at any time.	ho tonga eto izy ireo aminny fotoana rehetra
I have been thinking about them for a long time.	efa ela aho no nieritreritra azy ireo
He always did the right thing.	nanao ny tsara foana izy
Do it right.	manao izany araka ny tokony ho izy
He never wanted to lose anything.	tsy te ho very na inona na inona mihitsy izy
Take a closer look at the game.	jereo akaiky ny lalao
But that really doesn’t make sense.	tena tsy misy dikany anefa izany
It will be better than ours.	ho tsara kokoa noho ny antsika izany
Or it could have another meaning.	na mety misy dikany hafa izany
He can do the same.	afaka manao izany koa izy
He was very happy, he said.	faly be izy hoy izy
Right now you’re pretty much in the right place.	aminizao fotoana izao dia tena araka ny tokony ho izy ianao
It’s like a woman.	toy ny vehivavy izany
Sometimes it even works.	indraindray aza miasa
What is this ?.	inona ity
He was happy when night came.	faly izy rehefa tonga ny alina
He is an insignificant man.	lehilahy tsy misy dikany izy
There is no question of money anymore.	tsy misy resaka vola intsony
We became men tonight.	lasa lehilahy izahay anio alina
There was no one else.	tsy nisy hafa mihitsy
We can be like that again.	afaka ny ho toy izany indray isika
We are there.	eo izahay
I saw him there.	hitako teo izy
Don't even look at him.	aza mijery azy akory
All that was before now.	izay rehetra teo aloha ankehitriny
It doesn't suit him at all.	tsy mety aminy mihitsy izany
But others did not.	fa ny hafa tsy nanao izany
I now have two houses.	manana trano roa aho izao
I never thought it would be easy.	tsy nieritreritra mihitsy aho hoe ho mora izany
Some have more than others.	ny sasany dia manana mihoatra noho ny hafa
Not some, all.	tsy ny sasany ny rehetra
No one can do that well.	tsy dia misy olona afaka manao izany tsara
We went in two parts.	nandeha taminny ampahany roa izahay
It was not done to him.	tsy natao taminy izany
A good woman loves you.	vehivavy tsara tia anao
It is no longer empty.	tsy foana intsony ilay izy
If you can.	raha mba afaka
You could too.	mety ho ianao koa
It is not an option at all.	tsy safidy mihitsy izany
He is currently working on a story.	miasa aminny tantara iray izy aminizao fotoana izao
It still didn’t make sense.	mbola tsy nisy dikany izany
Just simple.	tsotra ihany
And he knew we couldn’t.	ary fantany fa tsy afaka izahay
Not everyone will be there for us.	tsy ny rehetra no ho eo ho antsika
Right now, this is too new.	aminizao fotoana izao dia vaovao loatra izany
They couldn’t see farther than this kind of beautiful picture.	tsy afaka nahita lavitra noho io karazana sary tsara tarehy io izy ireo
They are also wrong.	tsy mety koa izy ireo
Very, very fast.	be haingana be
It's not like you.	tsy toa anao izany
But not here, not now.	fa tsy eto tsy izao
He really loves to draw.	tena tia manao sary izy
It's not even close.	tsy akaiky akory izany
It's too simple.	tsotra loatra izany
Many come from within.	maro no tonga avy ao anatiny
But that is another problem.	olana hafa anefa izany
It has gone too far.	lasa lavitra loatra izany
Something you may not know very well.	zavatra mety tsy dia fantatrao loatra
But it could be the same.	saingy mety ho toy izany koa
But you have to look at it differently.	saingy tsy maintsy mijery azy aminny fomba hafa ianao
And she is beautiful.	ary tsara tarehy izy
The easiest is not always the best.	ny mora indrindra dia tsy ny tsara indrindra foana
And that's true.	dia marina izany
And now he can't.	ary ankehitriny tsy afaka izy
I was almost lost there.	saika very teo aho
The location is current.	ny toerana dia aminizao fotoana izao
If you are older.	raha lehibe ianao
The past does not go that way.	tsy mandeha toy izany ny lasa
One you may know, one you may not.	ny iray mety ho fantatrao ny iray mety tsy
It wasn’t that close.	tsy teo akaiky teo izany
Too hard and too fast.	mafy loatra ary haingana loatra
I didn’t do anything special.	tsy nanao zavatra manokana aho
And you may be right.	ary mety marina ny anao
That’s what’s really here.	izany no tena eto
I didn’t get it.	tsy nahazo izany aho
It took us a long time to see you.	ela be izahay vao nahita anao
It’s certainly not a food issue.	azo antoka fa tsy resaka sakafo izany
And there were a lot of great ones.	ary nisy be dia be ny lehibe
He is still two.	mbola roa izy
That’s because they have it.	izany dia satria manana izany
Someone owns land here.	misy olona manana tany eto izay
Everyone just looked down.	nijery ambany fotsiny ny rehetra
Some things in life have to come to naught.	ny zavatra sasany eo aminny fiainana dia tsy maintsy tonga aminny tsy misy dikany
If it really is, that is it.	raha tena izy dia izay
They said yes.	hoy izy ireo hoe eny
This is not possible at this time.	tsy azo atao izany aminizao fotoana izao
Soon someone will come.	tsy ho ela dia hisy olona ho avy
There are many other such places.	betsaka ny toerana hafa toy izany
I think he really liked the problem.	heveriko fa tena tiany ilay olana
Then he was gone.	dia tsy teo intsony izy
I know that sounds crazy.	fantatro fa toa adala izany
That’s not what matters.	tsy izany no zavadehibe
The important thing is that it doesn’t need them.	ny zavadehibe dia ny hoe tsy mila azy ireo izany
We are now looking at the big results.	mijery ny vokatra lehibe isika izao
To me, that’s great.	amiko dia lehibe izany
It may come naturally.	mety ho tonga ho azy izany
Thank you so much for this.	misaotra betsaka aminity
He had a good day.	nanana andro tsara izy
They came quickly.	tonga haingana izy ireo
It’s far harder than reality.	sarotra lavitra ny zavamisy
He was still drawing.	mbola nanao sary ihany izy
This is also not possible in many places.	tsy azo atao koa izany any aminny toerana maro
The right words are good.	tsara ny teny mety
Everything is a method.	ny zavadrehetra dia fomba
But you have no idea.	saingy tsy manana hevitra ianao
The food is delicious and fresh.	mahafinaritra sy vaovao ny sakafo
I don't see him or her.	tsy hitako izy na izy
Neither did mine.	tsy nisy koa ny ahy
Now he is alone.	ankehitriny dia irery izy
This is not a difficult process.	tsy dingana sarotra izany
I am one of those people.	iray aminireo olona ireo aho
Unless you don’t want to go there.	raha tsy hoe tsy te ho any
You are only here.	eto ihany ianao
Worth it, something is wrong.	mendrika misy diso
That’s everything.	izay ny zavadrehetra
This is somewhat true, but not entirely true.	somary marina izany saingy tsy marina tanteraka
He goes the other way.	mandeha aminny lalana hafa izy
It was simple and straightforward.	tsotra sy tsotra ilay izy
It's a matter of money.	resaka vola io
It's always been that way with you.	toy izany foana ny aminao
But the timing is the same.	mitovy ihany anefa ny fotoana
Looks like old news.	toa vaovao taloha
It’s all ours.	anay daholo izany
And he already knew that day.	ary efa fantany izany andro izany
He works that way.	miasa toy izany izy
Very happy to have you here.	tena faly manana anao eto
Still true to me, in fact.	mbola marina amiko raha ny marina
The greatest moment.	ny fotoana lehibe indrindra
Not because it made sense.	tsy hoe satria nisy dikany izany
He is not a very important person.	tsy olona tena lehibe izy
Never looked at him.	tsy nijery azy mihitsy
Really did it.	tena nanao izany
The issue is the same.	mitovy ny resaka
And no, we didn’t have a house anymore.	ary tsia tsy nanana trano intsony izahay
I still don’t like it at all.	mbola tsy tia anio mihitsy aho
In general, this is the worst.	aminny ankapobeny dia io no ratsy indrindra
Now the time has come for him.	tonga izao ny fotoana ho azy
This is especially important if you know the person well.	tena ilaina izany raha fantatrao tsara ilay olona
But there was nothing there.	tsy nisy na inona na inona anefa tao
It’s always nice to be around him.	tsara foana ny manodidina azy
The game doesn't work.	tsy mandeha ny lalao
We have time for three questions.	manana fotoana ho anny fanontaniana telo izahay
We have more than anything.	manana mihoatra noho ny zavatra rehetra isika
But it can also be fun.	fa mety mahafinaritra koa
Now he knows you are there.	ankehitriny dia fantany fa eo ianao
He looked away again.	nijery lavitra indray izy
It’s about the person.	momba ilay olona io
Not that there was much about it.	tsy hoe nisy zavatra betsaka taminizany
You are not just beautiful.	tsy tsara tarehy fotsiny ianao
I know that face.	fantatro io tarehy io
We had a lot.	nanana be dia be izahay
They had to die immediately.	tsy maintsy maty teo no ho eo izy ireo
I work weekdays.	miasa andro mahazatra aho
It’s all hard.	sarotra daholo izany
He had it too.	nanana izany koa izy
People often came and went.	matetika no tonga sy nandeha ny olona
This is very easy to mistake.	tena mora diso izany
It sounds like good news.	toa vaovao tsara ilay izy
You know the man loves you.	fantatrao fa tia anao ilay lehilahy
With others, no.	miaraka aminny hafa tsia
These are the best times.	ireo no fotoana tsara indrindra
A man finds himself lost in this world.	ny lehilahy iray dia mahita ny tenany ho very eto aminity tontolo ity
It's not from me.	tsy avy amiko izany
But that's bad.	fa ratsy izany
I used to be very happy.	faly be aho taloha
But there was a problem with that approach.	nisy olana anefa taminizany fomba izany
And we don’t just love good women.	ary tsy hoe tia vehivavy tsara ihany isika
Where I am, the day is always night.	any aminny toerana misy ahy dia alina foana ny andro
But he liked it.	saingy tiany izany
I think it could be the same.	heveriko fa mety ho izany ihany
Then he kept saying.	avy eo dia nilaza hatrany izy
So, it’s fun to do these things.	noho izany mahafinaritra ny manao ireo zavatra ireo
That’s probably the next best thing.	izany angamba no zavatra tsara indrindra manaraka
He didn’t like her, and she didn’t like him.	tsy tiany izy ary tsy tiany
That’s just a good approach.	fomba tsara ihany izany
Nothing else does that.	tsy misy zavatra hafa manao izany
Of course, there are many other options.	mazava ho azy fa misy safidy maro hafa
So go another one.	koa mandeha iray hafa
I think we all need good news.	heveriko fa mila vaovao tsara isika rehetra
I love him, yes.	tiako izy eny
Someone died, they said.	misy olona maty hoy izy ireo
All three are starting to go well.	manomboka mandeha tsara izy telo ireo
You know, so.	fantatrao ka
You should have seen it.	tokony efa nahita azy ianao
It was like a whole other house.	toy ny trano iray hafa tanteraka ilay izy
I really like him, of course.	tena tia azy aho mazava ho azy
Thanks for the story.	misaotra taminny tantara
Because, yes, it’s the same.	satria eny mitovy ihany izany
The end is near for both of us.	efa akaiky ny farany ho anay roa
They are alone now.	izy ireo irery izao
And then the car.	ary avy eo ny fiara
The problem is.	ny olana dia
They were made too well.	natao tsara loatra izy ireo
Maybe in some places, but not all.	angamba any aminny toerana sasany fa tsy ny rehetra
We need something else.	mila zavatra hafa isika
It was harder to get.	sarotra kokoa ny nahazo azy
Some are already here.	efa eto ny sasany
Maybe he really did.	angamba tena nanao izany izy
People told me it would happen.	nilaza tamiko ny olona fa hisy izany
You went really well.	tena nandeha tsara ianao
This is bad news.	vaovao ratsy izany
There was always a way.	nisy fomba foana
As it should be.	toy ny tokony ho izy
From here it is difficult.	avy eto dia sarotra
She is so good.	tsara toy izany izy
I like the simple way.	tiako ny fomba tsotra
All of them, or almost the same.	izy rehetra na saika mitovy
But he knew it would not come.	fantany anefa fa tsy ho avy izany
He looks like me, you know.	toa ahy izy fantatrao
Then I said yes right away.	dia hoy aho hoe eny avy hatrany
It's a part of life.	ampahany aminny fiainana izany
We all just stopped.	nijanona fotsiny izahay rehetra
Both are possible.	samy azo atao
And in fact, it’s not too bad.	ary raha ny marina tsy dia ratsy loatra izany
But that seems to have been a long time coming.	toa efa ela be anefa izany
We made more money in many ways.	nahazo vola bebe kokoa izahay taminny fomba maro
Now, however, the real work begins.	ankehitriny anefa dia manomboka ny tena asa
Such a beautiful thing.	zavatra tsara tarehy toy izany
Especially men.	indrindra ny lehilahy
You can do this at any time.	afaka manao izany ianao aminny fotoana rehetra
He works for himself.	miasa ny tenany izy
The latter is very important.	tena zavadehibe ity farany
I will never do that to you.	tsy hanao izany aminao mihitsy aho
I have nothing else for you right now.	tsy manana zavatra hafa ho anao aho aminizao fotoana izao
I have no idea in general.	tsy manana hevitra aho aminny ankapobeny
Some even do it now.	misy aza manao izany ankehitriny
He is very ugly.	tena ratsy tarehy izy
However, this is not suitable for everyone.	na izany aza tsy mety aminny olona rehetra izany
They are two different things.	zavatra roa samy hafa izy ireo
It didn’t make sense to me at all.	tsy nisy dikany tamiko mihitsy izany
About this life.	momba ity fiainana ity
It’s been over for years.	mihoatra ny taona izany
And they are fun.	ary mahafinaritra azy ireo
Not as good as the story, but still good.	tsy dia tsara toy ny tantara fa mbola tsara
This is for three reasons.	izany no antony telo
I have more questions.	manana fanontaniana bebe kokoa aho
i need a little more.	mila kely kokoa aho
And it follows that.	ary manaraka izany ny
You are just getting started.	vao manomboka ianao
What is close.	inona no akaiky
There was good news and bad news.	nisy vaovao tsara sy vaovao ratsy
It was there again.	teo indray ilay izy
I disagree.	tsy mitovy hevitra aho
Because it could have happened.	satria mety ho nisy izany
He didn’t start anything.	tsy nanomboka na inona na inona izy
You just hope.	manantena fotsiny ianao
I don’t know that, but something.	tsy fantany izay fa zavatra
The type you know isn’t too big.	tsy dia lehibe loatra ilay karazana fantatrao
The problem is it’s bad.	ny olana dia ratsy izany
Image for photo.	sary ho anny sary
In the long run, we have to do it.	rehefa ela ny ela dia tsy maintsy manao izany isika
We need people like that to come here.	mila olona toy izany izahay ho avy eto
Yes, we are already there.	eny efa any isika
He would have said so.	ho nilaza izany izy
You really can't walk.	tena tsy afaka mandeha ianao
But one day it was too much.	saingy indray andro dia be loatra izany
They are very common.	tena mahazatra izy ireo
I still have it somewhere.	mbola manana izany aho any ho any
You know it’s hard for people here.	fantatrao fa sarotra ho anny olona eto
I love that way.	tiako izany fomba izany
And it’s easy to work with.	ary mora ny miasa
If we were alone, we would not do it.	raha isika irery ihany dia tsy hanao izany
Kind of.	karazana
I want it to be a special place for us.	tiako ho toerana manokana ho antsika izany
She is beautiful, he said.	tsara tarehy izy hoy izy
Then he looked around.	dia nijery manodidina izy
Well, the car is gone.	eny ary lasa ilay fiara
In fact, it will be very hard.	raha ny marina dia ho mafy be izany
These men love her.	tia azy ireo lehilahy ireo
Then he saw her.	dia nahita azy
But that is foolish.	adala anefa izany
But it doesn’t work for a reason.	saingy tsy mandeha izany noho ny antony
It may be obvious, but it’s not.	mety ho hita mazava tsara izany saingy tsy izany
This and other things.	izany sy ny zavatra hafa
It wasn’t just in him, he said.	tsy tao aminy fotsiny izany hoy izy
You said you would.	nilaza ianao fa hanao izany
I have to be around.	tsy maintsy manodidina aho
And the world seemed to be watching.	ary toa nijery izao tontolo izao
They had to be there when they did.	tsy maintsy nisy izy ireo rehefa nanao izany
He looked around quickly.	nijery manodidina haingana izy
Now that’s not always a problem.	ankehitriny dia tsy olana foana izany
That night was everything.	io alina io no zavadrehetra
It was fun and that’s it.	nahafinaritra ilay izy ary izany no izy
It’s more than just doing it.	mihoatra noho ny manao fotsiny izany
He is also a good person.	olona tsara ihany koa izy
Either one or the other.	na ny iray na ny iray
And about him.	ary ny momba azy
The contents are empty.	foana ny ao anatiny
I might have it.	mety manana izany aho
It is clear that he is here.	mazava be fa ao aminy izy eto
These appear to be true.	hita fa marina ireo
They don’t want to come.	tsy te ho avy izy ireo
It just isn’t enough.	tsy ampy fotsiny izany
We both need to work.	mila miasa isika roa
It was never a pleasant time.	tsy fotoana nahafinaritra mihitsy izany
But, enough is enough about the future.	saingy ampy ny momba ny ho avy
But it was still fun.	saingy mbola nahafinaritra
They said it used to be.	nilaza izy ireo fa taloha
Although it really looks like one.	na dia tena toa iray aza
I really have no problem with it.	tena tsy manana olana aminy aho
Because he could almost imagine such a life.	satria saika afaka nieritreritra ny fiainana toy izany izy
In general, this is not the case.	aminny ankapobeny dia tsy izany no izy
But it’s not very good for you.	saingy tsy dia tsara loatra aminao izany
I love you and had a great day.	tiako ianao ary nahafinaritra ny andro
I had nothing to lose.	tsy nanana na inona na inona ho very aho
Went very fast, very fast.	nandeha haingana be haingana be
And he is not at all.	dia tsy izany mihitsy izy
However it is not certain.	na izany aza tsy azo antoka
There is no real money.	tsy misy tena vola
So, you shouldn’t overdo it.	noho izany tsy tokony ho be loatra ianao
And they went and did so.	dia nandeha izy ireo ka nanao izany
They also did a good job.	nanao asa tsara koa izy ireo
There were many possible ways.	nisy fomba maro azo natao
And that is very clear.	ary mazava be izany
Some people have them do it.	ny olona sasany dia manana azy ireo hanao izany
Sometimes they are together, but not always.	indraindray izy ireo dia miaraka fa tsy foana
He never stopped.	tsy nijanona mihitsy izy
He did not know that it was so bad.	tsy fantany hoe ratsy be ilay izy
But I don’t like doing them.	tsy tiako anefa ny manao azy ireo
But not all is lost.	tsy mbola very daholo anefa
He is no longer well.	tsy tsara intsony izy
This news will never be good.	tsy ho tsara mihitsy izany vaovao izany
I follow a lot of people.	manaraka olona maro aho
He loves games.	tia lalao izy
That could be really big.	mety ho lehibe tokoa izany
It’s even more than meets the eye.	mbola betsaka kokoa noho ny hita izany
Or maybe he’s crazy.	na angamba adala izy
There is no shortage of action.	tsy misy hetsika tsy ampy
But here we are both.	saingy eto isika roa
Do the last one.	ataovy ny farany
Sometimes life has no meaning at all.	tsy nisy dikany mihitsy indraindray ny fiainana
It could be.	mety ho izany
Still loving You.	mbola tia anao
Not so easy.	tsy dia mora
That really should be enough.	tena tokony ho ampy izany
I can't see them very well.	tsy hitako tsara izy ireo
He did though.	nanao izany izy na izany aza
This work is as follows.	ity asa ity dia izao manaraka izao
She loves this picture.	tiany io sary io
The method has two main steps.	ny fomba dia manana dingana roa lehibe
Maybe it would be better.	angamba ho tsara kokoa
Not really, but close.	tsy tena fa akaiky
Someone came first.	nisy olona tonga tany aloha
See if he's around.	jereo raha manodidina izy
Maybe he needed food.	nila sakafo angamba izy
Yes, we should be closer.	eny tokony ho akaiky kokoa isika
Two cars went.	fiara roa nandeha
I really like this part.	tena tiako ity ampahany ity
I don’t want to do either.	tsy te hanao koa aho
They were fun and enjoyable.	nahafinaritra sy nahafinaritra izy ireo
He has a history.	manana tantara izy
Great, fun game.	lalao lehibe mahafinaritra
People like him.	olona mitovy aminy

I haven't been there yet.	mbola tsy tonga any aho
All of this is going well.	izany rehetra izany dia mandeha tsara
Nothing was gained.	tsy nisy na inona na inona azo
He said it was unusual.	nilaza izy fa tsy mahazatra izany
And maybe they are.	ary angamba izy ireo
Life is moving so fast now.	mandeha haingana be izao ny fiainana
They could not get there if they went too fast.	tsy afaka tonga tany izy ireo raha nandeha haingana
You need to work on it.	mila miasa aminizany ianao
But not all ideas are perfect.	tsy ny hevitra rehetra anefa no tena tsara
It’s really hard.	sarotra tokoa izany
We looked inside closest.	nijery ny tao anatiny akaiky indrindra izahay
This is a problem.	olana izao
And because even now he thought of her.	ary satria na dia izao aza dia nieritreritra azy izy
He already knows now.	efa fantany koa izao
They both looked there but saw nothing.	samy nijery teo izy ireo fa tsy nahita na inona na inona
I have another question.	manana fanontaniana iray hafa aho
I was still around.	mbola teo aminny manodidina aho
It has to go.	tsy maintsy mandeha izany
Sometimes, it just takes time.	indraindray mila fotoana fotsiny izany
It will never happen.	tsy ho tanteraka mihitsy izany
There is a wonderful place.	misy toerana mahafinaritra
Things, things, words.	zavatra zavatra teny
Some even love you.	misy aza tia anao
Easy enough work.	asa mora ampy
There will be more.	mbola hisy bebe kokoa
It was a fun event.	hetsika nahafinaritra ilay izy
Absolutely no problem.	tena tsy misy olana
The worse.	ny ratsy kokoa
It was a long way.	lalana lavitra ilay izy
He already knew, and he didn’t do anything.	efa fantany ary tsy nanao na inona na inona izy
It’s also very uncertain.	tena tsy azo antoka koa izany
I am right.	marina aho
I enjoy working with others.	faly aho miasa aminny hafa
Everything is just complicated.	sarotra fotsiny ny zavadrehetra
He looked at the other men.	nijery ireo lehilahy hafa izy
Of course you can.	mazava ho azy fa afaka ianao
The other thing is when.	ny zavatra hafa dia rehefa
He did it all.	izy no nanao izany rehetra izany
Because they may never know.	satria mety tsy ho fantany mihitsy
Time is not needed.	tsy ilaina ny fotoana
I walked a long way.	nandeha lavitra aho
Not because of me.	tsy noho ny amiko
Have a nice year.	taona mahafinaritra
Some are good, and some are bad.	misy tsara ary misy ratsy
He doesn't have enough money.	tsy ampy vola izy
Many others have done the same.	olona maro hafa koa no nanao izany
Yes, that man.	eny io lehilahy io
No, not the earth.	tsia tsy ny tany
But they are.	fa izy ireo
Don’t do too much again.	aza atao be loatra indray
And no one dies.	ary tsy misy maty
I walk.	mandeha aho
Simple and straightforward, difficult.	tsotra sy tsotra sarotra
And he deserves it, you know.	ary mendrika izany izy fantatrao
It also seems like a lot of work.	toa asa be ihany koa izany
I'm happy too.	faly koa aho
Due to ambiguity, he was unable to do so.	noho ny tsy mazava dia tsy afaka nanao izany
He seemed so real that he didn’t exist.	toa tena nisy izy ka tsy nisy
I think it went well.	heveriko fa nandeha tsara
Now this is common.	ankehitriny dia efa mahazatra izany
I could never think of anything else.	tsy afaka nieritreritra zavatra hafa mihitsy aho
Not sure if this is true.	tsy azo antoka raha marina izany
But that was enough for me.	ampy ho ahy anefa izany
We did it in one step.	nanao izany izahay taminny dingana iray
Something about you.	zavatra momba anao
That day will come to you too.	ho avy aminao koa izany andro izany
But I disagree with the end result.	tsy mitovy hevitra aminny vokatra farany anefa aho
It doesn’t need to be harder than that.	tsy mila sarotra kokoa noho izany
Over and over again.	hatrany hatrany
This is the best place.	izany no toerana tsara indrindra
Maybe he shouldn’t have said anything.	angamba tsy tokony ho nilaza na inona na inona izy
This one had.	ity iray ity dia nanana
Or questions.	na fanontaniana
There was no news of the incident.	tsy nisy ny vaovao momba ny zavamisy
But you can do that too.	azonao atao koa anefa izany
Don’t do too much, too fast.	aza manao be loatra haingana loatra
That’s how we are, often.	toy izany ny antsika matetika
He could not do it again.	tsy afaka nanao izany indray izy
He saw it.	nahita izany izy
There may have been.	mety nisy
It's still the same.	mbola izany ihany
Like, very unusual.	toy ny tena tsy mahazatra
The future seems uncertain.	toa tsy azo antoka ny ho avy
This is not a bad thing at all.	tsy zavatra ratsy tanteraka izany
There are more options for such.	misy safidy bebe kokoa aminny toy izany
Of course, there is a problem with that.	mazava ho azy fa misy olana aminizany
It was a great place.	tena toerana tsara ilay izy
He loves them too.	tia azy ireo koa izy
I might die.	mety ho maty aho
You are really dead.	maty marina ianao
He looks like a great man.	toa lehilahy lehibe izy
He lost everything.	very ny zavadrehetra izy
And he might have done it to more women.	ary mety ho nanao izany taminny vehivavy maro kokoa izy
There is nothing unusual there.	tsy misy tsy mahazatra any
Some go a step further.	misy manao dingana lavitra kokoa
They really need us.	tena mila antsika izy ireo
This, this and this.	ity ity ary ity
I was just wrong.	diso fotsiny aho
However, the results seem to be more complex.	na izany aza ny vokatra azo dia toa sarotra kokoa
I'm not far away now.	tsy lavitra aho izao
The real battle.	ny tena ady
But it was very good.	tena tsara anefa ilay izy
Maybe in the past.	taloha angamba
So there is a big reason.	noho izany dia misy antony lehibe
Both said they did not.	samy nilaza fa tsy nanao izany
People get what they deserve.	mahazo izay mendrika azy ny olona
But most of all, he hopes.	fa indrindra indrindra dia manantena izy
Yes, no bad news.	eny tsy misy vaovao ratsy
And he might like it too.	ary mety ho tiany koa izany
Of course, this is not always true.	mazava ho azy fa tsy marina foana izany
But don’t delay.	fa aza ela
I especially like to draw people.	tiako indrindra ny manao sary olona
After all, it went well.	raha ny zavadrehetra dia nandeha tsara izany
That seems to be the case now.	toa izay no misy azy ankehitriny
Maybe in a worse way than you.	angamba aminny fomba ratsy kokoa noho ianao
The real reason and why.	ny tena antony sy ny antony
So each one.	ka ny tsirairay avy
He never found a job.	tsy nahita asa mihitsy izy
It is no longer a matter of choice.	tsy resaka safidy intsony izany
Yes, he knows these people.	eny fantany ireo olona ireo
You there.	eo ianao
He doesn’t do anything special.	tsy manao na inona na inona manokana izy
He walked as usual.	nandeha toy ny mahazatra izy
The latter is the real problem for me.	ity farany no tena olana amiko
On this question.	aminity fanontaniana ity
I think they are really bad in the end.	heveriko fa tena ratsy izy ireo aminny farany
But not to him.	fa tsy aminy
He has never come to me.	mbola tsy tonga tany amiko mihitsy izy
He is the world to me.	izy no izao tontolo izao amiko
Even if it’s small.	na dia kely aza izany
A new day is coming.	ho avy ny andro vaovao
They still don’t.	mbola tsy manao izany izy ireo
We have to do it more often.	tsy maintsy manao izany matetika kokoa isika
So they have a job.	noho izany dia manana asa iray izy ireo
With that.	miaraka aminizany
And yes, they are gone.	ary eny lasa izy ireo
No two nights are the same.	tsy misy roa alina mitovy
A lot of people did.	betsaka ny olona nanao izany
He was a man who must have had a reason.	lehilahy tsy maintsy nanana antony izy
We all have to act like nothing happened.	tsy maintsy manao toy ny tsy nisy na inona na inona isika rehetra
But time passed quickly.	nandeha haingana anefa ny fotoana
Without action, it doesn’t go well.	raha tsy misy hetsika dia tsy mandeha tsara
But the method is completely different.	fa ny fomba dia samy hafa tanteraka
And he could have done it.	ary afaka nanao izany izy
Same for everyone.	mitovy aminny rehetra
Of course, this is very wrong.	mazava ho azy fa tena diso izany
He didn’t need bad news anymore, not now.	tsy nila vaovao ratsy intsony izy tsy izao
It’s just an impossible task.	asa tsy azo atao fotsiny izany
No one is here, he said.	tsy misy olona eto hoy izy
No one even needs to see you.	tsy misy olona mila mahita anao akory
And he was good enough.	ary ampy tsara izy
Sometimes for food, but not always.	indraindray ho anny sakafo fa tsy foana
Nothing was done at all.	tsy nisy natao mihitsy
I think it came from the people who were there.	heveriko fa avy aminny olona izay teo
About stupid work.	momba ny asa adala
But the way.	fa ny lalana
And the first job.	ary ny asa voalohany indrindra
But not in a bad way.	tsy aminny fomba ratsy anefa
It’s one of the best.	iray aminireo tsara indrindra izy io
He’s been in the game for a long time.	efa ela izy no tao aminny lalao
The house is full of them now.	feno azy ireo ny trano aminizao fotoana izao
There is also history today.	misy koa ny tantara ankehitriny
But there are too many choices and things.	saingy be loatra ny safidy sy ny zavatra
Both had to go.	tsy maintsy nandeha ireo roa ireo
And he is.	ary izy dia
He likes the best.	ny tsara indrindra no tiany
There were no women there.	tsy nisy vehivavy tao
It finally came to him.	tonga taminy ihany izany
But of course, women, not men, see it.	saingy mazava ho azy fa ny vehivavy fa tsy ny lehilahy no mahita izany
They look around.	mijery manodidina izy ireo
The future, now.	ny ho avy ankehitriny
From top to bottom.	avy any ambony ka hatrany ambany
Whether he likes it or not.	na tiany na tsia
So it came close to home.	noho izany dia tonga akaiky ny trano
Not too close.	tsy akaiky loatra
This is also very true.	tena misy marina ihany koa izany
These are very important.	zavadehibe tokoa ireo
But no one had died before.	tsy nisy maty teo aloha anefa na dia iray aza
They may do it, they may not do it.	mety hanao izany izy ireo mety tsy hanao izany
It was a wonderful night.	nahafinaritra ilay alina
But this could be for a number of reasons.	mety ho noho ny antony maro anefa izany
Either way, it looks fun.	na izany na tsy izany dia toa mahafinaritra
I know women better now.	fantatro tsara kokoa ny vehivavy ankehitriny
There was nothing we could do.	tsy nisy azo natao izahay
Both are together now.	samy miaraka izao
No more than it is now.	tsy mihoatra noho ny aminizao fotoana izao
Of course, you didn’t have it when you were younger.	mazava ho azy fa tsy mbola nanana izany ianao taminny mbola kely
He was just fast.	haingana fotsiny izy
Yes, in fact.	eny raha ny marina
It’s far too low.	tena ambany lavitra izany
There is no better or worse path than another.	tsy misy lalana tsara kokoa na ratsy kokoa noho ny iray hafa
This problem seemed difficult to me.	toa sarotra tamiko io olana io
It’s always been really fun.	tena nahafinaritra foana izany
It's yours.	anao izany
There was no action, however.	tsy nisy hetsika anefa
Pretty much nothing at all.	somary tsy nisy ny zavadrehetra
We need more food.	mila sakafo bebe kokoa isika
Yes and it could be.	eny ary mety ho izany
So, something like that.	noho izany ny zavatra toy izany
This is the most common option.	io no safidy mahazatra indrindra
They love this thing.	tia anio zavatra io izy ireo
Yes, you should know.	eny tokony ho fantatrao
There was none.	tsy nisy na iray aza
He had never been like that before.	mbola tsy toy izany mihitsy izy taloha
I can still work.	mbola afaka miasa aho
No, not the first.	tsia tsy ny voalohany
The house is easily accessible.	mora azo ny trano mora azo
So it’s a little harder.	noho izany dia somary sarotra kokoa
Which is not a big deal.	izay tsy zavatra lehibe
But she is also beautiful.	tsara tarehy koa anefa izy
Maybe you did too.	angamba ianao nanao izany koa
That was the fun part, he thought.	io no ampahany nahafinaritra hoy izy nieritreritra
However, there is another way.	na izany aza misy fomba iray hafa
You will not come.	tsy ho avy ianao
I have seen this place before.	efa nahita anio toerana io aho taloha
Good as before.	tsara toy ny teo aloha
But these are always small things.	saingy zavatra kely foana ireo
It seems like a different kind of place.	toa karazana toerana hafa izany
You will not do the same.	tsy hanao izany koa ianao
Yes, it is different for each person.	eny samy hafa ho anny olona tsirairay izany
Of course, this is completely wrong.	mazava ho azy fa diso tanteraka izany
I’ve seen this kind of thing before.	efa nahita anio karazana zavatra io aho taloha
And when you did, you thought about it.	ary rehefa nanao izany ianao dia nieritreritra azy
I’ve always had that.	efa nahazo anio foana aho
He had seen it all before.	efa nahita izany rehetra izany izy taloha
It’s hard to imagine what it could be.	sarotra ny nieritreritra hoe inona no mety ho izy
Or both together.	na izy roa miaraka
And it will be easier.	ary ho mora kokoa izany
And he went away.	ary lasa lavitra izy
People go often.	mandeha matetika ny olona
But he knew the truth.	fantany anefa ny marina
There was already a place for him now.	efa nisy toerana ho azy izao
Not at all true.	tsy marina mihitsy
But one part doesn’t work.	saingy tsy mandeha ny ampahany iray
I saw you looking at me.	hitako nijery ahy ianao
Some of them are hard to find, others easy.	ny sasany aminizy ireo dia sarotra hita ny hafa mora
Everything is for him as it should be.	ny zavadrehetra dia ho azy araka ny tokony ho izy
There may be enough time.	mety ho ampy ny fotoana
There had to be something.	tsy maintsy nisy zavatra
I had to start all over again.	tsy maintsy nanomboka indray aho
The final battle between good and evil.	ny ady farany aminny tsara aminny ratsy
It just can’t do it.	tsy afaka manao izany fotsiny
We were free and it was really fun.	afaka izahay ary tena mahafinaritra izany
I still love you.	mbola tiako ianao
Take a good look at what you like.	jereo tsara izay tianao
A woman, alone.	vehivavy iray irery
And there were only a few things.	ary nisy zavatra kely fotsiny
However, many may just do it.	na izany aza dia maro no mety hanao izany fotsiny
We will, we can, we must.	hanao isika afaka tsy maintsy
They seem to work well.	toa miasa tsara izy ireo
I don't know you anymore.	tsy fantatro intsony ianao
I don't need much.	tsy mila zavatra betsaka aho
We can do better.	afaka manao zavatra tsara kokoa isika
He is here.	eto izy
That's a problem.	olana io
He will come often.	ho avy matetika izy
Not this year, of course.	tsy aminity taona ity mazava ho azy
But you’re not too bad.	saingy tsy dia ratsy loatra ianao
People of others.	olona anny hafa
Or worst of all.	na ny ratsy indrindra
Or maybe safer.	na angamba azo antoka kokoa
But the other man was quick.	haingana anefa ilay lehilahy iray hafa
Or both do !.	na samy manao
I’ve traveled a long way, ever since.	nandeha lavitra aho nanomboka teo
Not a problem, apparently.	tsy olana toa
Maybe now is the time.	angamba izao no fotoana
However, all is well.	na izany aza tsara ny zavadrehetra
I did nothing to him.	tsy nanao na inona na inona taminy aho
It should be easy to find.	tokony ho mora hita izany
Something he likes.	zavatra tiany
And right away.	ary eo no eo
There is always.	misy foana
Or something similar.	na izay mitovy aminy
I have never seen so much.	tsy mbola nahita be toy izany aho
Two of them, in fact.	ny roa aminizy ireo raha ny marina
One of my favorites.	iray aminireo tiako tokoa
You have to do either one.	tsy maintsy manao na iray na iray ianao
And all his too.	ary ny azy rehetra koa
Loss of privacy.	very ny fiainana manokana
Now, it has started again.	ankehitriny nanomboka indray izany
Yes, we found a house.	eny nahita trano izahay
I really like it when someone does that.	tena tiako raha misy olona manao izany
It’s really easy to do when you know.	tena mora ny manao izany rehefa fantatrao
It’s everything.	zavatra rehetra izany
I don't need a problem here.	tsy mila olana eto aho
Others are stupid things.	ny hafa dia zavatra adala
But they are doing it right.	manao izany araka ny tokony ho izy anefa izy ireo
And he stood still.	ary mbola nijanona izy
Maybe more.	mety ho bebe kokoa
They don’t even know it yet.	mbola tsy fantany akory izany
They will not know.	tsy ho fantany
You die inside.	maty ianao ao anatiny
This story is very real.	tena misy tokoa io tantara io
We really started thinking about it.	tena nanomboka nieritreritra izany izahay
That kind of.	ny karazana izay
That’s what he knows so well.	izany no zavatra fantany tsara
In fact, they don’t seem happy to see me.	raha ny marina dia toa tsy faly mahita ahy izy ireo
Sometimes there is no discussion at all.	tsy misy resaka mihitsy indraindray
He never lost his words.	tsy very teny mihitsy izy
i really do.	tena manao aho
Then it was all over.	dia lasa izany rehetra izany
We love the story.	tia ny tantara izahay
Yes, you are in the right place.	eny eo aminny toerana mety ianao
There could be more.	mety ho betsaka kokoa
But as before.	fa toy ny efa nisy
But it’s been many years now.	saingy efa taona maro lasa izay izao
We make news.	manao vaovao izahay
It really is a job.	asa tokoa io
I take another step, then another.	manao dingana hafa aho avy eo hafa
Of course, he was happy with it all.	mazava ho azy fa faly taminizany rehetra izany izy
People had such a life.	nanana fiainana toy izany ny olona
It goes, that is.	mandeha izany izay
They just watched.	nijery fotsiny izy ireo
Now, we are very alone.	ankehitriny tena irery izahay
However, in reality, the two methods are very different.	na izany aza raha ny marina ny fomba roa dia tena samy hafa
A place can become very fast.	ny toerana iray dia mety ho lasa haingana be
I’m glad you like the idea.	faly aho fa tianao ilay hevitra
It doesn’t seem like much, and it isn’t.	toa tsy dia be loatra izany ary tsy izany
It’s different, too.	hafa ihany koa izany
And it is very important.	ary tena ilaina izany
Women never seemed to exist.	toa tsy nisy mihitsy ny vehivavy
And maybe you die here or maybe you don’t die.	ary angamba ianao maty eto na mety tsy maty
He did not say that.	tsy nilaza izany izy
Not too good, but you can.	tsy dia tsara loatra fa afaka
And about that, of course, is true.	ary ny momba izany mazava ho azy dia marina
Everything works well there.	miasa tsara daholo ny ao
Because that’s not the only life.	satria tsy izany fotsiny no fiainana
Yes there is that part.	eny misy izany ampahany izany
To be well aware of it.	mba ho fantany tsara izany
There were two problems with that.	nisy olana roa taminizany
A woman looked at the men.	nisy vehivavy nijery ireo lehilahy
You can't go there.	tsy afaka mandeha any ianao
We were a bit unsure.	somary tsy nahazo antoka izahay
Also, he has the words.	ary koa manana ny teny izy
But it was meant to be a fun day.	natao ho andro mahafinaritra anefa izany
The first of the two methods is the story method.	ny voalohany aminireo fomba roa dia ny fomba tantara
It can’t be done of course.	tsy azo atao mazava ho azy
That’s true, but it doesn’t make sense.	marina izany saingy tsy misy dikany
It just makes sense.	misy dikany ihany izany
Some are not true.	ny sasany tsy marina
They all have to be the same.	tsy maintsy mitovy daholo
They have nothing to do with me.	tsy manana na inona na inona amiko izy ireo
Ideally, this is what works.	raha ny tokony ho izy dia io no miasa
The other is bigger.	ny iray hafa dia lehibe kokoa
It makes sense like everything else.	misy dikany toy ny zavatra hafa rehetra
These are not simple facts.	tsy zavamisy tsotra ireo
So you have it.	ka manana izany ianao
He got a job there.	nahazo asa tany izy
I could be completely lost.	mety ho very tanteraka aho
Then there is no more.	dia tsy misy intsony
And he looked at the ground.	dia nijery ny tany izy
Here it is.	eto no misy azy
But it is new.	fa vaovao io
Always for him.	ho azy foana
What is the least common.	inona no kely indrindra mahazatra
Others are more difficult.	ny hafa dia sarotra kokoa
He is happy too.	faly koa izy
But that may not be the case either.	mety tsy ho izany koa anefa
We became like everyone else.	lasa toy ny hafa izahay
There were people.	nisy olona
One of the biggest, in fact.	iray aminireo lehibe indrindra raha ny marina
People may need to lose their jobs.	mety mila very asa ny olona
But that would be too bad.	ho ratsy loatra anefa izany
You need to watch.	mila mijery ianao
We must now begin the fight against these issues.	tsy maintsy manomboka ny ady aminireo olana ireo isika izao
Or something else.	na nisy zavatra hafa
Really good job there.	tena asa tsara any
The road is bad.	ratsy ny lalana
Now things are different.	ankehitriny dia hafa ny zavatra
So of course it’s a personal idea.	koa mazava ho azy fa hevitra manokana
Really free.	tena afaka
It went hard.	nandeha mafy izy io
I have to work too.	tsy maintsy miasa koa aho
They always had good food.	nanana sakafo tsara foana izy ireo
He seems lost, but we are all.	toa very izy fa isika rehetra
However, it is not.	na izany aza tsy izany
But everyone is different.	samy hafa anefa ny tsirairay
They often die.	matetika izy ireo no maty
Then we lost.	dia very izahay
Yes, not everything.	eny tsy ny zavadrehetra
He is only one man.	lehilahy iray ihany izy
He was once, completely.	izy indray mandeha tanteraka
Some people go to the wrong house, of course or not.	misy olona mandeha any aminny trano tsy mety mazava ho azy na tsia
Not so with me.	tsy mba toy izany ny ahy
And lost in thought.	ary very hevitra
He looked at me, and then looked again.	nijery ahy izy ary nijery indray
I drew.	nanao sary aho
Then they never came.	dia tsy tonga mihitsy izy ireo
You are not good.	tsy tsara ianao
In some ways we have to get that person.	aminny fomba sasany dia tsy maintsy mahazo anio olona io isika
Do it over and over again.	ataovy hatrany hatrany izany
Mine is bad.	ny ahy dia ratsy
Faces are different.	samy hafa ny tarehy
There was none of that.	tsy nisy izany rehetra izany
However, the present time is much easier.	na izany aza ny fotoana ankehitriny dia mora kokoa
It was as if he had already done so.	toy ny hoe efa nanao izany izy
We are starting a new era.	manomboka fotoana vaovao isika
He is all that and many more.	izy no izany rehetra izany sy ny maro hafa
Maybe it would be better if he didn’t come.	angamba tsara kokoa raha tsy tonga izy
He may have done it.	mety ho izy no nanao izany
I loved all that time.	tiako ny fotoana rehetra taminizany
Other types.	karazana hafa
We are wrong.	diso isika
And, in fact, you can’t.	ary raha ny marina dia tsy afaka
But the story is not hard to understand.	tsy sarotra anefa ny mahazo ilay tantara
It doesn’t seem too big.	toa tsy dia lehibe loatra
But the first possibility is the important thing.	fa ny mety ho voalohany dia ny zavadehibe
If someone doesn’t need you, they don’t need you.	raha tsy mila anao ny olona iray dia tsy mila anao izy
He already knew.	efa fantany
We had nothing else.	tsy nanana zavatra hafa izahay
I never looked at another man.	tsy nijery lehilahy hafa mihitsy aho
Not wrong, even to me.	tsy diso na dia amiko
I love him so much.	tiako loatra izy
It’s easier to be around me.	tsotra kokoa ny manodidina ahy
But nothing works.	saingy tsy misy miasa
You are very happy.	tena faly ianao
I know you are there.	fantatro fa ao ianao
We went crazy.	lasa adala izahay
They have always been there.	efa nisy foana izy ireo
He told me he needed the money.	nilaza tamiko izy fa mila ilay vola
He should have thought about it at first.	tokony ho nieritreritra momba azy izy taminny voalohany
The world deserves a better life.	mendrika ny tsara kokoa izao tontolo izao
All that money should not be lost.	tsy tokony ho very daholo izany vola izany
Maybe more than once.	mety mihoatra ny indray mandeha
These are, in general, internal.	ireo dia aminny ankapobeny anatiny
But then he was wrong.	taminizany anefa dia diso hevitra izy
He must come too.	tsy maintsy ho avy koa izy
This one isn't too big.	tsy dia lehibe loatra ity iray ity
But hope so too.	fa manantena ihany koa
There was no past, no future.	tsy nisy lasa tsy nisy ho avy
We have a lot of time.	manana fotoana betsaka isika
This option works well.	io safidy io dia miasa tsara
They seem to work.	toa miasa izy ireo
It’s really fun to have it around the house.	tena mahafinaritra ny manana azy manodidina ny trano
There are three options.	misy safidy telo
But this is the last time for them.	fa izany no fotoana farany ho azy ireo

And in two days, nothing at all.	ary aminny roa andro tsy misy mihitsy
They are very easy to make and also very fun.	tena mora ny manao azy ireo ary tena mahafinaritra ihany koa

It went fast and well.	nandeha haingana sy tsara izy io
But there were many problems.	nisy olana maro anefa
And they need you, you know that.	ary mila anao izy ireo fantatrao izany
Then they became confused.	dia lasa very hevitra izy ireo
We are different, but the same.	samy hafa isika saingy mitovy
But it’s still something.	saingy mbola zavatra ihany izany
When we need something, we follow it right away.	rehefa mila zavatra isika dia manaraka izany avy hatrany

You are always full of life.	feno fiainana foana ianao
I’m so glad you did.	tena faly aho fa nanao izany ianao
He said it was his own.	nilaza izy fa avy aminny tenany izany
They both looked that way.	samy nijery anio lalana io izy ireo
There is no question about that.	tsy misy fanontaniana momba anio
Then, he didn’t do much work either.	avy eo tsy nanao asa be koa izy

People just don’t look at it.	tsy mijery izany fotsiny ny olona
I actually enjoyed these.	nahafinaritra ahy ireo raha ny marina

Because if he does.	satria raha manao izany izy
There really was no easy way to say that.	tena tsy nisy fomba mora nilaza izany
I think other people will be the same.	heveriko fa ho toy izany koa ny olona hafa
I think that’s more than enough.	heveriko fa mihoatra noho ny ampy izany
That may be pointless.	izany dia mety ho tsy misy dikany
It’s not about the past.	tsy momba ny lasa izany
But not the old world.	saingy tsy izao tontolo izao taloha
I don’t need to look at a lot of people.	tsy mila mijery olona maro aho

Made them right away.	nanao azy ireo avy hatrany

This is the good life.	izany no fiainana tsara
Of course they are.	mazava ho azy fa izy ireo

I need to do it in the simplest way.	mila manao izany aminny fomba tsotra indrindra aho

A lot has come and gone.	be dia be no tonga sy lasa
There were many.	nisy betsaka
So good if possible.	ka tsara raha azo atao
But he does not follow.	fa tsy manaraka izy
But there are other options.	saingy misy safidy hafa
This will often not be true.	tsy ho marina izany matetika
When we got there, however, we saw nothing.	rehefa tonga any anefa izahay dia tsy mahita na inona na inona
So it’s almost instantaneous.	noho izany dia efa ho eo no ho eo
Because he loves.	satria tia
That is, yes, it is entirely possible.	izany hoe eny azo atao tanteraka izany
None of these, in fact, are my type.	tsy misy aminireo raha ny marina no karazana ahy
If you are, you are.	raha ianao dia ianao
Otherwise it is a very difficult task.	raha tsy izany dia asa sarotra be
But they are foolish.	adala anefa izy ireo
This one did both.	ity iray ity dia samy nanao azy roa

This is great news.	vaovao lehibe tokoa izany
I like being with you.	tiako ny miaraka aminao

It was coming, he knew.	ho avy izany fantany
It could even be a game.	mety ho lalao mihitsy aza
That is obvious.	mazava loatra izany
I never did that, you know.	tsy nanao izany mihitsy aho fantatrao
I think he was wrong there.	heveriko fa diso izy teo
He could not look at such a job now.	tsy afaka nijery asa toy izany izy izao
Either way, it seems like the right choice.	na izany na tsy izany toa izany no safidy mety
Because that’s not really the case.	satria tsy izany no tena izy

Like, very early.	toy ny aloha be

Good idea for a guy like me.	hevitra tsara ho anny lehilahy toa ahy
The product just needs space.	mila toerana fotsiny ny vokatra
But these are really fun.	tena mahafinaritra anefa ireo
It all starts somewhere.	manomboka any ho any ny rehetra
It's not bad at all.	tsy ratsy mihitsy ilay izy
The choice is entirely yours.	anao tanteraka ny safidy
But certainly for other simple tasks.	fa azo antoka fa ho anny asa tsotra hafa
And again, this is very different from the real world.	ary indray ity dia tena hafa noho ny tontolo tena izy
Both are wrong, in fact.	samy diso raha ny marina
However, it does not work.	na izany aza tsy miasa
It’s really not much of a story.	tena tsy dia tantara loatra ilay izy
No one looked at the place.	tsy nisy nijery ny toerana
Sometimes, life is more than work.	indraindray betsaka kokoa ny fiainana noho ny asa

It won’t make sense, of course.	tsy hisy dikany izany mazava ho azy
It could be you.	mety ho anao
It’s hard to be sure.	sarotra ny mahazo antoka
But they are very different.	samy hafa be anefa izy ireo
Not that way.	tsia izay lalana
But that is not true.	tsy tena izany anefa
Thanks for looking into the issues.	misaotra nijery ireo olana
But then he did the same.	saingy avy eo dia nanao toy izany koa izy
Even the little ones do it.	na ny kely aza dia manao izany
They look at the ground.	mijery ny tany izy ireo
No work is too big, no work is too small.	tsy misy asa lehibe loatra tsy misy asa kely loatra
He could have said that.	afaka nilaza izany izy
Come very close.	tonga tena akaiky
Everything was new to me.	vaovao tamiko ny rehetra
It’s hard to see why.	sarotra ny mahita antony
And see what happened to him.	ary jereo izay nahazo azy
The food there is very good.	tena tsara ny sakafo any
There are better options.	misy safidy tsara kokoa
More space is often needed.	matetika no ilaina toerana bebe kokoa
Something is wrong, you know.	misy zavatra ratsy fantatrao
But it is still bad.	mbola ratsy ihany anefa izany
He should be easy to find.	tokony ho mora hita izy
When you are like this.	rehefa toy izao ianao
I have a lot of money.	manana vola be aho
Words are important.	zavadehibe ny teny
I have a great job.	manana asa lehibe aho
Not as good as a car.	tsy tsara toy ny fiara
We all acted stupid.	samy nanao adala daholo izahay
It doesn’t make sense anymore.	tsy misy dikany intsony izany
Look at these.	jereo ireo
This is one of those jobs.	io no iray aminireo asa ireo
It’s very simple, and there seems to be nothing missing.	tsotra be ilay izy ary toa tsy misy tsy ampy
I've seen him do that before.	efa nahita azy nanao izany aho taloha
I looked too.	nijery koa aho
I finally see it now.	hitako ihany izao
I will not do such a thing.	tsy hanao zavatra toy izany aho
No need to thank us.	tsy mila misaotra anay
It is hard and small.	mafy sy kely izy io
But all of this seems pointless now.	toa tsy nisy dikany anefa izany rehetra izany ankehitriny
Take a good look at the world.	jereo tsara izao tontolo izao
This is because he knows the man.	izany dia satria fantany ilay lehilahy
I'm not happy.	tsy faly aho
It couldn’t be worse.	tsy mety ho ratsy kokoa
At the moment, that doesn’t seem to make sense.	aminizao fotoana izao dia toa tsy misy dikany izany
There will be war.	hisy ny ady
However, I would have seen you.	na izany aza dia ho nahita anao aho
He seemed to think the same way.	toa nieritreritra toy izany koa izy
So thanks !.	koa misaotra
And now, this is the first picture.	ary ankehitriny io no sary voalohany
One good, one bad.	ny iray tsara ny iray ratsy
Maybe for fun.	angamba mba ho mahafinaritra
And then, one final step.	ary avy eo dingana farany
I had to think a little.	tsy maintsy nieritreritra kely aho
Check out some of the products.	jereo ny vokatra sasany
No reason, no way.	tsy misy antony tsy misy fomba
He is very important to many.	tena zavadehibe ho anny maro tokoa izy
They are still us.	mbola isika ihany izy ireo
But he is great.	fa lehibe izy
He knows it, and he loves them for it.	fantany izany ary tiany izy ireo noho izany
It was right there, hard to miss.	teo mihitsy ilay izy sarotra tsy hita
I will definitely do more.	tena hanao zavatra bebe kokoa aho
No one likes him.	tsy misy olona tia azy
But no one seemed to have a problem with that.	saingy toa tsy nisy nanana olana taminizany
But that doesn't suit him.	tsy mety aminy anefa izany
But not both at the same time.	saingy tsy izy roa aminny fotoana iray ihany
You are the best.	ianao no tsara indrindra
It’s not good anymore.	tsy tsara intsony izany
I think we should do that.	heveriko fa tokony hanao izany isika
However, this only works.	na izany aza io ihany no miasa
He seemed happy to get there.	toa faly izy tonga teo
Others did it with less, and with less.	ny hafa dia nanao izany taminny kely kokoa ary taminny kely kokoa
You can look there.	afaka mijery any ianao
They have a reason.	misy antony izy ireo
They are not too bad.	tsy dia ratsy loatra izy ireo
The right time has come.	tonga ny fotoana mety
I love you, and you alone.	ianao no tiako ary ianao irery ihany
This is unusual for me.	tsy mahazatra ahy izany
Everything has to go somewhere.	tsy maintsy mandeha any ho any ny zavadrehetra
However, they are often able to do this job.	na izany aza matetika izy ireo no afaka manao izany asa izany
Then an idea came to him.	dia nisy hevitra tonga tao aminy
You can start easily or already.	afaka manomboka mora na efa misy ianao
I am very happy and happy too.	tena faly aho ary faly koa
I really like the food.	tena tiako ny sakafo
As it should be in life.	toy ny tokony ho eo aminny fiainana
This is usually low.	izany no matetika ambany
Got the money.	nahazo ny vola
That's the way the world is.	izany no fomba izao tontolo izao
The best is the small.	ny tsara indrindra dia ny kely
There is nothing more important than life in this world.	tsy misy zavadehibe kokoa noho ny fiainana eto aminizao tontolo izao
This one is more complicated.	sarotra kokoa ity iray ity
Fun and fun.	mahafinaritra sy mahafinaritra
They absolutely love you.	tia anao tanteraka izy ireo
We can do it as long as we are one.	afaka manao izany isika raha mbola iray ihany
That seemed like a lot of money to me.	toa vola be tamiko izany
You almost are.	saika ianao
Once he stopped.	indray mandeha izy dia nijanona
For all of us indeed.	ho antsika rehetra tokoa
It's just really bad.	tena ratsy ihany ilay izy
It is and should be more.	izy io ary tokony ho bebe kokoa
They don’t have it.	tsy manana izany izy ireo
Or something else.	na aminny zavatra hafa
I want the same for others, sometimes, and sometimes not.	toy izany koa no tiako ho anny hafa indraindray ary indraindray tsy
But of course, these two options are not the same.	saingy mazava ho azy fa tsy mitovy ireo safidy roa ireo
I hope you like this one.	manantena aho fa tianao ity iray ity
He has us.	manana antsika izy
It’s always easy.	mora foana izany
That's what he knew.	izay no fantany
Maybe it’s too hard about money.	mafy loatra angamba ny momba ny vola
But I'm not really happy about that.	tsy tena faly aminizany anefa aho
We both do it, and we can’t do it here.	samy manao izany isika ary tsy afaka manao izany eto
Often, the cause is not found.	matetika tsy hita ny antony
There were two major things to be seen.	nisy zavatra roa lehibe hita
But not in it.	fa tsy ao anatiny
But we don't have to.	tsy mila manao izany anefa isika
But he still loves it.	mbola tiany anefa izany
Which is always good.	izay tsara foana
And they are very different worlds.	ary tontolo tena samy hafa izy ireo
Evil is different.	hafa ny ratsy
But when he did, it seemed pointless.	saingy rehefa nanao izany izy dia toa tsy nisy dikany izany
They really had no choice.	tena tsy nanana safidy izy ireo
We both didn’t want to take the first step.	samy tsy te hanao ny dingana voalohany izahay
If he couldn't have it.	raha tsy afaka nanana izany izy
These men are different.	samy hafa ireo lehilahy ireo
For some, it may be so.	ho anny sasany dia mety ho toy izany
So there are all these things working here.	noho izany dia misy ireo zavatra rehetra ireo miasa eto
And then again and again.	ary avy eo hatrany hatrany
They are life itself.	izy ireo dia fiainana mihitsy
This war, however.	ity ady ity anefa
It’s hard or even difficult then.	sarotra na sarotra aza izany avy eo
This is a very difficult question.	tena fanontaniana sarotra izany
There are too many things they don’t know.	be loatra ny zavatra tsy fantany
Maybe something went wrong.	angamba nisy zavatra tsy nandeha tsara
Same as them here.	mitovy aminizy ireo eto
Almost no one did.	saika tsy nisy nanao izany
Maybe both of these things are true.	angamba samy marina ireo zavatra ireo
You are everything.	izao rehetra izao ianao
But it can be whatever you want.	mety ho izay tianao anefa izany
Yes, not only that.	eny tsy izany fotsiny
They did.	nanao izy ireo
And that has become the norm.	ary izany no lasa fomba
This part is appropriate.	ity ampahany ity dia mety
This is a small idea with great results.	hevitra kely misy vokatra lehibe ity
It's like this.	toy izao izany
You can only have a bad day.	afaka andro ratsy fotsiny ianao
very good picture.	sary tena tsara
This is one.	ity dia iray
We haven’t had that since.	tsy nanana izany mihitsy izahay nanomboka teo
This thing goes, and they can have it.	mandeha ity zavatra ity ary afaka manana izany izy ireo
This one does just that.	ity iray ity ihany no manao izany
Bad place.	toerana ratsy
He is too far away from that.	lavitra loatra izy noho izany
Most of them are better.	ny betsaka aminizy ireo no tsara kokoa
He did not want to be alone.	tsy te ho irery izy
It’s all clear.	mazava daholo izany
And there are simple games.	ary misy lalao tsotra
It’s hard to do that in general.	sarotra ny manao izany aminny ankapobeny
Men generally do a good job of it.	aminny ankapobeny dia manao asa tsara aminizany ny lehilahy
Although he did not.	na dia tsy nanao izany aza izy
You don’t know you’re doing it.	tsy fantatrao fa manao izany ianao
And the person may be free.	ary mety ho afaka ilay olona
This is very clear.	izany dia mazava tsara
But there are also important people.	misy olona ambony koa anefa
Then the process begins again.	dia manomboka indray ny dingana
Everything was so simple and easy back then.	tsotra sy mora tokoa ny zavadrehetra taminizany
That’s a lot more than it should be.	be noho ny tokony ho izy izany
We are very strong.	tena mafy be izahay
She is very beautiful and very happy.	tena tsara tarehy izy ary tena faly
These two words.	ireo teny roa ireo
And the same question remains.	ary mbola misy fanontaniana mitovy
It could be closer.	mety ho akaiky kokoa izany
You don’t know anything about me.	tsy fantatrao na inona na inona momba ahy
I enjoyed everyone.	nahafinaritra ahy ny tsirairay
He is very right.	tena marina tokoa izy
To her, she was the most beautiful woman.	ho azy dia izy no vehivavy tsara tarehy indrindra
Because they are stupid, in every way possible.	satria adala izy ireo aminny fomba rehetra azo atao
They started right away.	nanomboka teo no ho eo izy ireo
Anything and everything.	na inona na inona sy ny zavadrehetra
This is not yet complete.	mbola tsy tanteraka izany
He was often the first there.	matetika izy no voalohany tao
But more is missing.	mbola betsaka kokoa anefa ny zavatra tsy hita
But he is a very handsome man.	tena lehilahy tsara tarehy anefa izy
He was a great man.	lehilahy lehibe izy
that's it.	dia izay
One time may be enough.	mety ho ampy ny fotoana iray
It is a common place, and often without houses.	toerana mahazatra izy io ary matetika tsy misy trano
I love that part of the game.	tiako io ampahany aminny lalao io
However, the process is not like that.	na izany aza tsy toy izany ny dingana
No one could ever say.	tsy nisy afaka nilaza mihitsy
Remained small and special.	nijanona ho kely sy manokana
He should have known where he was.	tokony ho fantany ny nisy azy
And these people.	ary ireo olona ireo
Look, there will be more.	jereo mbola hisy bebe kokoa
It is and I really want to do it.	izy io ary tena te hanao izany
They are just things.	zavatra ihany izy ireo
We have to start anew.	tsy maintsy manomboka vaovao isika
The women were not there.	tsy tany ny vehivavy
The problem is, it’s true.	ny olana dia marina izany
I think that’s just the next step for me.	heveriko fa izay ihany no dingana manaraka ho ahy
Maybe one day, but not now.	indray andro angamba fa tsy izao
As a result.	raha ny vokatra
I love having it.	tiako ny manana izany
You don't know him.	tsy fantatrao izy
That’s probably the real reason.	izany angamba no tena antony
This is a real problem for me.	tena olana amiko izany
It doesn’t matter at all.	tsy zavadehibe mihitsy
It's all bad news.	vaovao ratsy daholo
With the bad, it’s a different story.	miaraka aminny ratsy tantara hafa izany
I think you will know.	heveriko fa ho fantatrao
No one comes here anymore.	tsy misy olona tonga eto intsony
Not looking at him.	tsy mijery azy
And a lot of people do.	ary maro ny olona manao izany
But it must be done now.	saingy tsy maintsy atao izany aminizao fotoana izao
He will be here anytime now.	ho tonga eto izy aminny fotoana rehetra izao
Although these may not be true.	na dia mety tsy marina aza ireo
You may be lost.	mety ho very ianao
Many more came.	tonga ny maro hafa
It should be easy.	tokony ho mora izany
Said something about.	nilaza zavatra momba ny
Then it went, too.	dia lasa koa izany
I have a small job.	asa kely aho
I could be completely wrong about that.	mety ho diso hevitra tanteraka aho momba izany
With that we are here.	miaraka aminizany isika eto
A clear year is a time.	ny taona mazava dia fotoana iray
There is nothing here for you.	tsy misy na inona na inona eto ho anao
That's where he wants to be.	ao no tiany hisy
I will be a completely different person with you.	ho olona hafa mihitsy aho miaraka aminao
It seems to be for everyone.	toa ho anny rehetra izany
That’s where you want to be.	any no tianao hisy
And that’s normal.	ary mahazatra izany
He never said what.	tsy nilaza mihitsy izy hoe inona
As at all times.	toy ny aminny fotoana rehetra
Of course, this is important in the routine.	mazava ho azy fa zavadehibe aminny mahazatra izany
I didn’t do anything worth it.	tsy nanao na inona na inona mendrika izany aho
we arrived at night.	alina vao tonga izahay
Both were not fun to think about.	samy tsy nahafinaritra ny nieritreritra
It’s a word, a lot of words.	teny izany teny maro be
Yes I said yes.	eny hoy aho aminizany
They will come here when they get here.	ho tonga eto izy ireo rehefa tonga eto
There are two.	misy roa
It will be good for now.	ho tsara izany aminizao fotoana izao
A small thing, at first.	zavatra kely taminny voalohany
Same thing.	mitovy ihany
Yes, they are not very pretty.	eny tsy dia tsara tarehy izy ireo
But if he is, he will do it.	fa raha izy no izy dia hanao izany izy
Now that’s not a bad idea.	ankehitriny dia tsy hevitra ratsy izany
It’s all around the place.	manodidina ny toerana rehetra izany
In so many ways.	aminny fomba maro dia maro
This one has a similar problem.	ity dia manana olana mitovy aminizany
You will be glad to come.	ho faly ianao tonga
I don't like it very much.	tsy tiako loatra
But it can do better than that.	afaka manao tsara kokoa noho izany anefa izany
Always this one.	foana ity iray ity
It doesn’t seem easy.	toa tsy mora izany
Yes, maybe both of them.	eny angamba izy roa ireo
And that could be the problem.	ary mety ho izany no olana
We should all do that.	tokony hanao izany isika rehetra
It's very fast and easy.	tena haingana sy mora izany
But maybe that doesn’t make sense.	fa angamba tsy hisy dikany izany
And it’s not the same for me.	ary tsy mitovy amiko izany
I didn’t have a single problem.	tsy nanana olana na dia iray aza aho
I hope you will be like that.	manantena aho fa ho toy izany ianao
This may not be possible.	mety tsy ho azo atao izany
You are still mine, all mine, no matter what.	mbola ho ahy ianao ahy rehetra na inona na inona
But it was not just once.	tsy indray mandeha ihany anefa ilay izy
Because there was no obvious problem, we did it.	satria tsy nisy olana mazava dia nanao izany izahay
That is where we are today.	izany no misy antsika ankehitriny
I saw nothing about him.	tsy nisy nahita ny momba azy aho
Then there was the most important thing.	avy eo dia nisy ny zavadehibe indrindra
The same is true.	toy izany koa ny zavamisy
Such a fool.	adala toy izany
Otherwise nothing.	raha tsy izany na inona na inona
I am from a very different place.	avy aminny toerana tena hafa aho
Still good overall.	mbola tsara aminny ankapobeny
It is still too early.	mbola aloha loatra izany
That is the best.	izay no tsara indrindra
But there was nothing before about it.	saingy tsy nisy na inona na inona teo aloha momba izany
Kind of becomes ugly.	karazana lasa ratsy tarehy
The woman is walking alone.	mandeha irery ilay vehivavy
They have to be a lot.	tsy maintsy be dia be izy ireo
I can easily find things.	mora mahita zavatra aho
There’s a little bit of everything here.	misy kely ny zavadrehetra eto
Maybe something else is wrong somewhere.	angamba misy zavatra hafa tsy mety any ho any
He is not free yet.	mbola tsy afaka taminizany izy
There was nothing more important now.	tsy nisy zavadehibe hafa izao
The current one is going well.	ny aminizao fotoana izao dia mandeha tsara
There are difficult choices to make.	misy safidy sarotra atao
They all saw him.	nahita azy izy rehetra
It’s hard to get them for no reason.	sarotra ny nahazo azy ireo tsy nisy antony
This is bad for obvious reasons.	ratsy izany noho ny antony mazava
Very easy to do.	tena mora atao
So, it’s not easy for men.	noho izany tsy mora ho anny lehilahy izany
It’s all too hard.	sarotra loatra izany rehetra izany
He is here now.	eo izy izao
And then he was still not dead.	ary avy eo dia mbola tsy maty izy
It seems like work.	toa asa izany
But don’t expect too much.	fa aza manantena be loatra
I see it better.	hitako tsara kokoa izany
Overall, good reason.	aminny ankapobeny antony tsara
But mine is different.	fa hafa ny ahy
They are here now.	eto izy ireo izao
He won't be long.	tsy ho ela izy
Very simple and fast.	tena tsotra sy haingana
But it is not as simple as it seems.	tsy tsotra araka ny hita anefa izany
So, men did better overall.	noho izany ny lehilahy dia nanao tsara kokoa aminny ankapobeny
Everything inside went hard.	nandeha mafy daholo ny tao anatiny
They seem to do the same.	toa manao izany koa izy ireo
Without work, there will be no results.	raha tsy misy ny asa dia tsy hisy vokatra
Like you need to.	toy ny hoe mila
He looks at me.	mijery ahy izy
He always does what is right.	manao ny marina foana izy
You know there are a lot of false stories.	fantatrao fa misy tantara tsy marina maro
Someone there.	olona iray any
He was all gone.	lasa daholo izy
Even he probably hasn’t.	na izy aza angamba tsy mbola
And then it’s like home.	ary avy eo dia toy ny trano
It's bad for him.	ratsy ho azy izany
We've had similar questions before.	efa nanana fanontaniana mitovy aminizany koa izahay taloha
The parts are good.	tsara ny ampahany
In fact, it’s more.	raha ny marina bebe kokoa izany
It all seemed to make sense.	toa nisy dikany daholo izany
Maybe they already had two.	angamba efa nanana roa izy ireo
It’s just not there.	tsy eo fotsiny izy io
This is probably the fastest option.	ity angamba no safidy haingana indrindra
It has to start all over again.	tsy maintsy manomboka indray izany
I already got a game.	efa nahazo lalao aho
That’s right, no.	marina izany tsy misy
I still need to see him.	mbola mila mahita azy aho
And now the thing is gone.	ary izao dia lasa ilay zavatra
All work is the same.	mitovy ny asa rehetra
It is very simple.	tsotra be izy io
They do the same thing but are completely different.	manao zavatra mitovy izy ireo fa samy hafa tanteraka
I could have thought much better.	afaka nieritreritra tsara lavitra aho
What age.	inona taona
There was even talk of war.	nisy resaka ady mihitsy aza
The truth is wrong.	ny tena marina diso lalana
They really enjoy the nightlife.	tena mahafinaritra ny fiainana alina izy ireo
Here is a better picture.	ity misy sary tsara kokoa
Not even close.	tsy akaiky akory
Like any other game.	toy ny lalao hafa rehetra
But you know what is real.	fantatrao anefa izay tena izy
We guys love it so much.	tia mafy izahay lehilahy
He loves both of them.	samy tiany izy roa
Of course, this is crazy.	mazava ho azy fa adala izany
He said it would not be good.	nilaza izy fa tsy ho tsara izany
And now you have seen it.	ary izao ianao nahita azy
When you get there you are alone.	rehefa tonga any ianao dia irery
But it may make sense.	mety misy dikany anefa izany
They are not the same for everyone.	tsy mitovy aminny rehetra izy ireo
Not so with these fools.	tsy toy izany koa ireo adala ireo
It needs to work.	mila miasa izany
Because it’s important.	satria zavadehibe izany
He had never needed it before.	mbola tsy nila izany mihitsy izy taloha
They look really good.	toa tena tsara izy ireo
There was no sure way he was wrong.	tsy nisy fomba azo antoka fa diso izy
He was like a normal man.	toy ny lehilahy mahazatra izy

I stopped early.	nijanona aloha aho
Real product, in fact.	vokatra marina raha ny marina
There’s a lot they don’t know.	be dia be ny tsy fantany

It doesn’t start an action in the game.	tsy manomboka hetsika aminny lalao izany
But, it’s important.	saingy zavadehibe
They haven't seen us yet.	mbola tsy nahita anay izy ireo
It’s not recent but I really like it.	tsy vao haingana izy io fa tena tiako indrindra
He must have thought about it.	tsy maintsy nieritreritra izany izy
This is not always done.	tsy atao foana izany
I love this thing, it goes well.	tiako ity zavatra ity mandeha tsara
Someone always needs you.	misy olona mila anao foana
We have to go beyond that.	tsy maintsy mihoatra izany isika
You, others like you.	ianao ny hafa toa anao
So what is right.	ka inona no mety
And the reason is obvious.	ary hita ny antony
They are just beautiful.	tsara tarehy fotsiny izy ireo
And that’s only one reason.	ary antony iray ihany izany
He enjoyed the night.	nahafinaritra azy ny alina
You follow us.	manaraka anay ianao
Of course it is very true.	mazava ho azy fa tena marina
It works.	mandeha izany
Look really good.	jereo tena tsara
Then it is for sure.	dia dia azo antoka izany

You really want to do your best work.	tena te hanao ny asa tsara indrindra ianao
The woman was not there.	tsy teo io vehivavy io
Yes, that will be enough.	eny ho ampy izany
Maybe there was still time.	mbola nisy fotoana angamba
Something completely different.	zavatra hafa tanteraka
That's all, of course.	izay ihany mazava ho azy
The truth is true even if no one does.	marina ny marina na dia tsy misy manao izany aza
But of course no one is there.	saingy mazava ho azy fa tsy misy olona ao
It is very beautiful and feminine.	tena tsara tarehy sy vehivavy izy io
He couldn't stop anymore.	tsy afaka nijanona intsony izy
I love everything below and everything.	tiako ny zavadrehetra eto ambany sy ny zavatra rehetra
Look at them all.	jereo izy rehetra
All in one place.	aminny toerana iray daholo
Looks like he could be good.	toy ny mety ho tsara izy
In fact, we had to do it.	raha ny marina dia tsy maintsy nanao izany izahay
This fight went fast, and there was nothing.	nandeha haingana io ady io ary tsy nisy na inona na inona
You didn't do anything worse than that.	tsy nanao ratsy noho izany ianao
Everything goes on time.	ny zavadrehetra dia mandeha aminny fotoana
No one else.	tsy nisy olona hafa
Everything seems possible now.	toa azo atao daholo izao
He wants everything for you.	tiany ho anao ny zavadrehetra
But in the end, it didn’t make sense.	saingy taminny farany dia tsy nisy dikany izany
A small world, he said.	tontolo kely hoy izy
It has always been there.	tena nisy foana io
Thanks for having fun, found.	misaotra fa nahafinaritra nahita
But three nights ago.	saingy telo alina lasa izay
But he did not think that he was just doing something.	tsy nieritreritra anefa izy fa nanao zavatra fotsiny
It may not be the same for two things that are the same.	mety tsy mitovy aminny zavatra roa mitovy
He will be happier.	ho faly kokoa izy
Even longer.	na ela kokoa aza
Bad times.	fotoana ratsy
Not as hard as it looks.	tsy mafy araka ny hita
Everything is too big.	lehibe loatra ny zavadrehetra
They both had to have a place there.	tsy maintsy nisy toerana tao izy roa
I think that is also very true.	heveriko fa tena zavamisy koa izany
Once upon a time things weren’t too bad.	indray mandeha aminny zavatra tsy dia ratsy loatra
Far from us.	lavitra antsika
That time may be just around the corner.	mety ho akaiky ihany izany fotoana izany
You could be wrong too.	mety ho diso koa ianao
Real people watching you.	ny tena olona mijery anao
You better understand the game that way.	azonao tsara kokoa ny lalao aminizany fomba izany
The situation may be very different.	mety ho hafa mihitsy ny zavamisy
They are simple tasks.	izy ireo dia asa tsotra
But it took some time to get there.	nila fotoana kely anefa vao tonga tany
There could be many reasons.	mety ho maro ny antony
It was easy for him to do so.	mora taminy ny nanao izany
It doesn’t.	tsy manao izany
Don't do the worst to me.	aza manao ny ratsy indrindra amiko
There is something better than nothing.	misy zavatra tsara kokoa noho ny tsy misy
He refuses to do that.	tsy mety manao izany izy
They are not always like that.	tsy mba toy izany foana izy ireo
They looked down, stopped.	nijery ambany izy ireo nijanona
Whether you do it or not.	na manao izany ianao na tsy manao izany
Work, work, that’s all he knows.	asa asa izay ihany no fantany
Did what you had to do.	nanao izay tokony ho azonao
You know you’re doing a wonderful job.	fantatrao fa manao asa mahafinaritra ianao
I looked away from him.	nijery lavitra azy aho
He had never done that before.	mbola tsy nanao izany mihitsy izy taloha
He was the first to tell me.	izy no voalohany nilaza tamiko
You never do.	tsy manao mihitsy ianao
It would not have happened at all.	dia tsy ho nisy izany rehetra izany
For me, that’s good.	ho ahy dia tsara izany
I have been thinking about this problem.	efa nieritreritra anio olana io aho
Or longer.	na ela kokoa
Lots of.	betsaka ny
The land is beautiful.	mahafinaritra ny tany
It’s also fast.	haingana ihany koa izany
Don’t go easy.	aza mandeha mora
These are not.	tsy ireo izany
If not, you have to.	raha tsy izany dia tsy maintsy
And it is also wrong.	ary diso koa izany
But much is lacking.	betsaka anefa ny tsy ampy
Lots of land.	betsaka ny tany
But there is nothing for him.	saingy tsy misy na inona na inona ho azy
And he was not wrong.	ary tsy diso izy
He had no argument.	tsy nanana ady hevitra izy
But he didn't say anything about it either.	saingy tsy nilaza na inona na inona momba izany koa izy
No more games.	tsy misy lalao intsony
Apparently they were free.	hita fa afaka izy ireo
There seemed to be no question.	toa tsy nisy fanontaniana
But there was nothing wrong with that.	tsy nisy diso anefa izany
It wasn’t the car that did it.	tsy ny fiara no nanao izany
But that is too far.	lavitra loatra anefa izany
You can do little things.	afaka manao zavatra kely ianao
But it could be important in other ways.	saingy mety ho zavadehibe aminny fomba hafa izany
They did something.	nanao zavatra izy ireo
Maybe for me.	angamba ho ahy
Or whatever he likes.	na izay tiany
He is himself.	izy dia ny tenany
It could be a feminine thing.	mety ho zavatra vehivavy izany
There is a lot of life like that.	be dia be ny fiainana toy izany
We did too.	nanao koa izahay
He may have gone crazy.	lasa adala angamba izy
There will be no discussion.	tsy hisy resaka
He is not his.	tsy azy izy
Very unusual.	tena tsy mahazatra
Please do that.	mba ataovy izay
You have come a long way.	tonga lavitra ianao
I don't even like it.	tsy tiako akory
Great for beginners.	tena tsara ho anny vao manomboka
Some people disagree with me on this.	misy olona tsy mitovy hevitra amiko momba izany
I love this house.	tiako io trano io
It should have been fun.	tokony ho nahafinaritra
It seems so close.	toa akaiky dia akaiky
But if there is anything you can do.	fa raha misy zavatra azonao atao
He finally arrived.	tonga ihany izy taminny farany
Everyone here loves you.	ny olona rehetra eto tianao
I'm starting to come again.	manomboka ho avy indray aho
I will do that next time.	hanao izany aho aminny manaraka
Food is food.	ny sakafo dia sakafo
It’s not too hard either.	tsy dia sarotra loatra koa izany
You will be a free man.	ho lehilahy afaka ianao
Then act again.	dia manao hetsika indray
The fact is there is nothing you can do.	ny zavamisy dia tsy misy na inona na inona azonao natao
Yes, I have one.	eny iray ny ahy
He was almost completely lost.	saika very tanteraka izy
But true.	fa marina
They have lost their reason.	very antony izy ireo
The hardest.	ny sarotra indrindra
They don’t find time.	tsy mahita fotoana izy ireo
These people are real.	tena misy ireo olona ireo
And of course, it seemed like that at first.	ary mazava ho azy fa toa izany izy taminny voalohany
There may still be a future.	mety mbola hisy ny ho avy
Of course, it can still be wrong.	mazava ho azy fa mbola mety diso
For real people.	ho anny tena olona
Some go, some don’t.	misy ny mandeha ny sasany tsy mandeha
Something is going on there.	misy zavatra mandeha any
Or maybe even better.	na mety tsara
I didn't look inside.	tsy nijery ny tao anatiny aho
I think they just follow us.	heveriko fa manaraka antsika fotsiny izy ireo
It’s faster for the most part.	haingana kokoa izany ho anny ampahany lehibe
You love them.	tia azy ireo ianao
For starters, he did well.	ho anny vao manomboka dia nanao tsara izy
The same is true here.	toy izany koa izao ny eto
Not at all, he said.	tsy izany mihitsy hoy izy
Do it, already.	ataovy izany efa
Or maybe, more than one thing.	na angamba zavatra mihoatra ny iray
It really should be like that.	tena tokony ho toy izany
Love the words.	tia ny teny
We don’t see reality.	tsy mahita zavamisy izahay
And when he was not there, he was there.	ary rehefa tsy teo izy dia teo izy
I can never.	tsy afaka mihitsy aho
He is the best of the best.	izy no tena tsara indrindra aminny tsara indrindra
He works fast on that.	miasa haingana aminizany izy
You want it to be better.	tianao ho tsara kokoa izany
It was a big country.	tany lehibe iray izy io
It won't be far.	tsy ho lavitra izany
It could be anything.	mety ho na inona na inona
This is a vague idea.	hevitra tsy mazava izany
He needs to see it.	mila mahita izany izy
But not, he thought.	tsy izany anefa hoy izy nieritreritra
This is a completely different problem.	olana hafa tanteraka ity
I think it has to be good.	heveriko fa tsy maintsy tsara izany
We have a similar path, if you will.	manana lalana mitovy aminizany isika raha tianao
The problem goes away.	mandeha ny olana
It was worse at first.	ratsy kokoa izany taminny voalohany
I am not human at all.	tsy olona mihitsy aho
It never goes well.	tsy mandeha tsara mihitsy
Or, to be honest, it is.	na ny marina izany
We didn’t think so.	tsy nieritreritra izany izahay
But whoever walks around comes.	fa izay mandeha manodidina dia tonga
There is more to it than meets the eye here.	misy zavatra mihoatra noho izay hita eto
Others start from more difficult places.	ny hafa dia manomboka aminny toerana sarotra kokoa
There are so many of them.	misy be dia be izany
He was almost insecure then.	saika tsy azo antoka izy avy eo
I should have seen this before.	tokony efa nahita anio aho taloha
This is good for you.	tsara ho anao izany
In fact, many people don’t.	raha ny marina maro ny olona tsy
It is very important to do so.	tena ilaina ny nanao izany
Nothing like this has ever happened to me.	tsy mbola nisy toy izany tamiko
It may not make sense.	mety ho tsy misy dikany izany
Closer than women.	akaiky kokoa noho ny vehivavy
He is someone you know where you are.	olona fantatrao ny toerana misy anao izy
That is the only option.	izay ihany no safidy
We are no longer together.	tsy miaraka intsony isika
Here, however, we have another problem.	eto anefa dia manana olana hafa isika
They both came that way.	samy tonga taminizany fomba izany izy ireo
At other times, it doesn’t.	aminny fotoana hafa tsy mety
A little hard.	mafy kely
I think that's clear.	heveriko fa mazava izany
So there is no such option.	ka tsy misy io safidy io
There were two problems in general.	nisy olana roa taminny ankapobeny
Yes, it has.	eny efa nisy izany
Then he got another one.	dia nahazo iray hafa izy
Nothing bad yet.	tsy mbola misy ratsy
Better time.	fotoana tsara kokoa
But that's all he wants.	fa izany ihany no tiany
It was as if he was free.	toy ny hoe afaka izy
In the right way.	aminny lalana marina
But that moment stayed with me.	nijanona tamiko anefa io fotoana io
And in general.	ary aminny ankapobeny
I think there has to be someone.	heveriko fa tsy maintsy misy olona iray
It’s the same with any game.	mitovy aminny lalao rehetra izany
I looked at the ground.	nijery ny tany aho
Either it dies or it goes away.	na maty izy io na mandeha
You never did anything.	tsy nanao na inona na inona mihitsy ianao
And he looked.	ary nijery izy
There is no life now.	tsy misy fiainana intsony izao
A little is always enough.	kely dia ampy foana
We simply follow.	manaraka tsotra izao izahay
It seems completely automatic.	toa mandeha ho azy tanteraka ilay izy
She loved that part of the day.	tiany io ampahany aminny andro io
Story after story.	tantara manaraka tantara
But it’s all too big a picture.	saingy sary lehibe loatra izany rehetra izany
He thought too much again.	nieritreritra be loatra indray izy
These are wrong.	diso ireo
Or, almost everyone.	na saika ny rehetra
Decent home.	trano mendrika
It never went well.	tsy nandeha tsara mihitsy ilay izy
To me this.	amiko ity
I had to do this for the picture.	tsy maintsy nanao izany ho anny sary aho
The place looks good.	toa tsara ilay toerana
It’s a little hard not to do that.	somary sarotra ny tsy manao izany
normal, you know.	mahazatra fantatrao
We can all be wrong.	samy mety diso daholo isika
This game had a good idea.	nanana hevitra tsara ity lalao ity
They come from afar to do so.	avy lavitra izy ireo mba hanao izany
And you were there alone.	ary teo ianao irery
Yes, you will.	eny hanao izany tokoa ianao
But the thing is.	fa ny zavatra dia
I'm glad to see him here again.	faly aho mahita azy eto indray
You can have it.	afaka manana izany ianao
But he is not happy.	tsy faly anefa izy
But it’s even lower.	saingy mbola ambany kokoa izany
And they were good men, all of them.	ary lehilahy tsara izy ireo izy rehetra
It was too much.	be loatra ilay izy
Now is the right time for war.	fotoana mety aminny ady izao
There is only one surefire way.	fomba iray ihany no azo antoka
No, that's really bad.	tsia tena ratsy izany
And it was really good.	ary tena tsara ilay izy
Look at the one there.	jereo ilay ao
He may be able to see at night.	mety ho afaka mahita izy aminny alina
You are easy.	mora ianao
He is not human, he said.	tsy olona izy hoy izy
Now there will be.	ankehitriny dia hisy
He needed to see her.	nila nahita azy izy
I think we weren’t used to it.	heveriko fa tsy mahazatra izahay taminizany
But he got nothing.	saingy tsy nahazo na inona na inona izy
The words are bad.	ratsy ny teny
We still exist.	mbola misy isika
They used to have a good age.	nahazo taona tsara izy ireo taloha
Yes, a bit new.	eny somary vaovao
Well, little man.	tsara lehilahy kely
There is no end to history.	tsy misy farany ny tantara
Certainly not these.	azo antoka fa tsy ireo
Now or not.	ankehitriny na tsy misy
And we have to do it soon.	ary tsy maintsy manao izany tsy ho ela isika
There will be no war.	tsy hisy ady
Or maybe he got it for me.	na angamba nahazo izany ho ahy izy
They already had enough.	efa nanana ny ampy izy ireo
This could be one of many other reasons.	mety ho iray aminireo antony maro hafa izany
They already had more than enough.	efa nanana mihoatra noho ny ampy izy ireo
But real life is different.	fa ny tena fiainana dia hafa
But it is ours.	fa antsika izany
The timing is wrong.	diso ny fotoana
It looks like a war.	toa ady izany
He looked up, a little thought.	nijery izy somary nieritreritra
It became crazy.	lasa adala izany
But this is not uncommon.	saingy tsy mahazatra izany
The woman was not seen.	tsy nahita ilay vehivavy
See the idea here.	jereo eto ny hevitra
The usual long, unseen.	ny mahazatra ela tsy hita
Of course he could have done it.	mazava ho azy fa afaka nanao izany izy
Probably no one was looking at them.	tsy nisy nijery azy ireo angamba
I hope the question comes soon.	manantena aho fa tsy ho ela ny fanontaniana
It really happened to me, as usual.	tena nisy izany tamiko toy ny mahazatra
We all watch.	mijery isika rehetra
So of course.	ka mazava ho azy
The man was happy when he was full.	nahafinaritra ilay lehilahy rehefa feno ny tenany
He looks a little crazy.	toa adala kely izy
Not looking.	tsy mijery
The first and last are good.	ny voalohany sy ny farany dia tsara
And the idea has to make sense.	ary tsy maintsy misy dikany ny hevitra
However, bad.	na izany aza ratsy
Likewise, over and over again.	toy izany koa hatrany hatrany
Someone died there.	nisy olona maty tao
Never lose your mind.	aza very hevitra mihitsy
They made money that way.	nahazo vola taminizany fomba izany izy ireo
Everything really came to me.	tena tonga tamiko ny zavadrehetra
I think he's right.	heveriko fa mety izy
So he’s unusual.	noho izany dia tsy mahazatra izy
Yes, he may be right.	eny marina angamba izy
I think .	heveriko fa
It made sense in the past and still exists today.	nisy dikany izany taloha ary mbola misy ankehitriny
Look here and here.	jereo eto sy eto
But neither is it possible.	tsy azo atao koa anefa izany
This is about many other things.	izany dia momba ny zavatra maro hafa
We saw that stuff.	nahita izany zavatra izany izahay
I don't see this man anymore.	tsy hitako intsony io lehilahy io
But he has gone too far.	fa lasa lavitra izy
I just need a little space.	mila toerana kely fotsiny aho
And now for sure.	ary izao dia azo antoka
And they always are.	ary izy ireo foana
Just the essentials.	ny tena ilaina fotsiny
Although not entirely certain.	na dia tsy azo antoka tanteraka aza
I can’t have a life with him without it.	tsy afaka manana fiainana miaraka aminy aho raha tsy misy izany
He didn't see her much.	tsy dia nahita azy loatra izy
Maybe they really existed.	angamba tena nisy izy ireo
And this one from last year.	ary ity iray ity taminny taona lasa
As low as possible.	any ambany indrindra araka izay azo atao
I love both.	tiako izy roa
Maybe, maybe, there will still be people there.	angamba angamba mbola hisy olona any
He looks good anyway.	toa tsara izy na izany na tsy izany
You will do the same.	hanao izany koa ianao
Close to the house.	akaiky ny trano
Especially when they come to you.	indrindra rehefa tonga any aminao izy ireo
To see him at different times.	ny mahita azy aminny fotoana samy hafa
And it can be so.	ary mety ho izany tokoa
Something is missing from it.	misy zavatra tsy ampy aminy
But there will be more money.	fa mbola hisy vola bebe kokoa
I know we do, and we do perfectly.	fantatro fa manao izany isika ary manao tanteraka
But what was true did not matter.	tsy nisy dikany anefa izay marina
You have two.	manana roa ianao
They are not alone.	tsy irery izy ireo
Either one is possible.	na ny iray dia azo atao
From then on, there was something else inside.	nanomboka teo dia nisy zavatra hafa tao anatiny
I never thought he didn’t want to do that.	tsy nieritreritra mihitsy aho hoe tsy te hanao izany izy
Both said no.	samy nilaza izy roa fa tsia
If anything this is fun.	raha misy ity dia mahafinaritra
It’s the same with him.	mitovy aminy izany
But then he stopped.	nijanona anefa izy avy eo
But an idea came to him.	nisy hevitra tonga tao aminy anefa
They had thought of everything.	efa nieritreritra ny zavadrehetra izy ireo
He almost died himself.	saika maty ny tenany
But there are many more of us today.	mbola betsaka kokoa anefa isika ankehitriny
Only here are the two.	eto ihany no misy azy roa
You.	ianao
Now, these things are no problem.	ankehitriny tsy misy olana ireo zavatra ireo
Some are good and some are really bad.	ny sasany tsara ary ny sasany tena ratsy
But it turns out that’s what it is.	saingy hita fa izay no azy
It's too crazy.	adala loatra izany
But he left too.	fa lasa koa izy
And he never told her.	ary tsy nilaza taminy mihitsy izy
There seemed to be something missing.	toa nisy zavatra tsy ampy
But that doesn't seem to be true.	toa tsy marina anefa ilay resaka
Maybe, he finally said.	angamba hoy izy farany
These may be the smallest but not the last.	ireo dia mety ho kely indrindra fa tsy farany
He looks bad.	toa ratsy izy
More importantly, he loves her again.	ny zavadehibe kokoa dia tia azy indray izy
This is the right home.	io no trano mety
They shouldn’t be too fast either.	tsy tokony ho haingana be koa izy ireo
But I had a question.	nisy fanontaniana iray anefa aho
I disagree, you can’t do everything for yourself.	tsy mitovy hevitra tsy afaka manao ho azy ny zavadrehetra ianao
It's not far.	tsy lavitra ilay izy
And maybe they will.	ary angamba hanao izany izy ireo
These things are meaningless.	ireo zavatra ireo dia tsy misy dikany
None in the past.	tsy nisy taminny lasa
They are better because they work better.	tsara kokoa izy ireo satria miasa kokoa
The truth is he was never there.	ny marina dia tsy tao mihitsy izy
It’s really fun for you.	tena mahafinaritra anao izany
The same is true of all men.	toy izany koa ny lehilahy rehetra
This is the first game, and these are tough.	io no lalao voalohany ary sarotra ireo
That is, he is doing the right thing.	izany hoe manao ny marina izy
They keep coming.	tonga hatrany izy ireo
I want you to do the same here.	tiako mba hanao toy izany koa ianao eto
In fact, at this stage, it is good for me.	raha ny marina aminity dingana ity dia tsara amiko izany
They are two different lives.	fiainana roa samy hafa izy ireo
However, you have to have the money.	na izany aza tsy maintsy manana ny vola
I know each of them well.	fantatro tsara ny tsirairay aminizy ireo
Much better than the first.	tsara lavitra noho ny voalohany
The two steps are very different.	ny dingana roa dia tena samy hafa
He was completely complete in every step.	izy dia feno tanteraka taminny dingana rehetra
The face looks at us.	mijery antsika ny tarehy
There is no money in it now.	tsy misy vola ao izao
You already know how.	efa fantatrao ny fomba
The first two are easy.	mora ny roa voalohany
We both have.	samy manana isika
Both are not good, of course.	samy tsy tsara mazava ho azy
Sometimes they did.	nanao izany izy ireo indraindray
But as a person.	fa toy ny olona
They are perfect.	tanteraka izy ireo
And he is better than good.	ary tsara noho ny tsara izy
I really don't know.	tena tsy fantatro
You can do this easily, if you like.	afaka manao izany mora foana ianao raha tianao
It all starts with that.	manomboka aminizany ny rehetra
There are no results at all.	tsy misy vokatra mihitsy
A long time has passed.	fotoana ela no lasa
Otherwise, they do nothing.	raha tsy izany dia tsy manao na inona na inona izy ireo
I want to do something special.	te hanao zavatra manokana aho
The two did not see.	tsy nahita izy roa
Not enough games.	tsy ampy lalao
It came to me very quickly.	tonga tamiko haingana be izany
I looked to the future.	nijery ny ho avy aho
It’s really about that.	tena momba izany
You didn't.	tsy nanao ianao
They are all gone now.	lasa izy rehetra izao
It has always been and always will be.	teo foana izy io ary mbola hisy foana
These ideas are very true.	marina tokoa ireo hevitra ireo
But pretty, not too much.	saingy tsara tarehy tsy dia be loatra
It all has to be seen.	tsy maintsy ho hita daholo izany
He could have done it easily.	afaka nanao izany mora foana izy
I just came here.	tonga eto fotsiny aho
But many people really love them.	tena tia azy ireo anefa ny olona maro
Maybe he has a problem of his own.	angamba manana olana ho azy manokana izy
All of the above moments exist with the same facts.	ny fotoana ambony rehetra dia misy miaraka aminny zavamisy mitovy
Never die.	aza mety maty mihitsy
Of course you are.	mazava ho azy fa ianao
Everything and nothing.	ny zavadrehetra ary ny tsy misy azy
Sometimes it really gets to you.	indraindray dia tena mahazo anao izany
And it’s a big job.	ary asa lehibe izany
We have a good question.	manana fanontaniana tsara izahay
In fact, you have nothing.	raha ny marina dia tsy manana na inona na inona ianao
I am only one thing.	zavatra iray ihany aho
He’s great, you know.	lehibe izy fantatrao
He pretended not to see me.	nanao toy ny tsy nahita ahy izy
I love having a lot of time together.	tiako ny manana fotoana betsaka miaraka
If we have money, we can do the same.	raha manana vola izahay dia mety hanao izany koa
Start looking at everything.	manomboka mijery ny zavadrehetra
But here we have a lot of space.	saingy eto dia manana toerana be dia be izahay
That seems like an old idea.	toa hevitra taloha izany
His land.	ny tany misy azy
But it’s more than that.	saingy mihoatra izany
A fun time with fun people finding fun games.	fotoana mahafinaritra miaraka aminny olona mahafinaritra mahita lalao mahafinaritra
I know you like things like this.	fantatro fa tianao ny zavatra toy izao
I don’t see it personally.	tsy hitako manokana izany
But these days seem to be far away from us now.	saingy toa lasa lavitra antsika ireo andro ireo ankehitriny
There should be no more houses like this.	tsy tokony hisy intsony ny trano toy izao
He is always a reason.	antony foana izy
Too much truth.	be loatra ny marina
It was just like a picture.	toy ny sary fotsiny ilay izy
Every game, in fact.	ny lalao rehetra raha ny marina
She seemed happy and loved it.	toa faly izy ary tiany izany
You will love this place.	ho tianao ity toerana ity
It can be done more than others.	azo natao kokoa noho ny hafa izany
And people are just starting out.	ary vao manomboka izao ny olona
We were almost there, almost there.	saika teo izahay saika teo
And they all did it easily.	ary samy nanao izany mora foana izy rehetra
But there was a reality.	nisy anefa ny zavamisy
There is no better place for action.	tsy misy toerana tsara indrindra ho anny hetsika
didn't think so.	tsy nieritreritra izany
Not now.	tsy izao aloha izao
They work the land.	miasa ny tany izy ireo
You need to get here now.	mila tonga eto ianao izao
I went the other way.	nandeha lalana hafa aho
So there was no one left.	koa tsy nisy olona intsony izy
Probably for the following reason.	mety ho noho ity antony manaraka ity
It is dead.	efa maty izany
It's just like him.	toa azy ihany izany
However, it is not very clear, when it comes to people.	na izany aza tsy dia mazava loatra raha ny momba ny olona
As in the process.	toy ny taminny dingana
This car has it all.	manana ny zavadrehetra ity fiara ity
He loved crowded houses.	tiany ny trano feno olona
He needed to do something.	nila nanao zavatra izy
Just an idea.	hevitra fotsiny
Today they should come.	anio no tokony ho tonga izy ireo
And everyone is happy.	ary faly ny rehetra
They are there for you.	eo ho anao izy ireo
You really come up with a great story.	tena tonga miaraka aminny tantara mahafinaritra ianao
They looked down.	nijery tany ambany izy ireo
They always have.	manana foana izy ireo
Sure, they can get other jobs.	azo antoka fa afaka mahazo asa hafa izy ireo
All of this also makes sense.	misy dikany koa izany rehetra izany
One of these things is different from the other.	ny iray aminireo zavatra ireo dia tsy mitovy aminny iray hafa
It could be part of it.	mety ho ny ampahany aminizany
A little bit maybe.	kely kely angamba
So it’s not the good and the bad.	noho izany dia tsy ny tsara sy ny ratsy
I love it too.	tiako ihany koa izany
Do what you can when you can.	ataovy izay azonao atao rehefa azonao atao
Of course, they are not alone in this.	mazava ho azy fa tsy irery izy ireo aminizany
Everyone is looking at you.	mijery anao ny rehetra
I didn't see a car there.	tsy nahita fiara aho teo
That money is important.	zavadehibe io vola io
The worst was at night.	ny ratsy indrindra dia taminny alina
To work is to be a good person.	ny miasa dia ny ho olona tsara
He had not died in a long time.	efa ela izy no tsy maty
He wanted to be a man.	te ho lasa lehilahy izy
You want them to know that you are there.	tianao ho fantany fa eo ianao
I personally think she is beautiful.	heveriko manokana fa tsara tarehy izy
He did the same himself.	nanao toy izany koa ny tenany
The question must come.	tsy maintsy ho avy ny fanontaniana
In a story, you do that.	ao aminny tantara iray manao izany ianao
Home building.	trano trano
I think this year is different.	heveriko fa hafa ity taona ity
Yes, really one.	eny tena iray
But no, it really is.	saingy tsia tena misy izany
The man was wrong.	diso hevitra ilay lehilahy
And by all means, don’t go alone.	ary aminny fomba rehetra aza mandeha manokana

More than a species.	mihoatra noho ny karazana
There will still be action.	mbola hisy ny hetsika
That might be a good idea.	mety ho hevitra tsara izany
Yes to all yes.	eny ny eny rehetra
We are not because of that.	tsy noho izany izahay
And not everyone is good.	ary tsy ny rehetra no tsara

The thing is there.	ao ilay zavatra

In the end, he never came.	farany dia tsy tonga mihitsy izy
And a lot of time.	ary fotoana be

I don't see what could be the problem.	tsy hitako izay mety ho olana
I have no words.	tsy manana teny aho
He loves money.	tia vola izy
To him, they seemed to be everywhere.	aminy dia toa teny rehetra teny izy ireo
Or maybe we won’t.	na angamba tsy hanao izany isika
We saw nothing and no one.	tsy nahita na inona na inona izahay ary tsy nisy olona
We will come to the present time.	ho tonga aminizao fotoana izao isika
Make sure there is money there.	ataovy azo antoka fa misy vola any
Yes, a little time.	eny fotoana kely
However, something is still wrong.	na izany aza dia mbola misy zavatra tsy mety
I think it exists.	heveriko fa misy izany
We are watching you.	mijery anao izahay
I don’t think anyone did that.	heveriko fa tsy nisy nanao izany
But not happy.	fa tsy faly
Of course, that may not be a good thing.	mazava ho azy fa mety tsy ho zavatra tsara izany
Then another one away.	avy eo ny iray hafa lavitra
It doesn’t make much sense, he said.	tsy misy dikany loatra hoy izy
Nothing is clearer than that.	tsy misy zavatra mazava kokoa noho izany
But it's good that you're not here.	fa tsara raha tsy eto ianao
There will be no more war.	tsy hisy ady intsony
And see you.	ary mahita anao
He already is.	efa izy
The bigger the problem, the better.	ny lehibe kokoa ny olana ny tsara kokoa
If so, they are wrong.	raha izany no izy dia diso izy ireo
Of course, you disagree.	mazava ho azy fa tsy mitovy hevitra ianao
I know him better than you do.	fantatro tsara noho ianao izy
There is still something to be done.	mbola misy zavatra ilaina
We can never.	tsy afaka mihitsy izahay
There must have been others.	tsy maintsy nisy hafa koa
It's night, you know.	efa alina izao fantatrao
He works here.	miasa eto izy
It will be something closer and closer.	izany dia ho zavatra akaiky kokoa sy akaiky kokoa
I just love this moment.	tiako fotsiny ity fotoana ity
And it is about to happen.	ary efa ho tanteraka izao
I have no one.	tsy manana olona aho
Which seems unnecessary.	izay toa tsy ilaina
That’s the idea, though.	izany no hevitra na izany aza
That, is a lot of people.	izany dia olona maro
I do something.	manao zavatra aho
But the war.	fa ny ady
We just have to go it alone.	mila mandeha irery fotsiny isika
Surely he saw me and paused for a moment.	azo antoka fa nahita ahy izy ary nijanona kely
There was nothing for them.	tsy nisy na inona na inona ho azy ireo
It’s just not uncommon.	tsy mahazatra fotsiny izany
Very good here.	tena tsara eto
But you may need to find the time.	mety mila mahita ny fotoana anefa
People you know.	olona fantatrao
Sometimes he does, sometimes he doesn’t.	indraindray manao izany izy indraindray tsy manao izany
But, nonetheless, one looks at it.	saingy na izany aza ny iray mijery azy
They often went for others.	matetika izy ireo no nandeha ho anny hafa
And not from far away either.	ary tsy avy lavitra koa
I love a lot of other things now.	tia zavatra maro hafa aho izao
But that should not have happened.	tsy tokony ho nisy anefa izany
Inside, you don’t need anything.	ao anatiny dia tsy mila na inona na inona ianao
You will also know where you are.	ho fantatrao koa ny toerana misy anao
It would be foolish not to do so.	mety ho adala ny tsy nanao izany
Of course he does, he said.	mazava ho azy fa manao izany izy hoy izy
He had to do the right thing.	tsy maintsy nanao ny marina izy
Or for me.	na ho ahy
He is very strong.	tena mafy be izy
You need a job.	mila asa ianao
You are not too bad.	tsy dia ratsy loatra ianao
It’s harder.	mafy kokoa izany
It was as if he had never seen it before.	toy ny hoe mbola tsy nahita mihitsy izy taloha
Which made sense.	izay nisy dikany
But he must always be good.	tsy maintsy ho tsara foana anefa izy
It is itself.	izy io mihitsy
Definitely the right man for the job.	azo antoka fa ilay lehilahy mety aminny asa
Better than the woman before.	tsara kokoa noho ilay vehivavy teo aloha
When he did, it was not clear at all.	rehefa nanao izany izy dia tsy mazava mihitsy
I need you to do some things.	mila anao hanao zavatra sasany aho
Not even the future.	tsy ny ho avy akory
Good results are no.	ny vokatra tsara dia tsia
He is always around.	manodidina foana izy
Easier and less costly.	mora kokoa ary tsy dia misy dikany loatra
He couldn't think about it.	tsy afaka nieritreritra momba izany izy
Very little again.	kely be indray
It was many years ago.	efa taona maro lasa izay
Which doesn’t seem to be the case.	izay toa tsy izany
And he knew.	ary dia fantany
It’s not just for women, in fact.	tsy natao ho anny vehivavy ihany izany raha ny marina
That’s not everything, but things.	tsy izany no zavadrehetra fa zavatra
They did what they liked best.	nanao izay tiany indrindra izy ireo
That's the idea.	izay ilay hevitra
I have yet to see him go so fast.	mbola tsy nahita azy nandeha haingana be aho
Can't, of course.	tsy afaka mazava ho azy
Only the best deserve you.	ny tsara indrindra ihany no mendrika anao
Lost this and many more.	very izany sy ny maro hafa
This is not at all the case.	tsy izany mihitsy no zavamisy
None of them have been found yet.	tsy mbola hita na iray aza izy ireo
Some are going well.	misy mandeha tsara
None of them were fun.	tsy nisy nahafinaritra azy ireo
It's a little different.	hafa kely izany
But some of those around me have to follow me.	saingy tsy maintsy manaraka ahy ny sasany aminireo manodidina ahy
The food arrived.	tonga ny sakafo
However, this is probably the best.	na izany aza io angamba no tsara indrindra
Certainly there are the least.	azo antoka fa misy ny kely indrindra
He seems to be in a very good position.	toa eo aminny toerana tena tsara izy
They seemed very happy.	toa faly be izy ireo
Here comes a big problem.	tonga eto ny olana lehibe iray
He really saw them.	tena nahita azy ireo izy
But that doesn't seem to be true.	toa tsy marina kely anefa izany
The problem for me is the method.	ny olana amiko dia ny fomba
There is something similar.	misy zavatra mitovy aminizany
Yes, it may not be.	eny mety tsy izany
Which is very different from me.	izay tena tsy mitovy amiko
Many of them are still there.	betsaka aminizy ireo no mbola eo
It takes a while to find a suitable match.	mila fotoana kely vao mahita lalao mety
Just a little way.	fomba kely fotsiny
This is very important.	tena lehibe izany
In the end it will be the best.	aminny farany dia ho tsara indrindra izany
He needed to go.	nila nandeha izy
But even so, it seems simple.	saingy na dia izany aza dia toa tsotra izany
But it is certainly worth it.	azo antoka anefa fa mety izany
He should be there.	tokony ho eo izy
And they are very different.	ary tena tsy mitovy izy ireo
I'm not doing anything.	tsy manao na inona na inona aho
You have to start with that.	tsy maintsy manomboka aminizany ianao
By age.	aminny taona
They also follow me from time to time.	manaraka ahy koa izy ireo indraindray
Lots of food.	sakafo be dia be
It’s hard for me to get it.	sarotra amiko ny mahazo izany
This is because of choice.	izany dia noho ny safidy
The trip was great.	tena tsara ny dia
They are from a different world than this one.	avy aminny tontolo hafa noho ity iray ity izy ireo
Of course, it’s harder than that.	mazava ho azy fa sarotra kokoa noho izany
I won't be there again.	tsy ho any intsony
And they start working.	ary manomboka miasa izy ireo
And you can work too if you want.	ary afaka miasa koa ianao raha tianao
I think someone has to look good.	heveriko fa tsy maintsy mijery tsara ny olona iray
This result is still uncertain.	mbola tsy azo antoka izany vokatra izany
So, check this out.	noho izany jereo ity
This is the real job.	izany no tena asa
These guys are really good.	tena tsara ireo lehilahy ireo
There is always so much to do.	be dia be foana ny zavatra atao
So will we.	ho toy izany koa isika
But he is very good.	fa tena tsara izy
They may be as clear as day.	mety ho mazava toy ny andro izy ireo
Maybe do something out of it one day.	angamba hanao zavatra avy aminizany indray andro any
But he sees nothing.	tsy mahita na inona na inona anefa izy
Everyone is as good as you.	ny olona rehetra dia tsara toa anao
Things like that have become commonplace.	lasa mahazatra ny zavatra toy izany
The big day is near.	efa akaiky ny andro lehibe
I don't want to do that tonight.	tsy te hanao izany aho anio alina
You may be dead.	mety efa maty ianao
He didn't see us.	tsy nahita anay izy
But it doesn’t seem to work.	toa tsy miasa anefa
When he arrived, it was too small.	rehefa tonga izy dia kely loatra
Something worth more money.	zavatra mendrika vola kokoa
You know, for fast food.	fantatrao ho anny sakafo haingana
No one deserves that idea.	tsy misy mendrika izany hevitra izany
We only went there once.	indray mandeha ihany izahay no nandeha tany
Always and alone.	foana sy irery
I love these guys now.	tiako ireo lehilahy ireo aminizao fotoana izao
But he had the money.	nanana ny vola anefa izy
That's too bad.	tena ratsy loatra izany
In fact, not happy.	raha ny marina tsy faly
But people like him are important.	zavadehibe anefa ny olona toa azy
It doesn’t start out easy.	tsy manomboka mora izany
There are always other options.	misy safidy hafa foana
Because it's not.	satria tsy izany
No one will be around.	tsy hisy olona manodidina
So little man.	ka lehilahy kely
Happy, actually.	faly raha ny marina
Before and now.	teo aloha ary izao
There are no cars around him.	tsy misy fiara manodidina azy
It’s okay if you don’t.	tsara raha tsy manao izany ianao
More than anything else.	mihoatra noho ny zavatra hafa rehetra
These are all new.	vaovao daholo ireo
I didn’t go very far either.	tsy tonga dia lavitra koa aho
He just didn’t go.	tsy nandeha fotsiny izy
He seems insecure.	toa tsy azo antoka izy
Nothing simple.	tsy misy zavatra tsotra
We disagree with you.	tsy mitovy hevitra aminao izahay
I think there was a place there.	heveriko fa nisy toerana tao
When he left, it was as if someone had disappeared.	rehefa lasa izy dia toy ny hoe nisy olona tsy hita
But the meaning.	fa ny dikany
But you are wrong there.	fa diso ianao any
Both are real, because they work.	samy zavamisy satria miasa
I've been thinking a lot.	efa nieritreritra be aho
I know him and I know him.	fantatro izy ary fantany aho
And it started there.	dia nanomboka teo izany
Any method is possible.	ny fomba rehetra dia mety
It’s nice to see more of that.	mahafinaritra ny mahita bebe kokoa aminizany
He was very happy.	tena faly tokoa izy
In the game, though.	ao aminny lalao na izany aza
No one was looking at me.	tsy nisy nijery ahy
This may also be true.	mety ho marina koa izany
Some methods seem right and some don’t.	ny fomba sasany toa mety ary ny sasany tsy mety
He will be there.	ho eo izy
This thing seems easy.	toa mora ity zavatra ity
In fact, he was a real man.	raha ny marina tena lehilahy izy
Not today.	tsy aminizao andro izao
One thing or another.	zavatra iray na hafa
Love you then and now.	tia anao taloha sy ankehitriny
See it in all the stories about him.	jereo izany aminny tantara rehetra momba azy
And all these other bad things.	ary ireo zavatra ratsy hafa rehetra ireo
A worthy one.	iray mendrika
In those days, however, that was not possible.	taminizany andro izany anefa dia tsy azo natao izany
I have never seen such a handsome man.	tsy mbola nahita lehilahy tsara tarehy toy izany
Not too much of a question.	tsy dia fanontaniana loatra
And that’s where the problem lies.	ary ao no misy io olana io
It couldn't do anything.	tsy afaka nanao na inona na inona izany
He also seemed to be dead.	toy ny maty ihany koa izy
These were completely meaningless.	tsy nisy dikany mihitsy ireo
He was almost there.	saika teo izy
We are like him.	mitovy aminy isika
I hope they come again one day.	manantena aho fa ho avy indray izy ireo indray andro any
However, the result will be worth it.	na izany aza ny vokatra dia ho mendrika izany
Now he is coming to a big stage.	ankehitriny izy dia tonga aminny dingana lehibe
They don’t seem to be working.	toa tsy mandeha izy ireo
The worst.	ny tena ratsy
There is no way otherwise.	tsy misy fomba raha tsy izany
He seemed to die inside.	toa maty tao anatiny izy
But they did not come.	tsy tonga anefa izy ireo
But the results were wrong.	diso anefa ny vokatra
I've watched it before.	efa nijery azy aho taloha
It was a car.	fiara ilay izy
I enjoyed them more.	nahafinaritra ahy kokoa izy ireo
Everyone was happy and excited.	faly sy faly ny rehetra
We are one.	iray ihany isika
He couldn't stop watching.	tsy afaka nijanona nijery izy
Because you know it.	satria fantatrao izany
There were no words.	tsy nisy teny
You really enjoy this.	tena mahafinaritra anao ity
But everything went quickly.	nandeha haingana anefa ny zavadrehetra
The place is empty.	foana ny toerana
He is too close.	tena akaiky loatra izy
We all do good things.	manao zavatra tsara isika rehetra
And sometimes it can.	ary indraindray dia mety izany
But you can.	fa mety ianao
I hope there aren’t too many of them.	manantena aho fa tsy dia maro loatra izy ireo
It wasn’t quite a fun time like when I was a kid.	tsy tena fotoana mahafinaritra toy ny taminny mbola kely
It’s even more than that.	mbola mihoatra noho izany aza izany
Not for him alone anymore.	tsy ho azy irery intsony
But we are not there yet.	saingy mbola tsy eo isika
It really loves you.	tena tia anao izany
The house went crazy.	lasa adala ny trano
Maybe the world is dead.	angamba maty izao tontolo izao
A small world maybe.	tontolo kely angamba
That word over and over again.	io teny io hatrany hatrany
And then they are completely for me.	ary avy eo dia ho ahy tanteraka izy ireo
But not for the same reasons as before.	saingy tsy noho ny antony mitovy aminny teo aloha
That's enough reason.	ampy izay ny antony
Surely we will not be there when he dies.	azo antoka fa tsy ho eo isika rehefa maty izy
This thing is so much bigger than, anything.	ity zavatra ity dia lehibe lavitra noho ny na inona na inona
Lots of great ideas.	hevitra mahafinaritra be dia be
He did three steps at once.	nanao dingana telo indray mandeha izy
But these may not be true.	saingy tsy mety ho marina ireo
And we don’t expect them.	ary tsy manantena azy ireo izahay
It’s really fun for a fun reason.	tena mahafinaritra tokoa izany noho ny antony mahafinaritra
There was no question of women.	tsy nisy resaka vehivavy akory
Now and again.	ankehitriny ary indray
Just from the pictures.	avy aminny sary fotsiny
I really follow you.	tena manaraka anao aho
So there is the real problem.	noho izany dia misy ny tena olana
That first time and all the other times.	izay fotoana voalohany sy ireo fotoana hafa rehetra
So he made it real at the time.	noho izany dia nanao izany ho tena izy taminizany fotoana izany
This is also not possible.	tsy azo natao koa izany
No one was sure.	tsy nisy azo antoka
No one else can.	tsy misy olona hafa afaka
He turned out to be right.	hita fa marina izy
Not much to say.	tsy be teny
Not good, but it could be worse.	tsy tsara saingy mety ho ratsy kokoa izany
Not necessarily, but possible.	tsy hoe tsy maintsy fa mety
He deserves it.	mendrika izany izy
I think he was right, actually.	heveriko fa marina izy raha ny marina
Everything was different there.	hafa ny zavadrehetra tao
These words are very common.	ireo teny ireo dia tena mahazatra
He just loved her.	tiany fotsiny izy
We have to go! ' 	tokony ho any isika
We need one on a night like this.	mila iray aminny alina toy izao isika
None of that is good.	tsy misy tsara izany
More is about more.	ny bebe kokoa dia momba ny bebe kokoa
Do it and don’t do it.	manao izany ary tsy manao izany
Maybe it never will.	angamba tsy hisy mihitsy izany
I immediately liked him.	tonga dia tiako izy
I really like him.	tena tiako be izy
But that's the way it is in general.	izany anefa aminny ankapobeny
You really have an idea about that.	tena manana hevitra momba izany ianao
No one was around.	tsy nisy olona teo aminny manodidina azy
The problem started early.	nanomboka aloha ny olana
It’s not a question for him.	tsy resaka ho azy izany
It could be him.	mety ho azy izany
However, all good things must come to an end.	na izany aza ny zavatra tsara rehetra dia tsy maintsy tonga aminny farany
Either way, there are good and bad.	na izany na tsy izany misy tsara ny ratsy
And we are all the same.	ary mitovy daholo isika rehetra
It just does that.	izy io ihany no manao izany
But they are not big.	tsy lehibe anefa izy ireo
I am starting a new life.	manomboka fiainana vaovao aho
In fact, he is not very good.	raha ny marina tsy dia tsara izy
The work is really not too bad.	tena tsy dia ratsy loatra ilay asa
The good one.	ilay tsara
They are not all the same.	tsy mitovy daholo izy ireo
It seems simple to me.	toa tsotra amiko izany
Of course, life is not that easy.	mazava ho azy anefa fa tsy mora toy izany ny fiainana
Certainly not everyone.	azo antoka fa tsy tsirairay
No reason, no choice.	tsy misy antony tsy misy safidy
Last two thoughts and questions.	hevitra sy fanontaniana roa farany
There was just no one.	tsy nisy olona ihany
I came to that.	tonga taminizany aho
We, more time.	izahay fotoana bebe kokoa
He said people expect certain things.	nilaza izy fa manantena zavatra sasany ny olona
And when it comes, it comes.	ary rehefa tonga izany dia tonga
We both need money.	samy mila vola izahay
This is a familiar land to me.	ity dia tany mahazatra ahy
When he needs a good day, he gets a good day.	rehefa mila andro tsara izy dia mahazo andro tsara
Basically they will do everything but not individually.	aminny ankapobeny dia samy hanao ny zavadrehetra izy ireo fa tsy ny tsirairay
It’s all over the place.	eny rehetra eny izany
But it’s hard.	saingy sarotra izany
Here at first.	eto aminny voalohany
Something for everyone, really.	zavatra ho anny rehetra tena
You are like him.	mitovy aminy koa ianao
You already know him.	efa fantatrao izy
In the future, yes.	aminny ho avy eny
Both of these problems have their causes.	samy manana ny antony ireo olana ireo
They are real and true.	tena izy ireo ary marina
The question remained.	nijanona ny fanontaniana
Now, he thought.	izao hoy izy nieritreritra
That's right, man.	marina izany lehilahy
He made the food himself.	izy mihitsy no nanao ny sakafo
He needed something.	nila zavatra izy
Now, those stories.	ankehitriny ireo tantara ireo
But this is not a matter of money.	tsy resaka vola anefa izany
But, it should.	saingy tokony
I don't have much.	tsy manana be aho
It’s not that it really matters.	tsy hoe tena zavadehibe izany
And they saw it.	ary nahita izy ireo
The last two or three days, maybe.	ny roa na telo andro farany angamba
One reason may be timing.	ny antony iray dia mety ho ny fotoana
In fact, it really doesn’t make sense.	raha ny marina dia tena tsy misy dikany izany
Or something close to it.	na zavatra akaiky azy
And he does.	ary manao izany izy
But you seem to know that.	saingy toa fantatrao izany
I think you are too.	heveriko fa toy izany koa ianao
Look at the car.	jereo ny fiara
I may be wrong about some things.	mety ho diso hevitra aho aminny zavatra sasany
But, of course, they need both.	saingy mazava ho azy dia mila izy roa
They are generally non -existent.	aminny ankapobeny dia tsy misy izy ireo
This is something that really matters to people.	izany dia zavatra tena misy dikany aminny olona
You don’t need all of these.	tsy mila ireo rehetra ireo ianao
I'm not with that.	tsy miaraka aminizany aho
She’s beautiful, but really not my type.	tsara tarehy izy saingy tena tsy karazana ahy
Not too much, of course.	tsy dia be loatra mazava ho azy
Now the two are gone.	ankehitriny dia lasa izy roa
Some people work harder than others.	misy olona miasa mafy kokoa noho ny hafa
There had to be other options as well.	tsy maintsy nisy safidy hafa koa
I think that's the problem.	heveriko fa izay no olana
But this place is not just for women.	tsy ho anny vehivavy ihany anefa io toerana io
He was driving.	nandeha fiara izy
They are gone now.	lasa izy ireo izao
I think I really enjoyed this story.	heveriko fa tena nahafinaritra ahy ity tantara ity
It needs, more than anything else, history.	mila mihoatra noho ny zavatra hafa rehetra tantara
Look at the man.	jereo ny lehilahy
This turns out to be only partially true.	izany dia hita fa ampahany ihany no marina
No one told me the road would be easy.	tsy nisy nilaza tamiko fa ho mora ny lalana
It’s something for me.	misy zavatra amiko izany
But it was nice to have more time.	nahafinaritra anefa ny nanana fotoana bebe kokoa
I should be dead by now.	tokony efa maty aho izao
Every day, every day.	ny andro rehetra ny andro rehetra
Or maybe he did.	na angamba nanao izany izy
But he is not far away.	tsy lavitra anefa izy
And, often, you don’t know.	ary matetika tsy fantatrao
Apparently it really works.	hita fa miasa tokoa izany
Now that’s a very common thing.	ankehitriny dia zavatra tena mahazatra izany
And mine too.	ary ny ahy koa
I’ve been there recently, and a lot before.	efa tany aho vao haingana ary be dia be teo aloha
It’s a fun time, but it’s never enough.	fotoana mahafinaritra izany saingy tsy ampy mihitsy
It is not of this world.	tsy eto aminizao tontolo izao izany
He probably won't be here.	tsy ho eto angamba izy
Hence the.	noho izany ny
But it’s never crowded.	saingy tsy feno olona mihitsy
He went further.	lasa lavitra kokoa izy
We had no idea.	tsy nanana hevitra izahay
However, they have.	na izany aza manana izy ireo
You are a nice guy but not my type.	lehilahy mahafinaritra ianao fa tsy karazana ahy
It was really unpleasant.	tena tsy nahafinaritra ilay izy
It is also very suitable for him.	tena mety aminy koa izany
So the day was good.	noho izany dia tsara ny andro
The car is as fast as possible.	ny fiara dia haingana araka izay azo atao
As for me, it’s a little different from the others.	raha ny amiko dia hafa kely aminny hafa
Another story, another story.	tantara hafa tantara hafa
There is something else in the world about the product.	misy zavatra hafa aminizao tontolo izao momba ny vokatra
They are almost nothing.	saika tsy misy na inona na inona izy ireo
Even pictures.	na sary aza
This game is even better.	mbola tsara kokoa ity lalao ity
He has never done anything.	mbola tsy nanao zavatra mihitsy izy
And now you are good to me.	ary ankehitriny tsara amiko ianao
Of course it's that simple.	mazava ho azy fa tsotra izany
Many have more.	maro no manana bebe kokoa
And so on next year.	ary toy izany koa ny taona manaraka
Not all stories are enough.	tsy ampy ny tantara rehetra
Sometimes it is the same.	toy izany koa indraindray
Even if you don’t have it yet.	na dia mbola tsy manana aza ianao
But he was good.	saingy tsara izy
That’s not the least.	tsy izany no kely
This is not a quick job.	tsy asa haingana izany
I had them.	nanana azy ireo aho
I think they will come here now.	heveriko fa ho tonga eto izy ireo izao
Words that don't even make sense.	teny tsy nisy dikany akory
The place seems familiar.	toa mahazatra ilay toerana
You got it in the first place.	nahazo izany ianao taminny voalohany
He knows better now.	fantany tsara kokoa izao
It came and he was very happy.	tonga izany ary faly be izy
They really do the game.	tena manao ny lalao izy ireo
I'm going to go crazy.	ho lasa adala aho
And he thought the same thing.	dia nieritreritra izany koa izy
They are no more accurate.	tsy marina kokoa izy ireo
Same for all men.	mitovy aminny lehilahy rehetra
It’s a story.	tantara izany
In fact, it really isn’t.	raha ny marina dia tsy izany tokoa
There seems to be no more war in him.	toa tsy misy ady intsony ao aminy
It’s a very simple and easy place.	toerana tena tsotra sy tsotra izy io
It could be real.	mety ho tena izy io
There was no war between them.	tsy nisy ady teo aminizy ireo
There is first.	misy aloha
He deserves better.	mendrika tsara kokoa izy
This is for you.	ho anao izao
You were not there.	tsy nisy ianao
Yes, but.	eny fa
Only one then.	iray ihany avy eo
But maybe the time has come.	fa angamba tonga ny fotoana
He still has good things.	mbola manana zavatra tsara izy
Basically they do, and they probably do.	aminny ankapobeny dia manao izany izy ireo ary mety ho izany
You are all mine.	ahy daholo ianao
This is more true than false.	marina kokoa noho ny tsy marina izany
She is.	dia dia
Not just me.	tsy amiko fotsiny
But there is a problem.	misy olana anefa izy io
We were glad there was no such thing.	faly tsy nisy toy izany izahay
It is possible to see it.	azo atao ny mahita azy
We found two major problems.	nahita olana roa lehibe izahay
And most importantly, he doesn’t need that either.	ary ny tena zavadehibe dia tsy mila izany koa izy
It’s good even if nothing else.	tsara izany na dia tsy misy zavatra hafa aza
There was something else than that.	nisy zavatra hafa noho izany
I hope to do the same someday.	manantena ny hanao izany koa aho indray andro any
There are many things you can do here.	betsaka ny zavatra azonao atao eto
You are not stupid.	tsy adala ianao
They needed the right product, not the part.	nila vokatra mety izy ireo fa tsy ampahany
It seemed like someone knew it.	toa olona fantany ilay izy
I don’t make that talk.	tsy manao anio resaka io aho
Others did the same.	nanao toy izany koa ny hafa
And then there’s this thing below.	ary avy eo dia misy ity zavatra ity any ambany
It’s very simple.	tsotra be izany
This is completely new to me.	vaovao tanteraka amiko izany
You must follow that person.	tsy maintsy manaraka anio olona io ianao
Complete and complete.	tanteraka sy tanteraka
Even though some people were killed.	na dia mbola nisy olona maty taminizany aza
More food and snacks.	sakafo sy sakafo bebe kokoa
The possibility was there.	teo ihany ny mety
There was nothing special about them.	tsy nisy zavatra manokana momba azy ireo
That’s the old thing.	izany no zavatra taloha
No one sees it.	tsy misy mahita azy
Just great.	lehibe fotsiny
It's nothing but that.	tsy inona izany fa izay
Make it very personal.	ataovy tena manokana
But, as usual, they won’t do anything.	saingy toy ny mahazatra tsy hanao na inona na inona izy ireo
There are other options as well.	misy fomba hafa azo atao koa
This is usually faster.	matetika izany dia haingana kokoa
It will be easy to do this in two steps.	ho mora ny manao izany aminny dingana roa
They are from the same world.	avy aminny tontolo iray ihany izy ireo
He seemed happy with something.	toa faly taminny zavatra iray izy
I came to that, right.	tonga aminizany aho marina
We need more to be sure.	mila bebe kokoa isika mba ho azo antoka
It’s seen over and over again.	hita hatrany hatrany izany
The worst.	ny ratsy indrindra
They said there would be a war.	nilaza izy ireo fa hisy ady
You can do so much more.	afaka manao zavatra betsaka kokoa ianao
I've seen this thing before.	efa nahita anio zavatra io aho taloha
And of course only the first three.	ary mazava ho azy fa ny telo voalohany ihany
It’s a game and it’s not real at all.	lalao ary tsy tena izy mihitsy
They just do things when they come.	manao zavatra fotsiny izy ireo rehefa tonga
And he stopped and looked.	dia nijanona izy ka nijery
Every woman has a story.	ny vehivavy tsirairay dia manana tantara
It was in the right place.	teo aminny toerana mety ilay izy
But this place is different.	hafa ihany anefa ity toerana ity
If not, people like him will do it.	raha tsy izy dia olona toa azy no hanao izany
But he knew something was wrong.	fantany anefa fa misy zavatra tsy mety
It was so much fun.	nahafinaritra loatra izany
We didn't see it.	tsy nahita izahay
There was a problem with that.	nisy olana iray taminizany
And the war came.	ary tonga ny ady
It was the same little house that did it.	io trano kely io ihany no nanao izany
But that's not good.	saingy tsy tsara izany
He needs a car.	mila fiara izy
That seems true, he told himself.	toa marina izany hoy izy taminny tenany
The food should be just for them.	ny sakafo dia tokony ho azy ireo ihany
This place is really nice.	tena mahafinaritra ity toerana ity
There it is.	misy izany
But no, no.	saingy tsia tsia
I hope everything goes well.	manantena aho fa mandeha tsara daholo
Some people are real, some are not.	ny olona sasany dia tena izy ny sasany tsy
That sounds really good.	toa tena tsara tokoa izany
Other options are worse.	ny safidy hafa dia ratsy kokoa
That’s what work is all about.	izany no atao hoe asa
Something that is not about us.	zavatra tsy momba antsika
What was meant to be, meant to be.	izay natao ho natao ho
Sometimes it just comes to them.	indraindray dia tonga aminizy ireo fotsiny izany
They seemed to do well.	toa nanao tsara izy ireo
I took the first step.	nanao ny dingana voalohany aho
Yes, that is far better.	eny tsara lavitra izany
I also had a problem.	nanana olana koa aho
In general, this is a good fit.	aminny ankapobeny dia mety tsara izany
I always have and will continue to do so.	manana foana aho ary mbola hanao izany foana
But this is not easy.	tsy tsotra anefa izany
Always the same.	mitovy foana
Even the part of the world that is close by.	eny fa na dia ny ampahany aminizao tontolo izao izay akaiky aza
Now, that’s bad.	ankehitriny ratsy izany
I have only once loved someone like that.	indray mandeha ihany aho no tia olona toy izany
Apparently not many.	hita fa tsy maro
And many more.	ary mbola maro hafa koa
One is not possible without the other.	tsy azo atao ny iray raha tsy misy ny iray
There is nothing you can do here tonight.	tsy misy azonao atao intsony eto anio alina
But maybe there are other options.	fa angamba misy safidy hafa
They are obtained in the following way.	izy ireo dia azo aminny fomba manaraka
It’s a waste of money.	very vola izany
They may not be very good people.	tsy olona tena tsara angamba izy ireo
Nothing special here.	tsy misy zavatra manokana eto
It won’t be around.	tsy ho eo aminny manodidina izany
It’s only once.	indray mandeha ihany izy io
We were always able to do that.	afaka nanao izany hatrany izahay
And it will come, and it will come in a big way.	ary mbola ho avy ary ho avy aminny fomba lehibe
It didn’t start well.	tsy nanomboka tsara izany
And they were really fun.	ary tena nahafinaritra izy ireo
We are happy to do so.	faly izahay hanao izany
I have grown up.	efa lehibe aho
These are low times.	fotoana ambany ireo
I do a lot of them.	manao betsaka aminizy ireo aho
There was nothing wrong with that now.	tsy nisy diso izany ankehitriny
Everything is close.	akaiky ny zavadrehetra
At a very pleasant time.	aminny fotoana tena mahafinaritra
One cannot do just one and not the other.	tsy afaka manao ny iray fotsiny ny iray fa tsy ny iray
Reality is not enough for us.	tsy ampy ho antsika ny zavamisy
It doesn’t seem too difficult.	toa tsy sarotra loatra izany
You can if you want.	azonao atao raha tianao
Possible problem.	olana mety
I went a long way.	nandeha ela aho
You can have it all.	afaka manana izany rehetra izany ianao
Lots of easy options.	be dia be ny safidy mora
He was completely wrong.	diso tanteraka izy
Maybe it’s better there than here.	angamba tsara kokoa ny any noho ny eto
Either way, we don’t start from scratch.	na izany na tsy izany tsy manomboka aminny voalohany isika
But they were not there.	tsy teo anefa izy ireo
They now had two options.	nanana safidy roa izy ireo izao
In fact, any reason could be good.	raha ny marina ny antony rehetra dia mety ho tsara
Everyone is still dead.	mbola maty foana ny olona rehetra
Yes, it will, always in its place.	eny hisy izany eo aminny toerana misy azy foana
We got a good idea.	nahazo hevitra tsara izahay
The guarantee is bad.	ratsy ny antoka
Two for two.	roa ho anny roa
No one even looked.	tsy nisy nijery akory
Here is a small part of it.	ity misy ampahany kely aminizany
But such a day did not come.	saingy tsy tonga ny andro toy izany
One day, it will be history.	indray andro any ho tantara izany
And then, he stopped.	ary avy eo nijanona izy
Very new indeed.	tena vaovao tokoa
People need to go further.	mila mandeha bebe kokoa ny olona
It’s just as important.	toy ny zavadehibe ihany izany
Most importantly, it’s fun to watch them.	ny tena zavadehibe dia mahafinaritra ny mijery azy ireo
It will be the same as before.	ho toy ny taloha ihany izany
We had a good car.	nanana fiara tsara izahay
I want to be the same as before.	tiako ny ho toy ny taloha
No one told me it would be like this.	tsy nisy nilaza tamiko fa ho toy izao izany
He is not too far away.	tsy dia lavitra loatra izy
He is no more.	tsy misy intsony izy
There is no way around it.	tsy misy fomba manodidina azy
It's in the old place.	eo aminny toerana taloha izany
But it will not be easy.	saingy tsy ho mora izany
But not just mine.	fa tsy ny ahy ihany
You have to come right.	tsy maintsy tonga marina ianao
I have a lot to say about him.	manana zavatra betsaka momba azy aho
But there were people.	saingy nisy olona
And it was good for him.	ary tsara taminy izany
However, he left.	na izany aza lasa izy
It should be special.	tokony ho manokana izany
Or for whatever reason.	na noho ny antony rehetra
Suitable for smaller women or men.	mety tsara ho anny vehivavy na lehilahy kely kokoa
Apparently no one at all.	toa tsy nisy olona mihitsy
But he knew it wasn't.	fantany anefa fa tsy izany
Nothing comes of it.	tsy misy na inona na inona tonga aminizany
I am always right.	marina foana aho
Lovely woman.	vehivavy mahafinaritra
He looked ahead.	nijery teo aloha izy
He had to stop thinking.	tsy maintsy nijanona tsy nieritreritra intsony izy
The little fool is good.	ny adala kely dia tsara
He should never be wrong.	tsy tokony ho diso mihitsy izy
Work is not a bad day.	tsy andro ratsy ny asa
It seems to him.	toa azy izany
We also have.	manana koa izahay
He can win any fight he wants.	afaka mahazo ny ady rehetra tiany izy
Then he looked bad.	avy eo izy dia nijery ny ratsy
It didn’t seem to matter much at the time.	toa tsy dia zavadehibe loatra izany taminizany fotoana izany
He didn't need anyone.	tsy nila olona izy
And it’s mine for life.	ary ahy izany ho anny fiainana
There is simply nothing like it.	tsy misy toa azy tsotra izao
In fact, it doesn’t work that way.	raha ny marina dia tsy miasa toy izany
I think something is missing.	heveriko fa misy zavatra tsy ampy
I think it works better.	heveriko fa miasa tsara kokoa izany
And it’s a bit easy.	ary somary mora
He had been gone for a long time.	efa ela izy no tsy nisy
But even then, it won’t be long.	saingy na izany aza dia tsy ho ela
It’s also really fun to watch.	tena mahafinaritra koa ny mijery
They are also about money and work.	izy ireo ihany koa ny vola sy ny asa
I found a problem.	nahita olana aho
Everyone should be like that.	tokony ho toy izany ny rehetra
I have looked and watched, but have not seen.	efa nijery sy nijery aho fa tsy nahita
There it is.	ao izany
Once obtained.	raha vao azo
He had no idea how to do it.	tsy nanana hevitra ny hanao izany izy
Of course, the past is important.	mazava ho azy fa zavadehibe ny lasa
We never want to get lost.	tsy te ho very mihitsy izahay
I'll be there if you need anything.	ho eo akaiky eo aho raha mila zavatra ianao
This is simply not true.	tsy marina tsotra izao
It could be a person or a job.	mety ho olona na asa izany
Do it all.	ataovy daholo izany
It's not far from me.	tsy lavitra ahy izany
But some love him.	misy tia azy anefa
I just stayed there.	nijanona teo fotsiny aho
And the next.	ary ny manaraka azy
Everyone there.	ireo olona rehetra tao
That’s all, he told me.	izany no zavadrehetra hoy izy tamiko
Looked almost.	nijery saika
Like things, you know, don’t make sense.	toy ny zavatra fantatrao tsy misy dikany
Yes, he knows it just as well.	eny fantany tsara toa azy koa izany
He just knew it.	fantany fotsiny izany
I should have done better.	tokony ho nanao tsara kokoa aho
In.	taminny
It goes without saying.	mandeha ho azy
And that was fun.	ary izany dia nahafinaritra
You must be crazy to do that.	tsy maintsy adala ianao raha manao izany
It seems to work as well.	toa miasa ihany koa
Now everything is going well.	ankehitriny dia mandeha tsara ny zavadrehetra
Something new.	zavatra vaovao
It may be a silly idea.	hevitra adala angamba ilay izy
That sounds like a good idea.	toa hevitra tsara ilay izy
And something else unusual.	ary zavatra hafa tsy mahazatra
No one has yet.	tsy mbola nisy olona
It became too crazy.	lasa adala loatra
He really meant a lot to me.	tena nisy dikany tamiko tokoa izy
And do well.	ary manao tsara
The process is a bit complicated.	somary sarotra ny dingana
He already got one.	efa nahazo iray izy
He could have done everything well.	afaka nanao tsara ny zavadrehetra
Probably not this year.	mety tsy aminity taona ity
The question of proximity is one of the facts.	ny fanontaniana momba ny antony akaiky dia iray aminny zavamisy
It needs no other.	tsy mila hafa izany
I'm really happy with this one.	tena faly aho aminity
It can be done a little more.	azo atao kely kokoa ilay izy
It doesn't matter to them.	tsy misy dikany aminizy ireo izany
It was really fun to see it.	tena nahafinaritra ny nahita izany
But there is another problem.	saingy misy olana iray hafa
I always get something out of it.	mahazo zavatra foana aho aminizany
Anything about him.	na inona na inona momba azy
He knew that was not true.	fantany fa tsy marina izany
There has never been a time like this before.	tsy nisy fotoana toy izany teo aloha
I want the same for you.	toy izany koa no tiako ho anao
It’s a car actually.	fiara io raha ny marina
This is not a new war.	tsy ady vaovao izany
They are both bad.	samy ratsy izy ireo
They will never come to earth.	tsy ho tonga aminny tany mihitsy izy ireo
Time has passed for that.	nandeha ny fotoana ho aminizany
But not all of this is true, even in part.	saingy tsy izany rehetra izany no marina na dia misy ampahany aza
But they have to be in the right place.	saingy tsy maintsy eo aminny toerana mety izy ireo
It’s a nonsense idea.	hevitra tsy misy dikany izany
Small money goes a long way.	ny vola kely dia mandeha lavitra
Glad you love him.	faly ianao tia azy
Thank you.	misaotra anao
He may be confused.	mety ho very hevitra izy
There was nothing wrong with that.	tsy nisy diso izany
The latter type should seem familiar to you.	ny karazana farany dia tokony ho toa mahazatra anao
I think you know the type.	heveriko fa fantatrao ilay karazana
However, it has been a long time coming.	na izany aza efa ela be ilay izy
It will not be an easy battle for them either.	tsy ho ady mora ho azy ireo koa izany
Everyone loves him.	tia azy daholo ny olona
A lot of time has passed.	be ny fotoana lasa
It will not be good.	tsy ho tsara izany
Which is really fun.	izay tena mahafinaritra
The war begins.	manomboka ny ady
Almost always there was.	saika nisy foana
In real life.	aminny tena fiainana
I don't really see anything.	tsy tena mahita na inona na inona
The other two people arrived.	tonga ireo olona roa hafa ireo
They haven’t done it yet.	mbola tsy nanao izany izy ireo
Still not good.	mbola tsy tsara
We were very happy with the final result.	tena faly izahay taminny vokatra farany
And there are times.	ary misy fotoana
He just can’t.	tsy afaka fotsiny izy
They are not very happy.	tsy dia faly izy ireo
There must be one !.	tsy maintsy misy iray
We have already started the war, he said.	efa nanomboka ny ady izahay hoy izy
And you will be sure of it.	ary ho azonao antoka izany
But the problem is not at all the problem.	saingy tsy ny olana mihitsy no olana
Someone is working here.	misy miasa eto
This is not true, of course.	tsy marina izany mazava ho azy
I know you need a special place.	fantatro fa mila toerana manokana ianao
Life is not easy, especially for women.	tsy mora ny fiainana indrindra ho anny vehivavy
Life is never easy.	tsy mora mihitsy ny fiainana
But he is now.	fa izy izao
Evil often follows.	matetika ny ratsy no manaraka
Not long ago everything was different.	tsy ela akory izay dia hafa ny zavadrehetra
You just don’t get it.	tsy azonao fotsiny
And that’s where the wrong begins.	ary eo no manomboka ny tsy mety
Both are true.	samy marina
If they do, they are crazy.	raha manao izany izy ireo dia adala
There is no need for them.	tsy misy ilaina aminizy ireo
It is never perfect.	tsy tanteraka mihitsy izany
You need to follow.	mila manaraka ianao
It’s more difficult now.	sarotra kokoa izany ankehitriny
I think he knows.	heveriko fa fantany
Some of them are really bad.	ny sasany aminizy ireo dia tena ratsy
Very real, very strong.	tena tena izy tena mafy
And you are not.	ary tsy izany ianao
But it is real.	tena misy anefa izany
But you have a bigger problem.	saingy manana olana lehibe kokoa ianao
All the way.	ny lalana rehetra
The next night.	ny alina manaraka
Because it was never a problem for me.	satria tsy nisy olana tamiko mihitsy izany
Now they are the same as themselves again.	ankehitriny izy ireo dia mitovy aminny tenany indray
Sometimes once.	indraindray indray mandeha
Sometimes it looks like a man.	indraindray dia toa lehilahy
But nothing can be done.	tsy misy azo atao anefa izany
All of this was completely meaningless.	tena tsy nisy dikany izany rehetra izany
I have stayed there before.	efa nijanona tany aho taloha
She could tell him he loved her without a word.	afaka nilaza taminy izy fa tia azy tsy misy teny
And of course he had.	ary mazava ho azy fa nanana
Hard and a bit ground.	mafy ary somary tany
They will not be here.	tsy ho eto izy ireo
I just made sure.	vao avy nanao antoka aho
Just like last time.	toy ny taminny fotoana farany ihany
They saw him a lot.	nahita azy be dia be izy ireo
Then the time came for me.	avy eo dia tonga amiko ny fotoana
We couldn’t do it at one time.	tsy afaka nanao izany taminny fotoana iray izahay
Either way, it’s been a long time coming.	na izany na tsy izany dia efa ela be izany
It's history.	efa tantara izany
Somewhat full at the bottom.	somary feno ao ambany
Sometimes it is even long dead.	indraindray aza dia efa ela no maty
They get results, and they get it fast.	mahazo vokatra izy ireo ary mahazo izany haingana
That should be a long way off.	tokony ho efa lavitra izany
I want you close to me.	tiako ianao akaiky ahy
It will not be easy.	tsy ho mora
You have another one to come.	misy iray hafa ho avy ianao
Only one.	afaka iray ihany
If they don’t need you anymore, you won’t be there.	raha tsy mila anao intsony izy ireo dia tsy hisy ianao
They will not be beautiful.	tsy ho tsara tarehy izy ireo
Will not do it.	dia tsy hanao izany
But that kind of guy doesn’t come very close.	saingy tsy tonga akaiky loatra io karazana lehilahy io
Just got it.	vao nahazo
I can walk too.	afaka mandeha koa aho
We already had it.	efa nanana izany izahay
The next one isn’t, it’s not.	ny manaraka dia tsy izany tsy izany
But you are not alone.	tsy ianao ihany anefa izany
They are always plentiful.	be dia be foana izy ireo
I know you're not.	fantatro fa tsy ianao
We are still free.	mbola afaka izahay
He is very talkative.	tena be resaka izy
We want to do the same.	te hanao toy izany koa izahay
Not if you looked at the other one.	tsy raha nijery ilay iray
Sometimes you are in the right place at the right time.	indraindray ianao dia eo aminny toerana mety aminny fotoana mety
It must be a fun place.	tsy maintsy ho toerana mahafinaritra izy io
They work easily.	miasa mora izy ireo
He should have looked at it himself.	tokony ho nijery izany ny tenany
I don't want to be alone.	tsy te ho irery aho
But they could be.	saingy mety ho izy ireo tokoa
I immediately recognized this house.	tonga dia fantatro io trano io
I know he exists.	fantatro fa misy izy
It should be small and simple.	tokony ho kely sy tsotra
Very close indeed.	tena akaiky tokoa
To me, it’s always been like that.	amiko dia toy izany foana
So you definitely don’t need a lot.	noho izany dia azo antoka fa tsy mila be dia be ianao
Like people couldn’t do without it.	toy ny olona tsy afaka nanao raha tsy nisy izany
I never looked at another woman.	tsy nijery vehivavy hafa mihitsy aho
Which is not often.	izay tsy matetika
He loves it here.	tiany eto
This is a difficult place for you.	toerana sarotra aminao izany
It was fun, you know.	nahafinaritra azy izany fantatrao
Maybe he won't come.	angamba tsy ho avy izy
There is one working for us now.	misy iray miasa ho anay izao
He did the same for me.	nanao izany tamiko koa izy
The bottom of the house.	ny ambany ny trano
However, it has become very hard.	na izany aza dia lasa mafy be
They were not played.	tsy natao lalao izy ireo
However, we always had fun.	na izany aza dia nahafinaritra foana izahay
Everything is very good right now.	tena tsara ny zavadrehetra aminizao fotoana izao
This place is very important.	zavadehibe indrindra io toerana io
In fact, there was only one.	raha ny marina iray ihany no nisy
Just a small problem.	olana kely fotsiny
He doesn't need it right now.	tsy mila izany izy aminizao fotoana izao
I want to be alone.	te ho irery aho
And you certainly don’t find anything fun.	ary azo antoka fa tsy mahita zavatra mahafinaritra ianao
Someone else will have to do it.	olona hafa no tsy maintsy hanao izany
But it turns out that's not the case.	saingy hita fa tsy izany no izy
Nothing is good at all.	tsy misy tsara mihitsy
You don’t want to do anything anymore.	tsy te hanao na inona na inona intsony ianao
The fact is no one.	ny zavamisy dia tsy misy olona
Things, however, are impossible.	ny zavatra anefa dia tsy azo atao
That is the end.	izay no farany
But here it doesn’t work.	fa eto dia tsy miasa
There must be a reason.	tsy maintsy misy antony
It’s so much fun now.	mahafinaritra be izao
Yet we all are.	na izany aza isika rehetra
But he is only one person.	olona iray ihany anefa izy
He is not happy either.	tsy faly koa izy
Same as before, same age.	mitovy aminny taloha ihany mitovy taona
Which was really fun.	izay tena nahafinaritra
Maybe it made some sense.	angamba nisy dikany tany ho any izany
You have gone and now you have come.	efa nandeha ianao ary tonga izao
There are people like me too.	misy olona toa ahy koa
He said simply.	tsotra hoy izy
Housing is the most difficult question.	ny trano no fanontaniana sarotra indrindra
It was fun to have none.	nahafinaritra ny tsy nisy
So it’s very special.	noho izany dia tena manokana
But it just got easier.	lasa mora kokoa anefa izany
Someone should have watched me.	tokony ho nisy nijery ahy
It’s not a pretty car.	tsy fiara tsara tarehy izany
I love non -stories, especially stories.	tiako ny tsy tantara indrindra ny tantara
Then he knew what it was.	dia fantany hoe inona izany
First, you are not the same.	voalohany tsy mitovy ianao
But it’s not a bad place, then.	saingy tsy toerana ratsy izany aminizany
There are a lot of important things.	betsaka ny zavadehibe
It’s all kind of pointless.	somary tsy misy dikany daholo izany
There are only two possibilities.	roa ihany ny mety ho azo atao
At night, the road is not clear.	aminny alina dia tsy hita tsara ny lalana
If you haven’t done so, you should.	raha tsy nanao izany ianao dia tokony
With money.	miaraka aminny vola
Because he is the only one there.	satria izy irery no misy
Don't do that.	aza manao toy izany
And it was really fun.	ary tena nahafinaritra izany
That is the only problem.	izay ihany no olana
They went before.	nandeha teo aloha izy ireo
I started to get excited.	nanomboka faly aho
But a lot of steps have been taken.	betsaka anefa ny dingana natao taminizany
You love money not work.	tianao ny vola fa tsy ny asa
Such a thing is not possible.	tsy azo atao ny zavatra toy izany
I think there may still be a future.	heveriko fa mety mbola hisy ny ho avy
The same goes for the other pictures.	toy izany koa ny sary hafa
This is the real man.	io no tena lehilahy
But there will be no war.	tsy hisy ady anefa
Not for the house.	tsy ho anny trano
There were other options available.	nisy safidy hafa azo natao
It takes some time.	mila fotoana kely izany
I know it may not be easy.	fantatro fa mety tsy ho mora izany
It seems to work.	toa miasa izany
And so you are the only one.	ary noho izany dia ianao irery ihany
But that is no longer necessary.	tsy ilaina izany intsony anefa
People are for them.	ho azy ireo ny olona
They become automatic.	lasa mandeha ho azy izy ireo
Things are new.	vaovao ny zavatra
Really, it seems like a lot.	tena toa be dia be
I will be a completely different person.	ho olona hafa tanteraka aho
We didn’t, of course.	tsy nanao izany izahay mazava ho azy
Maybe he still does.	mbola manao izany angamba
Soon, he thought.	tsy ela hoy izy nieritreritra
No, that word is wrong.	tsia diso izany teny izany
Like pictures, photos and other images.	toy ny sary sary ary sary hafa
I have a little problem here.	manana olana kely aho eto
That is enough.	izany hoe ampy
It is nothing but work alone.	tsy inona izany fa asa irery
Yes, the money stayed there.	eny nijanona teo ny vola
Or from me.	na avy amiko
That's simple.	izany no tsotra
They both really love him.	samy tia azy tokoa izy ireo
So this is the big problem.	ka izao no olana lehibe
First we thought about what could be done.	voalohany dia nieritreritra ny zavatra azo atao izahay
Yes, it doesn’t really matter.	eny tsy dia zavadehibe loatra izany
But we will certainly do so.	azo antoka anefa fa hanao izany isika
They can never be perfect.	tsy afaka ny ho tanteraka mihitsy izy ireo
Even if he had to.	na dia tsy maintsy nanao izany aza izy
Here is the story.	dia toy izao ny tantara
But not now.	tsy izao anefa
And that time must be near.	ary tsy maintsy ho efa akaiky io fotoana io
However, not all cars need them.	na izany aza tsy ny fiara rehetra no mila azy ireo
Of course he had an idea.	mazava ho azy fa nanana hevitra izy
No one gets everything.	tsy misy mahazo ny zavadrehetra
Worth a lot of money.	mendrika vola be
They enjoyed the fun.	nahafinaritra azy ireo ny nahafinaritra
But in all the wrong places.	fa aminny toerana tsy mety rehetra
I hope he comes.	manantena aho fa ho avy izy
The next one didn’t have.	ny manaraka dia tsy nanana
Whatever it is, the time has come.	na inona na inona izany tonga ny fotoana
He was better than usual.	tsara kokoa noho ny mahazatra izy
I think we did.	heveriko fa nanao izany isika
This is not an easy path.	tsy lalana mora izany
Many of them are beautiful.	maro aminizy ireo no tsara tarehy
But the worst is yet to come.	mbola ho avy anefa ny ratsy indrindra
I said yes.	hoy aho hoe eny
But it’s just a matter of style.	saingy resaka fomba fotsiny izany
He always loves you for a reason.	tia anao foana izy noho ny antony
That we may all be perfect at all times.	mba ho tonga tanteraka aminny fotoana rehetra isika rehetra
But, he did it in the end, and it was a lot of fun.	saingy nanao izany izy taminny farany ary nahafinaritra be
But you have to do it.	fa tokony hanao izany ianao
He should always be there.	tokony ho eo foana izy
There are so many good options out there.	misy safidy tsara be dia be any
There was no low workload.	tsy nisy asa ambany loatra
Maybe it was just a conversation.	resaka fotsiny angamba ilay izy
That should be normal.	tokony ho mahazatra izany
He needed time and space.	nila fotoana sy toerana izy
Otherwise, the picture is good.	raha tsy izany dia tsara ny sary
But that is not the case now.	saingy tsy izany no zavamisy ankehitriny
There is too much in it.	be loatra ny ao anatiny
It’s so much that it doesn’t make sense.	be loatra ka tsy misy dikany izany
There were no questions.	tsy nisy fanontaniana
I love everyone at the same time.	tiako ny olona rehetra aminny fotoana iray ihany
Now you don’t get it.	ankehitriny dia tsy azonao izany
But now it is full.	fa izao dia feno
You can be anything you want.	afaka ny ho na inona na inona tianao ianao
You look at him too much.	mijery azy loatra ianao
I was so happy to do it.	faly be aho nanao izany
He likes to walk fast.	tia mandeha haingana izy
We are all new to this world.	samy vaovao aminity tontolo ity isika
He always wanted to be good.	te ho tsara foana izy
And there were some.	ary nisy ny sasany
But he is not a real person.	tsy tena olona anefa
It’s not that they’re barren.	tsy hoe momba izy ireo
He knew that day would come.	fantany fa ho avy io andro io
That's enough, what's to come.	ampy izay izay ho avy
They are not the same, but the bottom is the same.	tsy mitovy izy ireo fa ny ambany dia mitovy
This is very familiar to me.	tena mahazatra ahy izany
I have a question.	manana fanontaniana iray aho
It needs the right people.	mila olona marina izany
There may be a way.	mety misy fomba
He makes you the highest of all.	izy no manao anao ho ambony indrindra aminny rehetra
Work harder.	miasa mafy kokoa
But he was alone and we were many.	irery anefa izy ary maro izahay
I know the place.	fantatro ilay toerana
All that money.	izany vola rehetra izany
One thing is true.	marina ny momba ny zavatra iray
I love it!!!.	tiako izy izany
He always went.	nandeha foana izy
You can't do anything here.	tsy afaka manao na inona na inona eto ianao
And you look crazy.	ary toa adala ianao
Just hard work.	asa mafy fotsiny
In fact, there wasn’t even one.	raha ny marina tsy nisy na dia iray aza
There is nothing worse than all this.	tsy misy zavatra ratsy kokoa noho izany rehetra izany
If there is, he is happy with it.	raha misy dia faly aminizany izy
He is unlike any other.	tsy toy ny hafa izy
This is one of those games.	io no iray aminireo lalao ireo
But he has it.	manana izany anefa izy
Done right.	nanao araka ny tokony ho izy
I think someone didn’t see the idea.	heveriko fa nisy olona tsy nahita ilay hevitra
If he likes these, so much the better.	raha tiany ireo dia tsara kokoa
They are the same as they are today.	izy ireo dia mitovy aminny ankehitriny
It is not a product.	tsy vokatra izany
He didn’t know what to do.	tsy fantany izay tokony ho izy
Time goes by too fast.	mandeha haingana loatra ny fotoana
Probably because they are always meaningless.	angamba satria tsy misy dikany foana izy ireo
He is looking to the future.	mijery ny ho avy izy
Someone is watching us there.	misy olona mijery anay ao
There was another woman there.	nisy vehivavy hafa teo
They don’t get there.	tsy tonga any izy ireo
The thing is great.	lehibe ilay zavatra

Very easy, very fun.	tena mora tena mahafinaritra

For some more than others.	ho anny sasany mihoatra noho ny hafa
And you really need me.	ary tena mila ahy ianao
This is not a first idea.	tsy hevitra voalohany izany
He liked the idea, of course.	tiany ilay hevitra mazava ho azy
Now he had a story.	ankehitriny dia nanana tantara izy
He must be wrong.	tsy maintsy ho diso hevitra izy
The lowest, in fact.	ny ambany indrindra raha ny marina
Didn't look too closely.	tsy nijery akaiky loatra
Even what he likes.	na ny tiany aza
That is not the case.	tsy izany no zavamisy
He might have just looked at me.	mety ho nijery ahy fotsiny izy
We just didn’t have it.	tsy nanana fotsiny izahay
But the latter.	fa ity farany ity
I think this is the best.	heveriko fa izao no tsara indrindra
It may not be that important, but it is.	mety ho tsy dia zavadehibe izany saingy izany no izy
And so it was.	ary dia toy izany no izy
The highest is work.	ny ambony indrindra dia ny asa
But they already had problems.	efa nanana olana anefa izy ireo
But after many years, he knew the way well.	rehefa afaka taona maro anefa dia fantany tsara ilay lalana

She still loves him.	mbola tia azy izy
However, we did nothing wrong.	na izany aza tsy nanao ratsy izahay

It’s as simple as it really is.	tsotra toy ny aminny fomba marina izany
And it's mine.	ary ahy izany

Whether everyone has it or not.	na manana izany ny tsirairay na tsy manana izany
Some of them are a must -see, and some are not.	ny sasany aminizy ireo dia tsy maintsy ho hita ary ny sasany tsy
I used to think that too.	nieritreritra izany koa aho taloha

It’s not necessary, and it’s not even necessary.	tsy ilaina izany ary tsy ilaina akory
And you never looked too far.	ary tsy nijery lavitra mihitsy ianao
These two issues seem to be very similar.	ireo olana roa ireo dia toa mitovy be

The thing is not very good.	tsy dia tsara loatra ilay zavatra
But there is more that can be done here.	mbola betsaka kokoa anefa ny azo atao eto
And, two people started it.	ary olona roa no nanomboka izany
You deserve it.	mendrika azy ianao
Harder, not better.	sarotra kokoa tsy tsara kokoa
He does whatever he wants.	manao izay rehetra tiany
I haven’t done them yet.	mbola tsy nanao azy ireo aho
I think so.	heveriko ary izy
Look good and possible.	jereo tsara sy azo atao
And a lot of people love it.	ary be dia be ny olona tia izany
They’re just great.	lehibe fotsiny izy ireo
I was glad to see them.	faly aho nahita azy ireo
And as before, they became one.	ary toy ny teo aloha dia lasa iray ihany izy ireo
It’s not always the same.	tsy mitovy foana
He will soon be better.	tsy ho ela dia ho tsara kokoa izy
He never seems to be seen.	toa tsy hita mihitsy izy
It really turned out to be fun.	tena hita fa mahafinaritra
It is too early to say.	mbola aloha loatra ny nilaza izany
You probably know many.	maro angamba no fantatrao
Yes, they do.	eny manao izany izy ireo
But they watched a lot.	saingy nijery be dia be izy ireo
It’s almost certain.	saika azo antoka izany
There was no end time.	tsy nisy fotoana farany
Kind of, though.	karazana na izany aza
If we are not close, we are not close.	raha tsy akaiky isika dia tsy akaiky
It was something else.	zavatra hafa ilay izy
This is made clear below.	izany dia atao mazava tsara eto ambany
And now it’s that simple.	ary aminizao fotoana izao dia tsotra izany
This woman got it in two ways.	ity vehivavy ity dia nahazo taminny fomba roa
He already knew they were dead.	efa fantany fa maty izy ireo
Everything did not go well.	tsy nandeha tsara ny zavadrehetra
They are for you.	ho anao izy ireo
But there’s nothing really fun about it.	saingy tsy misy na inona na inona tena mahafinaritra momba izany
Everything is yours.	anao izao rehetra izao
I just need the idea.	mila ny hevitra fotsiny aho
Very good again.	tena tsara indray
i have a little.	manana kely aho
I think this is a good time.	heveriko fa fotoana tsara izao
But, it doesn’t really work.	saingy tsy tena miasa izany
This is the worst thing.	ity no zavatra ratsy indrindra
I just thought.	vao avy nieritreritra aho
Each game is a new game.	ny lalao tsirairay dia lalao vaovao
It's like everything else in life.	toy ny zavatra hafa rehetra eo aminny fiainana izany
Just a word or two.	teny iray na roa fotsiny
It could be a one -time thing.	mety ho zavatra indray mandeha izany
Life is very good in general.	tena tsara ny fiainana aminny ankapobeny
In general, less is better.	aminny ankapobeny ny kely kokoa no tsara kokoa
They should know that.	tokony ho fantany izany
I just wasn’t made that way.	tsy natao toy izany fotsiny aho
No one saw me.	tsy nisy nahita ahy
But that’s not all.	saingy tsy izany no zavadrehetra
For me, it was very difficult.	ho ahy dia sarotra be izany
There is always good and bad.	misy foana ny tsara sy ny ratsy
You cannot be alone.	tsy afaka irery ianao
That's it, thanks !.	izay ihany misaotra
I love the event.	tiako ilay hetsika
The car is moving fast.	mandeha haingana ny fiara
They are not very talkative.	tsy dia be resaka izy ireo
And that doesn't make sense.	ary tsy misy dikany io resaka io
Fun, fun, fun !!!.	mahafinaritra mahafinaritra mahafinaritra
I love the fact.	tiako ny zavamisy
It’s important and it’s for you.	zavadehibe izany ary ho anao izany
Three days and three nights.	telo andro sy telo alina
In the picture only.	aminny sary ihany
This is not a pretty picture.	tsy sary tsara tarehy izany
It was specially made.	natao manokana izany
We want to be.	te ho isika
But there are many, many more options out there.	saingy misy safidy maro maro hafa any
This is very common for many.	tena mahazatra ny maro izany
I hope this is not the case.	manantena aho fa tsy izany no izy
He doesn't want money for himself, he said.	tsy tiany ny vola ho anny tenany hoy ihany izy
I don't think you get it.	heveriko fa tsy ho azonao izany
There was another reason, very specific.	nisy antony hafa tena manokana
The worst result for me.	ny vokatra ratsy indrindra ho ahy
There is no real reason.	tsy misy antony marina
Because you are crazy.	satria adala
Watch this story.	jereo ity tantara ity
But he does it to everyone.	fa manao izany aminny rehetra izy
Here's a simple way.	ity misy fomba tsotra
This person has a good idea.	manana hevitra tsara io olona io
Things like the latter are where I am.	ny zavatra toy ity farany ity dia ny toerana misy ahy
There is nothing for him here.	tsy misy na inona na inona ho azy eto
No one else could have done so much.	tsy nisy olona afaka nanao be toy izany
A little nonsense.	zavatra kely tsy misy dikany
I didn’t look at him too closely.	tsy nijery azy akaiky loatra aho
This is not for you at all.	tsy mety aminao mihitsy izany
This is not news.	tsy izany no vaovao
Finally he found one.	farany dia nahita iray izy
Unlike some.	tsy toy ny sasany
Here this is not possible.	eto dia tsy azo atao izany
It’s fun to work, no matter what the job.	mahafinaritra ny miasa na inona na inona asa
Soon, he said, soon.	tsy ho ela hoy izy tsy ho ela
A very beautiful woman, and a beautiful man.	vehivavy iray tena tsara tarehy ary lehilahy tsara tarehy
Or it could be.	na mety ho izany
But good comes from evil.	fa ny tsara dia avy aminny ratsy
I need these conversations.	mila ireo resaka ireo aho
Not only for herself, but for other women as well.	tsy ho anny tenany ihany fa ho anny vehivavy hafa koa
So not much here.	ka tsy dia betsaka eto
Probably not much.	mety tsy dia betsaka
This next part will be difficult.	ity ampahany manaraka ity dia ho sarotra
But they are not easy.	tsy mora anefa izy ireo
Now the game is different.	aminizao fotoana izao dia hafa ny lalao
Everything is too small.	kely loatra ny zavadrehetra
And he did a good job of it.	ary nanao asa tsara izy taminizany
Not the first.	tsy ny voalohany
When you do, you will do better.	rehefa manao izany ianao dia hanao tsara kokoa
But he found another way.	nahita fomba hafa anefa izy
We don't see either.	tsy mahita koa isika
It used to be, but now.	teo aloha izany fa izao
I saw the woman, but she died.	hitako ilay vehivavy saingy maty izy
This, for one.	ity ho anny iray
The women seemed very happy and excited.	toa faly sy faly tokoa ireo vehivavy
They may be wrong.	diso hevitra angamba izy ireo
We are very far from the action.	lavitra be izahay aminny hetsika
Anyway, he enjoyed it.	na izany na tsy izany nahafinaritra azy ilay izy
Then he saw me.	avy eo izy vao nahita ahy
But you go really fast.	fa mandeha tena haingana ianao
It’s really not worth it.	tena tsy mendrika izany
In fact, this is the best.	raha ny marina dia io no tsara indrindra
I hope we don’t do that again.	manantena aho fa tsy hanao izany intsony isika
Not tonight.	tsy aminity alina ity
It's one o'clock.	aminny iray izy izao
There is such a thing.	misy toy izany
There was no food.	tsy nisy sakafo
Of course, there were many bad things.	mazava ho azy fa nisy zavatra ratsy maro
Absolutely wrong.	tena diso tokoa
The problem is as follows.	ny olana dia toy izao manaraka izao
Whatever it is it works.	na inona na inona izany dia miasa
I like history.	tiako ny tantara
I don’t know some of that.	tsy fantatro ny sasany aminireo
Very easy and convenient.	tena mora sy mety
And you can't either.	ary ianao koa tsy afaka
I think there are a lot of problems with that.	amiko dia betsaka ny olana aminizany
This is because of something else.	izany dia noho ny zavatra hafa
But there was no time.	saingy tsy nisy fotoana
But it will get there.	fa ho tonga any
Then it becomes easier.	avy eo dia lasa mora kokoa izy
And he said unto me, Yea.	ary hoy izy tamiko eny
I don’t think there will ever be.	heveriko fa tsy hisy mihitsy
Nothing, but a little.	tsy na inona na inona fa kely
There was always conversation.	nisy foana ny resaka
He sees the world at all times.	mijery izao tontolo izao aminny fotoana rehetra izy
But he did not look around.	tsy nijery ny manodidina anefa izy
He was thinking of something.	nieritreritra zavatra izy
Yes, much more than that.	eny mihoatra lavitra noho izany
But they are no small matter.	tsy zavatra kely anefa izy ireo
Others, not too much.	ny hafa tsy dia be loatra
But look at him carefully.	fa jereo tsara izy
He knew the man well.	fantany tsara io lehilahy io
Everything around me told me it was bad.	ny zavatra rehetra manodidina ahy dia nilaza tamiko fa ratsy izany
The day went by really fast.	nandeha haingana tokoa io andro io
Out of nowhere came something.	avy aminny tsy misy dia nisy zavatra
Some don’t have much at first.	ny sasany dia tsy manana zavatra betsaka aminny voalohany
One day there.	indray andro any izao
Because they are happier.	satria faly kokoa izy ireo
We are just full people.	olona feno fotsiny isika
Or something.	na zavatra iray
Which is probably more appropriate.	izay angamba no mety kokoa
Many, many jobs.	maro asa maro
It was a real fight.	tena ady izany
Apparently it was the same.	hita fa iray ihany ilay izy
Already in the past.	efa taminny lasa
Something not too low.	zavatra tsy dia ambany loatra
This action is as follows.	ity hetsika ity dia toy izao manaraka izao
But that idea is just an idea.	hevitra fotsiny anefa io hevitra io
There are other reasons.	misy antony hafa tokoa
It’s from another time.	avy aminny fotoana hafa izany
There could be better games as well.	mety hisy lalao tsara kokoa koa
You have it now.	efa azonao izy izao
Finally, he stopped.	farany nijanona izy
It’s a big step for the best.	dingana lehibe ho anny tsara indrindra izany
Absolutely simple and very manly.	tsotra tanteraka ary tena lehilahy
He needs to see.	mila mahita izy
And in that he was absolutely right.	ary taminizany dia marina tanteraka izy
This is only the first step.	dingana voalohany ihany io
Which, of course, may not make sense.	izay mazava ho azy dia mety tsy hisy dikany
I am very happy with that.	faly be aho aminizany
Quick, don’t look around.	haingana aza mijery manodidina
Everything still went well for them.	mbola nandeha tsara ho azy ireo ny zavadrehetra
We both had a great time.	samy nanana fotoana tsara izahay
It’s really the end.	tena farany izany
Not done in any way.	tsy natao taminny fomba rehetra
I don't see any such results.	tsy mahita vokatra toy izany aho
Beautiful surroundings of the house.	tsara tarehy manodidina ny trano
Generally it will be very small.	aminny ankapobeny dia ho kely dia kely izany
You have a problem.	manana olana ianao
But the idea is the same.	saingy mitovy ihany ny hevitra
It is for them.	ho azy ireo tokoa izany
Time goes by but it doesn’t come.	mandeha ny fotoana fa tsy tonga
One day I.	indray andro aho
He was already dead when we arrived.	efa maty izy rehefa tonga izahay
We have never seen anything like them.	mbola tsy nahita ny toa azy ireo izahay
But without one, we can do nothing.	saingy raha tsy misy iray dia tsy afaka manao na inona na inona isika
At first it was fun.	taminny voalohany dia nahafinaritra
He was only three overall.	telo ihany izy taminny ankapobeny
It’s all about the game, of course.	ny momba ny lalao rehetra mazava ho azy
The other became confused.	lasa very hevitra ilay hafa
This moment is very real.	tena marina ity fotoana ity
I've seen this before.	efa nahita anio aho taloha
Maybe not at all.	angamba tsy ny rehetra
Do it if you want !.	ataovy izany raha tianao
Somewhat like that.	somary toy izany
We are happy to be together here.	faly isika miaraka eto
You should be there.	tokony ho eo ianao
It was selfish to him.	tia tena taminy izany
I can't look.	tsy afaka mijery aho
That’s often the case, these days.	toy izany matetika aminizao andro izao
And they’re not really a problem.	ary tsy tena olana akory izy ireo
But not everyone does.	tsy ny rehetra anefa no manao izany
But that is not the whole story.	tsy izany anefa no tantara feno
That part seems to be true.	toa marina io ampahany io
I don't see you often.	tsy mahita anao matetika aho
It was like another world.	toy ny tontolo hafa ilay izy
There are two main effects.	misy vokatra lehibe roa
And maybe not so long ago.	ary angamba tsy ela izay
So it should do what you want.	noho izany dia tokony hanao izay tianao izany
So far away.	any lavitra any
But he alone.	fa izy irery ihany
Then you are the only one who is sure.	dia ianao ihany no tena azo antoka
I love this story.	tiako io tantara io
Make sure you get one !.	ataovy azo antoka fa mahazo iray
If you haven’t done so, check it out first.	raha tsy nanao izany ianao dia jereo aloha
But now it is different.	hafa anefa izao
Such a wonderful man.	lehilahy mahafinaritra toy izany
And it’s very easy to do the wrong thing.	ary tena mora ny manao ny tsy mety
Still not right.	mbola tsy mety ihany
What works for some people may not work for others.	izay mety aminny olona sasany dia tsy mety aminny hafa
And now he had.	ary izao dia nanana
It is impossible not to do so.	tsy azo atao ny tsy manao izany
There wasn’t much.	tsy nisy loatra
But no one is watching us.	tsy misy mijery anay anefa
One thing was better for him.	zavatra iray no tsara kokoa taminy
You said it was too easy.	nilaza ianao fa mora loatra izany
When we get the news.	rehefa mahazo ny vaovao izahay
He is safe now.	azo antoka izy izao
All because of time.	rehetra noho ny fotoana
They don’t deserve any better.	tsy mendrika ny tsara kokoa izy ireo
There for everyone.	eo ho anny tsirairay
And maybe another one.	ary angamba iray hafa
That's all.	izany fotsiny no izy
It should and works all the time.	tokony ary miasa aminny fotoana rehetra izany
I went there sometimes.	nandeha tany aho indraindray
You have more time.	manana fotoana bebe kokoa ianao
They died because of it.	maty noho izany izy ireo
He knew he loved it.	fantany fa tiany izany
He knew it didn’t make sense.	fantany fa tsy misy dikany izany
You know you do.	fantatrao fa manao izany ianao
But there is no question for me now.	saingy tsy misy resaka amiko izao
In that case, he is close.	aminizany dia akaiky izy
Even if he knew.	na raha fantany aza
Because it is for him.	satria ho azy izy
Maybe many can.	angamba maro no afaka
I haven't seen him yet.	mbola tsy hitako izy
Maybe I don’t like it.	mety tsy tiako izany
And she said it was beautiful.	ary nilaza izy fa tsara tarehy
I still haven’t thought anything about it.	mbola tsy nieritreritra na inona na inona momba izany aho
The words were the same for everyone.	mitovy ny teny teo aminny tsirairay
He always did what he wanted.	nanao izay tiany foana izy
But it is free and possible.	saingy afaka izany ary azo atao
Do the right thing for yourself too.	ataovy ho anao koa ny zavatra tsara
And you’re still beautiful, just different, that’s all.	ary mbola tsara tarehy ianao hafa fotsiny izay ihany
Do both.	ataovy izay roa
It’s a very real fact.	tena zavamisy marina
I work alone, thank you very much.	miasa irery aho misaotra indrindra
Busy here.	be atao eto
There are so many options.	be dia be ny safidy
It’s time for a big event.	fotoana ho anny hetsika lehibe izao
It is a personal choice.	safidy manokana io
Then it was obvious.	dia hita tokoa izany
These problems remained.	ireo olana ireo dia nijanona
I thought of something.	nieritreritra zavatra aho
And we had time.	ary nanana fotoana izahay
But everyone.	fa ny tsirairay
I do this often.	manao izany matetika aho
It was a tough fight.	ady mafy ilay izy
In the past, that was all that was needed.	taloha dia izay ihany no ilaina
This is a first for him.	ity no voalohany ho azy
In the real world.	ao aminny tontolo tena izy
Look closely.	jereo akaiky
The place is already full.	efa feno ny toerana

You start easy.	manomboka mora ianao
I don’t expect a day like that to come.	tsy manantena aho fa ho avy ny andro toy izany
But it is a difficult task.	asa sarotra anefa izany
Or that he even thought.	na hoe nieritreritra mihitsy izy
That’s fine, that’s what it should be.	tsara izany izany no tokony ho izy
There he was.	tao no nisy azy
He looked at her closely.	nijery azy akaiky izy
The question is below.	ny fanontaniana dia eto ambany
It’s not so clear that I don’t like it.	tsy dia mazava loatra fa tsy tiako izany
We certainly got the choice.	azo antoka fa nahazo ny safidy izahay
But he didn’t tell me.	saingy tsy nilaza tamiko izy
He is very much like me.	tena mitovy amiko izy
But it’s all good.	saingy tsara daholo izany
Three more, that's all.	telo hafa izay ihany
It seems like life itself, to me.	toa toy ny fiainana mihitsy amiko
He did it even though he didn’t like it.	nanao izany izy na dia tsy tiany aza
That would be great.	tena tsara raha izany
Or many thought.	na maro no nieritreritra
But, not all is lost.	saingy tsy very daholo
You could not have done wrong.	tsy afaka nanao ratsy ianao
In fact, they are ugly.	raha ny marina dia ratsy tarehy izy ireo
We are going well.	mandeha tsara isika
We did nothing, in fact.	tsy nanao na inona na inona izahay raha ny marina
We are not alone in this.	tsy irery isika aminizany
If that is the question.	raha izay no fanontaniana
But they may not go very far.	mety tsy ho tonga lavitra anefa izy ireo
Not so recently.	tsy dia vao haingana
Anyway, they love me.	na izany na tsy izany tia ahy izy ireo
It has happened in the past.	efa nisy koa izany taloha
Make it fun too.	ataovy mahafinaritra koa izany
Really, don’t.	tena aza atao

He’s really together.	tena miaraka izy
We both have to work on something.	samy tsy maintsy miasa aminny zavatra iray izahay
Not really, but close.	tsy tena marina fa akaiky
Such an idea is generally possible.	ny hevitra toy izany dia azo atao aminny ankapobeny

And he did something.	ary nanao zavatra izy
Tonight is one of those nights.	iray aminireo alina ireo ny anio alina
I like simple food in general.	tiako ny sakafo tsotra aminny ankapobeny
I haven't seen the game yet.	mbola tsy hitako ilay lalao

I know you are a good man.	fantatro fa lehilahy tsara ianao

It may have been hard work.	asa mafy angamba ilay izy
You will not do evil.	tsy hanao ratsy ianao
Probably didn’t do anything for the best.	angamba tsy nanao na inona na inona ho ny tsara indrindra
That’s where everything is.	ao no misy ny zavadrehetra
This is one of the others.	ity dia iray aminireo hafa

No other man could do that.	tsy nisy lehilahy hafa afaka nanao izany
Not too much there.	tsy dia betsaka loatra ny any
We can do the best or the worst.	afaka manao ny tsara indrindra na ny ratsy indrindra isika
It is an essential part of life.	ampahany tena ilaina aminny fiainana izany

In a small way.	aminny kely

Just time.	fotoana fotsiny
It is no longer full.	tsy feno intsony
We can all have it.	afaka mahazo izany isika rehetra
This is because it is only one event.	izany dia satria hetsika iray ihany izany

The news is not very good.	tsy dia tsara loatra ilay vaovao
You may have had one too.	mety efa nanana iray koa ianao

But that did not happen.	tsy tonga tany anefa izany
And that was only the first trip.	ary izay ihany no dia voalohany
And it really is.	ary tena izany tokoa

Because it’s good.	satria tsara izany
He got the news.	nahazo ny vaovao izy
This seems more accurate.	toa marina kokoa izany
Neither is he.	tsy izy ihany koa

We should be in the present.	tokony ho aminizao fotoana izao isika
Look and see.	jereo ka jereo

It belongs to women.	anny vehivavy izany
It’s yours, personally.	anao io manokana
I don’t think we want to do that.	heveriko fa tsy te hanao izany isika
But because they got money.	saingy noho izy ireo nahazo vola
You do a good job with them, you know.	manao asa tsara miaraka aminizy ireo ianao fantatrao
Maybe he didn’t need a car.	angamba tsy nila fiara izy

You never know him.	tsy fantatrao mihitsy izy
Not much was found.	tsy nisy zavatra betsaka hita

They are very important.	tena zavadehibe izy ireo
There are some jobs.	misy asa sasany
The results are the same no matter what.	mitovy ny vokatra na inona na inona

It was ugly and beautiful.	ratsy sy tsara tarehy ilay izy
I think we have a very good result.	heveriko fa manana vokatra tena tsara isika
I almost immediately fell in love with him.	saika tonga dia tia azy aho
It’s like you got it.	toy ny hoe nahazo izany ianao

Too much but no need for money.	be loatra fa tsy mila vola
People die there.	maty ny olona any
There is always one.	misy foana ny iray
Make sure they are completely filled.	ataovy azo antoka fa feno tanteraka izy ireo
This is very good news.	tena vaovao tsara tokoa izany

But it is very simple, and it will not be long.	tena tsotra anefa izy io ka tsy ho ela
He doesn’t work for me anymore.	tsy miasa amiko intsony izy
He will not do wrong.	tsy hanao ny tsy marina izy
You are often much better than that.	matetika ianao no tsara lavitra noho izany
I will definitely be there for that.	tena ho any aho noho izany
He must be there.	tsy maintsy ho eo izy
That seems to be the easy part.	izany no toa ny ampahany mora
In fact, he said nothing.	raha ny marina dia tsy nilaza na inona na inona izy
It’s not that I just need it.	tsy hoe mila ahy fotsiny izany
Yes, even if they have bad words.	eny na dia misy teny ratsy aza izy ireo
It starts working.	manomboka miasa izany
We are not like them.	tsy mitovy aminizy ireo isika
He seems to be alone.	toa irery izy
That’s about the top options.	izany no momba ny safidy ambony
This is a bad time.	fotoana ratsy izany
But it was more fun than work.	nahafinaritra kokoa noho ny asa anefa izany
I don’t like them.	tsy tiako izy ireo
This is not the best, no.	tsy izao no tsara indrindra tsia
I might need it, in fact.	mety mila izany aho raha ny marina
It is also very important.	tena ilaina koa izany
Now we had.	ankehitriny dia nanana
It's going now.	efa mandeha izao
But it still exists.	mbola misy anefa izany

Nothing else works.	tsy misy zavatra hafa miasa
If anything, it seems.	raha misy dia toa
He had a beautiful idea.	nanana hevitra tsara tarehy izy
And maybe he’s not the last.	ary angamba tsy izy no farany
It might just make sense to you.	mety misy dikany aminao fotsiny izany
They did it once.	nanao izany indray mandeha izy ireo
Or if you’re doing something like that on your own.	na raha manao zavatra toy ny anao irery ianao
It’s not the money.	tsy ny vola izany
But the idea is not worth it.	tsy mendrika anefa io hevitra io
I enjoyed every moment of it.	nahafinaritra ahy ny fotoana rehetra taminizany
It couldn’t be a worse choice.	tsy mety ho safidy ratsy kokoa izany
It’s not worth it, he thought.	tsy mendrika izany hoy izy nieritreritra
I hope that's the only problem.	manantena aho fa izay ihany no olana
Too different, too new.	hafa loatra vaovao loatra
When he arrives.	rehefa tonga izy
And he will lose it again.	ary ho very azy indray izy

Of course it’s really fun.	mazava ho azy fa tena mahafinaritra

Everything is going well.	mandeha tsara ny rehetra
It went well at first.	nandeha tsara izany taminny voalohany
But you have to go.	tsy maintsy mandeha anefa ianao
From another world.	avy aminny tontolo hafa
Do what is necessary.	ataovy izay ilaina
There was another man inside.	nisy lehilahy hafa tao anatiny
He loves me and needs me.	tia ahy izy ary mila ahy
We are always far away.	lavitra be foana isika
And yes, history is meaningless.	ary eny tsy misy dikany ny tantara
But he is not happy.	fa tsy faly izy
You get the picture.	azonao ny sary
Mine too.	ny ahy koa
It was fast, not fun.	haingana izany tsy nahafinaritra
And, in fact, it doesn’t matter.	ary raha ny marina tsy zavadehibe izany
And we hope so too.	ary manantena izany koa izahay
Yes, not all of them.	eny tsy izy rehetra
And it wasn’t the first day.	ary tsy izany no andro voalohany
But two things are different.	zavatra roa anefa no samy hafa
Not getting enough.	tsy mahazo ampy
Now, you might be wrong.	ankehitriny mety ho diso ianao

I could have done it, easily.	afaka nanao ahy mora
That's not all.	tsy izy rehetra akory izany
But it has to be.	tsy maintsy ho izany anefa
Usually not.	matetika tsy

It doesn’t make sense otherwise.	tsy misy dikany izany raha tsy izany
Which is not a problem, usually.	izay tsy olana matetika
I stopped working.	nijanona taminny asa aho
There are many others that are fun as well.	misy maro hafa koa izay mahafinaritra

You can see everything.	afaka mahita ny zavadrehetra ianao
Everything else is an endless place.	ny hafa rehetra dia toerana tsy misy farany
Then we can start watching.	avy eo dia afaka manomboka mijery isika

And it is possible.	ary azo atao izany
And he looked at it.	dia nijery izany izy
It’s good, but it’s not enough.	tsara ilay izy saingy tsy ampy izany
Not at the time.	tsy taminizany fotoana izany
No, we don’t want to do that.	tsia tsy te hanao izany izahay
You really need something easier.	tena mila zavatra mora kokoa ianao
He died about two years ago.	roa taona teo ho eo izay no maty izy
We both had some.	samy nanana ny sasany izahay
He should do something for her.	tokony hanao zavatra ho azy izy
Check it out here.	jereo eto izany
And that’s something else.	ary zavatra hafa izany
But one thing is for sure.	saingy zavatra iray no tena azo antoka
Sometimes some can be difficult.	indraindray dia mety ho sarotra ny sasany
My favorite word.	teny tiako indrindra
You made a choice.	nanao safidy ianao
They are difficult.	sarotra izy ireo
People often do that.	matetika ny olona no manao izany
I want to do it all again.	te hanao izany rehetra izany indray aho
However, this may not be the case.	na izany aza mety tsy izany no izy
And they are wrong.	ary diso izy ireo
You look happy.	toa faly ianao

I said, once.	hoy aho hoe indray mandeha
You can watch as you like.	afaka mijery araka izay tianao

You could not go.	tsy afaka nandeha ianao
A new world is seen.	tontolo vaovao no hita
What kind of food do you like.	karazana sakafo tianao
Not only that, he said.	tsy izay ihany hoy izy
But he has a private home.	manana trano manokana anefa izy
He had to start all over again.	tsy maintsy nanomboka indray izy
No one was so good.	tsy nisy olona tsara toy izany
They are very tough.	tena mafy izy ireo
First of all, it took a lot of work.	voalohany indrindra nila asa be izany
It’s crazy fun.	mahafinaritra adala izany
But only for now.	fa aminizao fotoana izao ihany
Women are women.	vehivavy no vehivavy

We are both here.	samy eto isika
There was really no choice.	tena tsy nisy safidy
A woman he loves.	vehivavy tiany
You know people.	fantatrao ny olona
That is our problem.	izany no olana mahazo antsika
However, we were completely alone.	na izany aza dia irery tanteraka izahay
Every day is a battle for them.	ady ho azy ireo ny andro tsirairay
Because it does.	satria manao izany
It’s not easy, but it seems possible.	tsy mora izany fa toa azo atao
Not far from the house.	tsy lavitra ny trano
Probably the wrong part.	angamba ampahany diso
No one can have it.	tsy misy olona afaka manana izany
I found him to be very useful.	hitako fa tena ilaina tokoa izy
However, there was a lot of it.	na izany aza dia nisy be dia be izany
He had to act very quickly.	tsy maintsy nanao zavatra haingana be izy
It will be just like the old days.	ho toy ny taminny andro taloha izany
So we do something similar for everyone.	noho izany dia manao zavatra toy izany ho anny tsirairay izahay
But it never seems like the right time.	saingy toa tsy toy ny fotoana mety mihitsy izany
Overall happy with that.	aminny ankapobeny dia faly taminizany
It was the biggest event of the year.	io no hetsika lehibe indrindra taminny taona
He can make me my own.	izy dia afaka manao ahy manokana
But she is not yet so beautiful.	tsy mbola tsara tarehy toy izany anefa izy
Anyway, we are still small.	na izany na tsy izany mbola kely izahay
You know I’m just a night out alone.	fantatrao fa alina fotsiny aho irery
Small, seemingly insignificant, but there is.	kely toa tsy misy dikany fa misy
They are important.	zavadehibe izy ireo
She loved the trip.	tiany ilay dia
I will definitely do them again.	tena hanao azy ireo indray aho
He will not be alone.	tsy ho izy irery ihany
We can all go.	afaka mandeha isika rehetra
So, he said.	noho izany hoy izy
Just good work.	asa tsara fotsiny
I'm fine too.	mety koa aho
But this is not foolish either.	tsy adala koa anefa izany
Just go.	mandeha fotsiny
And that is one of the problems.	ary izany no iray aminireo olana
You may be lost here.	mety ho very eto ianao
Money doesn’t matter.	tsy misy dikany ny vola
You, in words.	ianao aminny teny izy
The two seem to be very different.	toa samy hafa be izy roa
We were there for two days.	roa andro izahay no tao
We are all very happy about that.	faly be izahay rehetra aminizany
We then do that.	manao izany izahay avy eo
I still really do.	mbola tena manao izany aho
Everything could have happened.	mety ho nisy ny zavadrehetra
I did it, but at a young age.	nanao izany aho saingy taminny mbola kely
Now, that's what it will do.	ankehitriny izany no hanao izany
They are just for everyone.	natao ho anny tsirairay fotsiny izy ireo
If you see anything, it could be money.	raha mahita na inona na inona ianao dia mety ho vola izany
I needed it for myself.	nila ho ahy aho
We always thought it might be possible.	nieritreritra foana izahay hoe mety ho azo atao izany
Some people may lose their jobs.	mety ho very asa ny olona sasany
Very convenient and easy to find.	tena mety sy mora hita
The words in it seem too good if not true.	toa tsara loatra ny teny ao aminy raha tsy marina
They were there.	tao izy ireo
It is easy and not difficult.	mora sy tsy sarotra izy
I don’t think he got to that point yet.	heveriko fa mbola tsy tonga taminizany izy
I have never done such a job.	tsy nanao asa toy izany mihitsy aho
It is night.	efa alina ny andro
For you personally, if not for him.	ho anao manokana raha tsy ho azy
He did not want to be mistaken.	tsy te ho diso hevitra izy
Everyone must have enough to eat.	tsy maintsy ho ampy sakafo ny tsirairay
It can also be an impossible action.	mety ho hetsika tsy azo atao ihany koa izany
In fact, it’s not the only word.	raha ny marina tsy io ihany no teny
Very crazy.	tena adala be
I think that’s the better way.	heveriko fa izany no fomba tsara kokoa
He did a good job.	nanao asa tsara izy
Food will also be a problem.	ho olana koa ny sakafo
And so he went.	ary toy izany dia lasa izy
To me it was a house.	ho ahy dia trano izany
Everything, it all became real.	ny zavadrehetra izany rehetra izany dia lasa tena izy
It’s all fun to see.	mahafinaritra daholo ny mahita azy
It’s not true that you get the idea.	tsy marina fa azonao ny hevitra
Life goes on.	mandeha ny fiainana
First of all.	voalohany manokana
They really did.	tena nanao izany tokoa izy ireo
I can't do anything else.	tsy afaka manao zavatra hafa aho
He did more than that.	nanao mihoatra noho izany izy
And the conversation.	ary ny resaka
Such a thing is meaningless.	ny zavatra toy izany dia tsy misy dikany
I needed food.	nila sakafo aho
It was a difficult year.	taona sarotra izany
I hope he did.	manantena aho fa nanao izany izy
He didn’t always think first.	tsy nieritreritra foana aloha izy
I already had enough.	efa nanana ny ampy aho
It was very different then.	hafa mihitsy izany taminizany
Almost any other work can be done anywhere.	saika ny asa hafa rehetra dia azo atao aminny toerana rehetra
There had to be something else in it all.	tsy maintsy nisy zavatra hafa taminizany rehetra izany
But that doesn't work for you.	tsy mety aminao anefa izany
Well, that’s not the only reason, of course.	eny tsy izany ihany no antony mazava ho azy
This work is not meant for one person.	ity asa ity dia tsy natao ho anny olona iray
We will come here.	ho avy eto isika
I don't even know you.	tsy fantatro akory ianao
I find that it works well.	hitako fa mandeha tsara izany
It’s all for them.	izany rehetra izany dia ho azy ireo
He already existed.	efa nisy izy
Not all men can be like that.	tsy mety ho toy izany ny lehilahy rehetra
The wrong is still wrong.	mbola tsy mety ny tsy mety
But he never said anything.	tsy nilaza mihitsy anefa izy
But that is not the only reality.	tsy izany ihany anefa no zavamisy
Yes, there are pictures.	eny misy sary
She is as beautiful as ever, and hers.	tsara tarehy toy ny taloha izy ary azy
It's just a question.	fanontaniana fotsiny io
Clearly you are one.	mazava fa iray ianao
The place is busy.	be atao ilay toerana
Some of them may even be true.	mety ho marina mihitsy aza ny sasany aminizy ireo
No, very bad.	tsia tena ratsy
Either way, it wouldn’t be easier than that.	na izany na tsy izany tsy ho mora kokoa noho izany
But anything can be done, he said.	fa na inona na inona azo atao hoy izy
People seem to be going crazy.	toa lasa adala ny olona
However, this is not enough.	na izany aza izany dia tsy ampy
Not too far here.	tsy dia lavitra loatra eto
He really had.	tena nanana izy
This is just one of many.	iray aminireo maro ihany izany
But he said nothing.	tsy nilaza na inona na inona anefa izy
He didn't even have a car.	tsy nanana fiara akory izy
But it is near.	efa akaiky anefa ilay izy
To be away from home.	mba ho lavitra ny trano
But it does not come alone.	tsy tonga irery anefa izany
No worse than that.	tsy ratsy kokoa noho izany izany
It’s harder now, then you are.	sarotra kokoa izao dia izao ianao
It was never complete.	tsy feno mihitsy ilay izy
Overall, a nice home.	aminny ankapobeny trano mahafinaritra
But in reality, they do.	saingy raha ny tena izy dia manao izany izy ireo
But because people love them.	saingy noho ny olona tia azy ireo
This is difficult for all of us.	sarotra ho antsika rehetra izany
But maybe that’s not crazy.	fa angamba tsy adala izany
He is very clear.	mazava be izy
You don't always want to be happy.	tsy te ho faly foana akory
Necessary, necessary, necessary.	ilaina ilaina ilaina
I never told him that.	tsy nilaza izany taminy mihitsy aho
Don’t make it important.	aza atao zavadehibe izany
he is ours.	anay izy
It turns out that they are very different.	hita fa tena samy hafa izy ireo
A little of it.	ny kely aminizany
From women and men.	avy aminny vehivavy sy ny lehilahy
To be real.	mba ho tena
But some do not see it.	misy anefa tsy mahita izany
A lot of good has been done.	be dia be ny tsara natao
There’s that in there.	misy aminizany ao
Yes, it has or not.	eny efa nisy izany na tsia
The next thing you know we were the first.	ny zavatra manaraka fantatrao dia teo aloha indrindra izahay
Thank you, it’s fun.	misaotra anao mahafinaritra izany
They said it could be at any time.	nilaza izy ireo fa mety ho aminny fotoana rehetra izany
But for you, enough.	fa ho anao ampy
Not really, but there you are.	tsy marina fa eo ianao
It works properly.	miasa araka ny tokony ho izy izany
Not working well right now.	tsy mandeha tsara aminizao fotoana izao
This is not a war for me.	tsy ady amiko izao
But so are we.	fa toy izany koa isika
He already knew that very well.	efa fantany tsara izany
Nothing is harder than that.	tsy misy sarotra noho izany
In fact, we have more than that.	raha ny marina dia manana mihoatra noho izany isika
It’s not some kind of picture either.	tsy karazana sary ihany koa
There is nothing special about it.	tsy misy zavatra manokana ao aminy mihitsy
They will no longer exist.	tsy hisy intsony izy ireo
Questions about self.	fanontaniana momba ny tena
In fact, he has a way of doing it.	raha ny marina dia manana lalana izy aminizany
He must be a busy man.	tsy maintsy ho lehilahy be atao izy
And now it’s gone.	ary izao dia tsy misy intsony
Here is one that seems appropriate.	ity misy iray izay toa mety
He said it looked like a war.	nilaza izy fa toa ady izany
You don’t need more than that.	tsy mila mihoatra noho izany
But that's not my favorite thing to do.	tsy izany anefa no tiako indrindra
Much safer.	tena azo antoka kokoa
So this is all good news.	koa vaovao tsara daholo izany
In the current situation, we cannot do that.	raha ny zavamisy ankehitriny dia tsy afaka manao izany isika
Unlike the others.	tsy toy ny hafa
The car is good.	tsara ilay fiara
Even the non -existent world seems to be dead.	na ny tontolo tsy misy aza toa maty
I came at night.	alina aho no tonga
You are all these things then.	ianao daholo ireo zavatra ireo ary
They were not alone.	tsy nisy irery izy ireo
I love the trip.	tiako ilay dia
He was there for everything and everyone.	teo izy ho anny zavadrehetra sy ny rehetra
One can easily see it.	afaka mahita azy mora foana ny olona iray
It is very important.	tena ilaina izany dia
Make it easy for me.	ataovy mora amiko izany

If you need something, do it.	raha mila zavatra ianao dia ataovy izany
Just do it right.	ataovy tsara fotsiny
Lastly, my favorite.	farany ny tiako indrindra
Stayed away for the night.	nijanona lavitra ny alina
The journey begins.	manomboka ny dia
I had this problem.	nanana io olana io aho
However, you cannot do that.	na izany aza tsy afaka manao toy izany ianao
Others have and you can too.	ny hafa dia manana ary azonao atao koa
Everything was fine, then.	tsara ny zavadrehetra taminizany
This is a big first for both of them.	izany no voalohany lehibe ho azy roa
And it looks good.	ary toa tsara izany
It’s not fast.	tsy haingana izany
But you don’t get the idea.	saingy tsy azonao ilay hevitra
Others may not be so much.	ny hafa angamba tsy dia be loatra
As much as possible.	araka izay azo atao
That is the way here.	izany no lalana eto
All of these things are easy for me.	mora amiko daholo ireo zavatra ireo
He is less visible.	tsy dia hita loatra izy
We hope there will be more to come.	manantena izahay fa mbola hisy ny manaraka
That's exactly what it is.	tena izay tokoa izany
This is also a big problem.	olana lehibe koa izany
You are not an honest person.	tsy olona manao ny marina ianao
Of course, that’s probably the idea.	mazava ho azy fa izany angamba no hevitra
Both are as easy as possible.	samy mora araka izay azo atao
Somehow, it would have always been there.	any ho any dia ho nisy foana izany
He certainly has it.	azo antoka fa manana izany izy
There may be others as well.	mety hisy hafa koa
It’s all so beautiful.	tena tsara tarehy daholo izany
Nothing can go wrong.	tsy misy zavatra mety ho diso
This is another idea for simple work.	ity dia hevitra iray hafa ho anny asa tsotra
Without you, this is not possible.	raha tsy misy anao dia tsy tanteraka izany
Seems confused.	toa very hevitra
The reality, however, is that they don’t know it.	ny zavamisy anefa dia tsy fantany izany
In a place he never had.	tany aminny toerana tsy nisy azy mihitsy
We are next.	isika no manaraka
I get one too.	mahazo iray koa aho
Not by himself.	tsy aminny tenany
Yes, it is and it is not.	eny izany ary tsy izy
It’s two steps.	dingana roa izany
It seemed so small.	toa kely dia kely ilay izy
Maybe one day he will.	angamba indray andro any dia hanao izany izy
There was nothing left.	tsy nisy na inona na inona intsony
The story is about you.	momba anao ny tantara
It all seems so simple.	toa tsotra daholo izany rehetra izany
That’s my favorite part of this.	izany no ampahany tiako indrindra aminity
Then again, no.	avy eo indray aza
This process was only partially meaningful.	ampahany ihany no nisy dikany io dingana io
A little busy here.	be atao kely eto
And it’s closer.	ary akaiky kokoa izany
They still don't know about him.	mbola tsy fantany ny momba azy
It was a bad thing to do.	zavatra ratsy natao izany
He is not alone.	tsy izy irery ihany
Thank you for coming.	misaotra anao tonga
You certainly don’t.	azo antoka fa tsy manao izany ianao
But nothing is clear.	saingy tsy misy zavatra mazava
We were very happy to see the car.	faly be izahay nahita ilay fiara
I like to go fast.	tiako ny mandeha haingana
I have never seen anything like it.	mbola tsy nahita toa azy mihitsy aho
That's a bad word.	teny ratsy be izany
An idea came to him.	nisy hevitra tonga tao aminy
And this other man.	ary ity lehilahy hafa ity
I still find this trip to be a fun time.	mbola hitako fa fotoana mahafinaritra io dia io
Now he does.	ankehitriny dia manao izany izy
Sometimes we go for it.	indraindray isika dia mandeha aminizany
It may not always be clear.	mety tsy mazava foana izany
So he could have come completely to me.	noho izany dia mety ho tonga ho ahy tanteraka izy
The next time has come.	tonga ny fotoana manaraka
We got a little more.	nahazo kely kokoa izahay
It’s too much work.	asa be loatra izany
You told me that once.	nilaza izany tamiko ianao indray mandeha
You can do anything.	afaka manao ny zavadrehetra ianao

It is still night.	mbola alina ny andro
It’s a very simple idea.	hevitra tena tsotra izany

Because it just arrived.	satria vao tonga
They are not alone.	tsy izy ireo ihany
At this point.	aminizao zavamisy izao
There was no time.	tsy nisy tonga fotoana
It’s easy for them.	mora ho azy ireo izany
They will be both, and there will be none.	izy ireo dia ho izy roa ary tsy hisy
But it does make sense.	tena manana hevitra anefa izy io
He is indeed dead.	maty tokoa izy
Such is the new year.	toy izany ny taona vaovao
And he had enough.	ary ampy izy
That is all that can be done.	izay ihany no azo atao
It's still good.	mbola tsara ilay izy
It may not be so.	mety tsy izany no izy
We need to get it right.	mila mahazo tsara izany isika
You can too.	azonao atao koa
Maybe it’s not too much for me.	angamba tsy dia be loatra amiko izany
It can all be done.	azo atao daholo izany
But we need not be too sure.	tsy tokony ho azo antoka loatra anefa isika
This is not stupid.	tsy adala izany
And pictures.	ary sary
we follow him.	manaraka azy isika
Yes, it is not meant to be.	eny tsy natao ho izany
No man has ever seen her.	tsy mbola nisy lehilahy nahita azy
And something else.	ary zavatra hafa koa
But they were too fast.	haingana loatra anefa izy ireo
He looked at the ground.	nijery ny tany izy
You can see them.	afaka mahita azy ireo
Yours is such a place.	ny anao dia toerana toy izany
But there are problems with this approach.	misy olana anefa aminity fomba ity
And maybe not.	ary angamba tsy
She’s not just pretty.	tsy hoe tsara tarehy fotsiny izy
Someone will do it.	misy hanao izany
You just did.	ianao vao nanao
But I love places like that.	tiako anefa ny toerana toy izany
I think you’ll get the part, for sure.	heveriko fa ho azonao ny ampahany azo antoka
But not together, no.	fa tsy miaraka tsia
I saw it from above.	hitako avy any ambony
Even more so.	mbola betsaka kokoa
But they have to hurry.	tsy maintsy haingana anefa izy ireo
This is the least you can do.	ity no kely indrindra azonao atao
It’s hard to see right now.	sarotra ny mahita aminizao fotoana izao
It’s a completely new product.	tena vokatra vaovao tanteraka izy io
This is not a war.	tsy ny ady izany
Of course, this is a personal choice.	mazava ho azy fa safidy manokana izany
I find it a quick and easy option.	hitako ho safidy haingana sy mora izany
I am always close.	akaiky foana aho
They don’t always have enough time for everyone.	tsy manana fotoana ampy ho anny rehetra foana izy ireo
While these stories go.	na dia mandeha ireo tantara ireo
People always need something.	mila zavatra foana ny olona
It was very easy to do.	tena mora ny nanao izany
But they did not know.	tsy fantany anefa ireo
Everything is meaningless.	tsy misy dikany ny zavadrehetra
Unless you already know exactly.	raha tsy efa fantany marina
He really needs everything.	tena mila ny zavadrehetra izy
He will never be free.	tsy ho afaka mihitsy izy
He won't do it, but it's called doing it.	tsy hanao izany izy fa atao hoe manao izany
Although it shouldn’t be.	na dia tsy tokony ho izy aza
But it is not enough to be in it.	tsy ampy anefa ny ho ao anatiny
But they are all men.	lehilahy daholo anefa izy ireo
I can do it, easily.	afaka manao izany aho mora
I love and cherish them both.	tiako sy tiako izy roa
It does a really good thing.	izy io dia manao zavatra tena tsara
I am not a woman.	tsy vehivavy aho
I saw him thinking then.	hitako nieritreritra izy avy eo
Everyone is beautiful to me.	samy tsara tarehy amiko ny rehetra
Didn't have.	tsy nanana
I lost my job.	very asa aho
Not that he wants or needs it.	tsy hoe tiany na mila izany
About it.	momba azy io
But neither is it.	saingy tsy izany koa
Surely that will never happen again.	azo antoka fa tsy hisy intsony izany
There is no room for small products.	tsy misy toerana ho anny vokatra kely
Maybe we haven’t seen it yet.	angamba mbola tsy nahita izany isika
Much better than the previous situation.	tsara lavitra noho ny zavamisy teo aloha
It’s a wonderful place for you.	toerana mahafinaritra anao io
Even this life maybe.	na ity fiainana ity aza angamba
Yes, this is good news.	eny vaovao tsara izany
But they could be better !.	saingy mety ho tsara kokoa izy ireo
This is how this person is.	toy izany ity olona ity
Some of them are really good.	ny sasany aminizy ireo dia tena tsara
I did not come alone.	tsy tonga irery aho
But some are still possible.	mbola azo atao ihany anefa ny sasany
This is my favorite time of the year.	fotoana tiako indrindra aminny taona izao
This world is ours.	antsika ity tontolo ity
Look at this picture.	jereo ity sary ity
I have one like that.	manana iray toy izany aho
In fact, more than that, that’s the reality.	raha ny marina mihoatra noho ny tsy izany izany no zavamisy
It’s still not that bad.	mbola tsy dia ratsy izany
This method is necessary.	ilaina io fomba io
There may be more than one.	mety mihoatra ny iray
Not that it really matters though.	tsy hoe tena zavadehibe na izany aza
It’s not that he’s too loving either.	tsy hoe tia loatra koa izy
He is the story.	izy no tantara
Do the same.	ataovy toy izany koa
Many people still do that.	mbola maro ny olona manao izany
Now we both needed space and time alone.	ankehitriny dia samy nila toerana sy fotoana irery izahay
In general, it makes sense.	aminny ankapobeny dia misy dikany izany
But that is wrong.	fa diso izany
But it will not be so for you.	fa tsy ho toy izany aminao
Which was good for him.	izay tsara taminy
I need to have it.	mila manana izany aho
This is one of the best.	ity no iray aminireo tsara indrindra
Which is all good.	izay tsara daholo
We are all wrong.	diso daholo isika
He had it, and there might be a way.	nanana azy izy ary mety hisy fomba
Especially the bad ones.	indrindra fa ireo ratsy
I didn't tell him.	tsy nilaza taminy aho
You may have others.	mety manana hafa ianao
He couldn't do anything else.	tsy afaka nanao zavatra hafa izy
That's what he thought.	izany no nieritreritra azy
You will come tonight.	ho avy ianao anio alina
And for good reason, he is good.	ary noho ny antony tsara dia tsara izy
Some things became clear.	lasa mazava ny zavatra sasany
I still can't.	mbola tsy afaka aho
And not now, at all times.	ary tsy izao aminny fotoana rehetra
It didn’t seem too hard.	toa tsy dia mafy loatra ilay izy
We hope you enjoyed it.	manantena izahay fa nahafinaritra anao
This is not it.	tsy izy ity
Start small.	manomboka kely
And it is absolutely impossible.	ary tsy azo atao mihitsy
They do it to everyone.	manao izany aminny rehetra izy ireo
He really goes there !.	tena mandeha any izy
This, too, was for no reason.	izany koa dia tsy nisy antony
But there is a first.	misy aloha anefa
Although it may take a long time.	na dia mety ho ela aza izany
You are not stupid like me.	tsy adala toa ahy ianao
I'm busy.	be atao aho
I hope you will do the same.	manantena aho fa hanao toy izany koa ianao
But it’s just beginning.	fa vao manomboka izany
It really meant something to him.	tena nisy dikany taminy izany
It seems like a long time ago.	toa efa ela be izany izao
As he walked, he found a new path.	rehefa nandeha izy dia nahita lalana vaovao
Nothing is going well.	tsy misy mandeha tsara
We are glad to be here.	faly izahay fa tonga eto
Life is different.	hafa ny fiainana
But we are not the same.	tsy mitovy anefa isika
And look at this.	ary jereo ity
At times, they even became confused.	lasa very hevitra be izy ireo indraindray
Thank you to all of us, near and far.	misaotra antsika rehetra na akaiky na lavitra
It doesn’t really matter.	tsy tena zavadehibe izany
He is really great.	lehibe tokoa izy
He will not be found otherwise.	tsy ho hita izy raha tsy izany
He’s everywhere, doing everything.	eny rehetra eny izy manao ny zavadrehetra
They didn’t mean much to me at the time.	tsy nisy dikany tamiko izy ireo taminizany fotoana izany
None of these things seem trivial anymore.	tsy misy na dia iray aza aminireo zavatra ireo no toa tsy misy dikany intsony
Like higher.	toy ny ambony kokoa
But there is no end to it.	tsy misy farany anefa izany
I never did anything.	tsy nanao na inona na inona mihitsy aho
Be honest with him.	ataovy marina aminy
He needs information.	mila vaovao izy
But none of me.	saingy tsy misy amiko
History does not go that way.	tsy mandeha aminizany ny tantara
Or maybe because he knew her well.	na angamba satria fantany tsara izy
He had a good idea about the woman he loved.	nanana hevitra tsara momba ilay vehivavy tiany izy
So that’s what’s important.	ka izay no zavadehibe
There is little to him.	kely ny ho azy any
They were all in a familiar land.	efa tany aminny tany efa mahazatra izy rehetra
Then it started.	dia nanomboka izany
But he can’t, not at all.	saingy tsy afaka izy tsy izany mihitsy
One sees it all the time.	ny iray dia mahita izany aminny fotoana rehetra
The method works that way.	ny fomba dia miasa toy izany
I want to be beautiful.	te ho tsara tarehy
He was somewhere.	tany ho any izy
That's it.	izay no izy
The procedure goes as follows.	ny fomba dia mandeha toy izao manaraka izao
Not fast.	tsy haingana
Or you can come here.	na afaka tonga eto ianao
There is no other option for that.	tsy misy safidy hafa momba izany
Full immediately.	feno avy hatrany
So he was lost.	ka very izy
Some of it, some of it.	ny sasany aminizany ny sasany aminizany
I have to go see him once.	tsy maintsy mandeha mijery azy aho indray mandeha
So, if you know.	noho izany raha fantatrao
I still have the pictures.	mbola manana ny sary aho
But it turned out that there was.	saingy hita fa nisy izany
He will be very good.	ho tena tsara izy
Or they had in the past.	na nanana taminny lasa izy ireo
The story begins.	manomboka ny tantara
If not worse.	raha tsy ratsy kokoa
I hope you do well.	manantena aho fa hanao tsara ianao
Below is the fool.	ity ambany ity ny adala
A lot of people didn’t do that back then.	betsaka ny olona tsy nanao izany taminizany
Or hers, if female.	na ny azy raha vehivavy
And it was almost perfect.	ary saika tanteraka izany
You had to look at the world.	tsy maintsy nijery izao tontolo izao ianao
I look at his face.	mijery ny tarehy aho
He looked at me quickly.	nijery ahy haingana izy
To be a good story.	mba ho tantara tsara
Or something else about it.	na zavatra hafa momba izany
The place was full of people.	feno olona ilay toerana
He who is thankful does it for himself.	izay misaotra dia manao izany ho anny tenany ihany
I came to love them.	lasa tia azy ireo aho
Mine is really beautiful.	ny ahy dia tena tsara tarehy
That’s it, it’s fun.	izany no izy mahafinaritra izany
He just walks.	mandeha fotsiny izy
The world does not do that.	tsy manao izany izao tontolo izao
But I was already thinking about something.	efa nieritreritra zavatra aho anefa
It’s a surefire job.	asa azo antoka izany
Yes, maybe not now.	eny angamba tsy izao
Even women started with him.	na ny vehivavy aza dia nanomboka taminy
This is also very bad.	tena ratsy koa izany
It may be one or the other, but not both.	mety ho iray na hafa izy fa tsy izy roa
Some have said that it does not exist.	misy nilaza fa tsy misy izany
But that is completely wrong.	diso tanteraka anefa izany
A very close war.	ady tena akaiky
Around him, he can’t be anything else.	manodidina azy dia tsy afaka ny ho zavatra hafa izy
In fact, none of them.	raha ny marina tsy misy aminizy ireo
Because he knew something very well.	satria fantany tsara ny zavatra iray
Evil was not in the picture.	tsy teo aminny sary ny ratsy
The method is also completely different.	hafa tanteraka koa ny fomba
It’s just a small job for you.	asa kely fotsiny ho anao izany
Or face.	na tarehy
Just missing and loving you.	tsy hita sy tia anao fotsiny
Not like the general thing.	tsy toy ny zavatra ankapobeny
I’m just as glad they didn’t.	faly toy izany koa aho fa tsy nanao izany izy ireo
I thank them.	misaotra azy ireo aho
It's between you and me.	eo amiko sy ianao izany
Like crazy.	toy ny hoe adala
But this is old news.	vaovao taloha anefa izany
They are very clear.	mazava tsara izy ireo
We don’t do anything.	tsy manao na inona na inona izahay
He didn't look around.	tsy nijery manodidina izy
Just look at me.	jereo fotsiny aho
But that time has not yet come.	tsy mbola tonga anefa izany fotoana izany
I have to go now.	mila mandeha aho izao
This is perfect.	izany dia tanteraka
They seem to work on everything.	toa miasa aminny zavatra rehetra izy ireo
It’s there, too.	eo ihany koa izany
I don't know about you.	tsy fantatro ny momba anao
It seems that it is possible.	toy ny hoe azo atao mihitsy izany
You need to do things right.	mila manao zavatra araka ny tokony ho izy
There is no game without work.	tsy misy lalao raha tsy misy asa
And not too early.	ary tsy aloha loatra
It’s so far away.	tena lavitra tokoa izany
It’s close, though.	akaiky izany na izany aza
He doesn't need me anymore.	tsy mila ahy intsony izy
They don’t do that much.	tsy dia manao izany loatra izy ireo
So you are not alone.	noho izany dia tsy irery ianao
Good idea, but no.	hevitra tsara fa tsia
I hope not, but if it is, it is true.	manantena aho fa tsy izany fa raha izany no izy dia marina izany
We won't be here long.	tsy ela izahay no eto
It couldn’t be that simple.	tsy mety ho tsotra toy izany
Hard and immediate.	mafy ary avy hatrany
Because it was too difficult.	satria sarotra loatra ilay izy
The problem is not everything is the same.	ny olana dia tsy mitovy ny zavadrehetra
He’s so insignificant.	tena tsy misy dikany izy
For one, because it will be too long.	ho anny iray satria ho ela loatra izany
It doesn’t make sense now, though.	tsy misy dikany izany ankehitriny na izany aza
I love it too, and it’s really good.	tiako koa ilay izy ary tena tsara
Even worse, he is not alone.	mbola ratsy kokoa aza fa tsy irery izy
And that’s what great work is all about.	ary izany no atao hoe asa lehibe
He didn't even know.	tsy fantany akory izy
Anyway, now someone has.	na izany na tsy izany izao misy olona manana
It can’t be the same woman.	tsy mety ho ilay vehivavy ihany
The reality, of course, is very different.	ny zavamisy mazava ho azy dia hafa be
We have to make choices.	tsy maintsy manao safidy isika
So it was too close to me.	noho izany dia akaiky loatra ahy izy io
It may not be good at first, but it works.	mety tsy ho tsara izany aminny voalohany fa miasa
But we are the same.	fa mitovy isika
They love being with him.	tia miaraka aminy izy ireo
I need a place here.	mila toerana eto aho
This work is new.	vaovao ity asa ity
We do things out of nothing here.	manao zavatra avy aminny tsy misy eto izahay
Thanks to me they are all gone.	misaotra ahy fa lasa izy rehetra
No, it's true about him.	tsia marina ny momba azy
The other is an idea.	ny iray hafa dia hevitra
Now look where they were.	jereo izao ny toerana nisy azy ireo
So we have a little time.	noho izany dia manana fotoana kely isika
People can go and walk as they please.	afaka mandeha sy mandeha araka izay tiany ny olona
Then it came as it should.	dia tonga araka ny tokony ho izy
But, that’s all for now.	saingy izany rehetra izany dia izao
But now we have a problem with time.	saingy manana olana aminny fotoana isika izao
Then I, of course.	avy eo aho mazava ho azy
There is no place to come.	tsy misy toerana ho tonga
We are there and they are there.	eo isika ary misy izy ireo
They may not be clear.	mety tsy mazava izy ireo
But it really does exist.	saingy tena misy tokoa izany
I wouldn’t have known otherwise.	tsy ho fantatro raha tsy izany
So that’s a good idea.	ka hevitra tsara izany
They are the best.	izy ireo no tsara indrindra
It’s simple here.	tsotra izany ny eto
But there is more.	mbola misy zavatra hafa koa anefa
He is a man.	lehilahy iray izy
If it even works.	raha miasa mihitsy aza
Make sure.	ataovy azo antoka
Now, that may seem familiar.	ankehitriny mety toa mahazatra izany
One of them.	iray aminizany
No one has seen it yet.	mbola tsy nisy nahita izany
Now he is there too.	ankehitriny dia efa tonga any koa izy
Then he will be happy.	dia ho faly izy
And, yes, a lot goes for it.	ary eny be dia be ny mandeha ho azy
In fact, they are not just words.	raha ny tena izy dia tsy teny fotsiny izy ireo
It's ours.	anay izany
He’s just a fool.	izy ihany no adala
It has a lot of pictures.	manana sary maro izy io
One and the same.	iray ary mitovy
But it is absolutely true.	saingy marina tanteraka izany
But it’s not going well.	saingy tsy mandeha araka ny tokony ho izy
Whatever it is, it’s not a big story.	na inona na inona izany dia tsy tantara lehibe izany
Surely this man could have done better than that.	azo antoka fa afaka manao tsara kokoa noho izany ity lehilahy ity
I could have done that, of course.	afaka nanao izany aho mazava ho azy
I am from him now.	avy aminy aho izao
The hardest part is working alone.	ny sarotra indrindra dia ny miasa irery
Although they are from two completely different worlds.	na dia avy aminny tontolo roa samy hafa tanteraka aza izy ireo
If something is wrong, it may not be.	raha misy zavatra tsy mety dia mety tsy izany
Often, we do things because no one else is going to do it.	matetika manao zavatra isika satria tsy misy olona hanao izany
You are just a little man.	lehilahy kely fotsiny ianao
It will be money.	ho vola izany
So he knew.	ka fantany
But in fact, it is not so simple.	saingy raha ny marina dia tsy dia tsotra izany
He is indeed dead.	efa maty tokoa
Make her beautiful.	ataovy tsara tarehy izy
But that’s not the point.	saingy tsy izany no zavadehibe
And for him.	ary ho azy
In fact, you don’t need it.	raha ny marina tsy mila izany
And the world goes without us.	ary mandeha tsy misy antsika izao tontolo izao
She began to love him more.	nanomboka tia azy bebe kokoa izy
Lost to everyone.	very aminny tsirairay
This is not a bad thing, in fact.	tsy asa ratsy izany raha ny marina
Good thing we got you.	tsara fa nahazo anao izahay
However, this is certainly not the case.	na izany aza azo antoka fa tsy izany no izy
It really got to me.	tena nahazo ahy izany
Not as good as me.	tsy tsara toy ny ahy
He looked away from me, hard.	nijery lavitra ahy izy mafy
Absolutely not.	tena tsy izany mihitsy
There are sometimes.	misy indraindray
You should know things like that.	tokony ho fantatrao ny zavatra toy izany
There were nice pictures.	nisy sary mahafinaritra
I think it was a fun story.	heveriko fa tantara mahafinaritra ilay izy
I don’t know much.	tsy dia fantatro loatra
Yes, it could be just me.	eny mety ho ahy ihany izany
But they may have done so.	mety ho nanao izany anefa izy ireo
I haven’t said anything about them yet.	tsy mbola nilaza na inona na inona momba azy ireo aho
It’s a small thing.	ny zavatra kely izany
And he will continue to do so.	ary mbola hanao izany foana izy
It is also an option.	safidy ihany koa io
I will do better.	hanao tsara kokoa aho
He looked at her very closely.	nijery azy akaiky dia akaiky izy
I just did it, but nothing more.	nanao izany fotsiny aho fa tsy mihoatra
Not so, but something like that.	tsy izany no izy fa zavatra toy izany
No one went far.	tsy nisy nandeha lavitra
But that may not always be a good thing.	mety tsy ho zavatra tsara foana anefa izany
He may have had a favorite place.	mety nanana toerana tiany indrindra izy
So, we have to be a game.	noho izany tokony ho lalao isika
I haven't seen anyone yet.	tsy mbola nahita olona
He could not do what he was supposed to do.	tsy afaka nanao izay tokony ho azy izy
Of course, the two are different.	mazava ho azy fa samy hafa ny roa
Maybe that’s the only way.	angamba io ihany no lalana
Really not immediately.	tena tsy eo no ho eo
Check them out if you haven’t already.	jereo izy ireo raha mbola tsy nanao izany ianao
You are a free person.	olona afaka ianao
Which is true.	izay marina
Not all of them.	tsy izy rehetra ihany
I look, yes, different.	mijery aho eny hafa
Yes, even here.	eny na dia eto aza
He loved himself.	tiany ho azy ny tenany
All options.	ny safidy rehetra
And, we all do.	ary manao izany isika rehetra
It’s all for women.	ho anny vehivavy daholo
it is night and day.	alina sy andro izany
He really had a life.	tena nanana fiainana izy
He won’t do the drawing.	tsy hanao ny sary izy
I think he knows that too.	heveriko fa fantany koa izany
So there are a lot of possibilities.	noho izany dia maro ny mety
But it could have happened.	mety ho nisy anefa izany
But it turns out it’s not easy.	saingy hita fa tsy mora izany
It wasn't very fun.	tsy dia nahafinaritra loatra ny azy
Not from the game, and not tonight either.	tsy avy aminny lalao ary tsy anio alina koa
Too much news.	be loatra ny vaovao
They are all good, yes.	tsara izy rehetra eny
Do it for him.	ataovy ho azy izany
He saw a lot of cars.	nahita fiara be dia be izy
They do it all.	manao izany rehetra izany izy ireo
It's just two.	roa ihany izany
The world is.	izao tontolo izao dia
Or did nothing.	na nanao na inona na inona
Therefore, other methods are needed for the work.	noho izany dia ilaina ny fomba hafa ho anny asa
You will definitely get there, and you will be beautiful.	ho tonga any tokoa ianao ary ho tsara tarehy
Women to others.	vehivavy aminny hafa
You still look bad.	mbola mijery ratsy ianao
You are for me.	ianao no ho ahy
I still need something.	mbola mila zavatra aho
You do this part for yourself.	ianao no manao ity ampahany ity ho anao
It doesn’t follow.	tsy manaraka izany
I’m really crazy about him.	tena adala mihitsy aho momba azy
Especially when it doesn’t work.	indrindra fa tsy miasa
Only people there.	olona any ihany
And he might as well be free, if he wanted to.	ary mety ho afaka koa izy raha tiany
And he always looks good when he does.	ary mijery tsara foana izy rehefa manao izany
We need a little.	mila kely izahay
Two years ago there was one.	roa taona lasa izay no nisy iray
But, it’s still a relatively new idea.	saingy mbola hevitra somary vaovao ihany
I don't deserve it.	tsy mendrika ahy
Just look at me here.	jereo fotsiny eto aho
It was very beautiful there.	tena tsara tarehy tany
He already knew that, too.	efa fantany koa izany
Yes, it comes down to it.	eny tonga aminizany
But you have to be here.	saingy tsy maintsy eto ianao
He seemed to think.	toa nieritreritra izy
He started the same as before.	nanomboka toy ny teo aloha ihany izy
Often this is not a good thing.	matetika dia tsy zavatra tsara izany
But in a different way it was completely different.	saingy taminny fomba hafa dia hafa mihitsy izany
He stopped one day.	nijanona izy indray andro
I'm close now.	akaiky aho izao
But not for me.	tsy raha ny amiko anefa
It is still the same today.	mbola izany ihany ankehitriny
Not that kind of story.	tsy izany karazana tantara izany
I got money.	nahazo vola aho
The food here is not good.	tsy tsara ny sakafo eto
Just looking at you.	mijery anao fotsiny
Almost a man.	saika lehilahy iray
But that is the story now.	izany anefa no tantara ankehitriny
If bad.	raha ny ratsy
There is nothing wrong with that.	tsy misy ratsy atao
Or they might do it.	na mety hanao izany izy ireo
Lots of people.	olona maro be
They immediately do it.	avy hatrany dia manao izany izy ireo
All somewhere.	rehetra any ho any
Everyone can have a bad time.	mety hisy fotoana ratsy ny rehetra
I think there was.	heveriko fa nisy
Everything was possible with it.	ny zavatra rehetra dia azo natao taminizany
The idea is correct.	marina ny hevitra
It works for me.	miasa ho ahy
They are no better.	tsy tsara kokoa izy ireo
Easy, and simple.	mora ary tsotra
You are in the right place.	eo aminny toerana mety ianao
There was no reason for them either.	tsy nisy antony koa tokony ho izy ireo
And no games.	ary tsy misy lalao
I thank you for him.	misaotra anao aho noho ny aminy
One last job.	asa iray farany
And of course he did.	ary mazava ho azy fa nanao izany izy
That is not real life.	tsy izany no tena fiainana
He had to tell her.	tsy maintsy nilaza taminy izy
I think we are very different.	heveriko fa samy hafa loatra isika
The information is simply not enough.	tsy ampy fotsiny ny vaovao
All three had different questions.	samy nanana fanontaniana samy hafa izy telo ireo
They will not be happy.	tsy ho faly izy ireo
It's his, not mine.	azy io fa tsy ahy
More than one.	mihoatra ny iray aminizany
I also enjoyed the first one.	nahafinaritra ahy koa ilay voalohany

Thanks so much for all the good ideas.	misaotra betsaka aminny hevitra tsara rehetra
Yes, they did see him.	eny nahita azy tokoa izy ireo
At the time, there were three of them.	taminizany fotoana izany dia telo izy ireo
That is all that is needed.	izay ihany no ilaina
It suits me better.	mety kokoa amiko ilay izy
He had once before.	nanana indray mandeha izy taloha
Generally low.	aminny ankapobeny ambany
It can be one of two ways.	mety ho iray aminireo fomba roa izany
However, it was an exciting year.	na izany aza taona nahafinaritra izany
It will be one of the two.	ho iray aminizy roa izany
We can do difficult things.	afaka manao zavatra sarotra isika
Not in a bad way.	tsy aminny fomba ratsy
He does not have to walk alone.	tsy mila mandeha irery izy
This is not enough for the overall picture.	tsy ampy ho anny sary ankapobeny izany
It’s not, of course.	tsy izy io mazava ho azy
I want to be beautiful.	te ho tsara tarehy aho
I don’t want to do too much of it.	tsy te hanao be loatra anio aho
He seems to have many others as well.	toa manana maro hafa koa izy
However, you don’t come.	na izany aza tsy tonga ianao
This is due to an inadequate process.	izany dia noho ny dingana tsy ampy
It will not be without them.	tsy ho tsy misy azy ireo
He didn't see me right away.	tsy nahita ahy avy hatrany izy
Sometimes that can be a good thing.	indraindray dia mety ho zavatra tsara izany
We don’t anymore.	tsy manao intsony izahay
He always loved her.	tiany foana izy
And there are many reasons.	ary maro ny antony
It has never been the same.	tsy mbola nisy koa izany
For better or for worse.	na ho tsara na ho ratsy
And look at everything perfectly.	ary jereo tanteraka ny zavadrehetra

This is a more difficult problem.	olana sarotra kokoa izany
But this is not fun.	tsy mahafinaritra anefa izany
He didn't think of anything like that.	tsy nieritreritra zavatra toy izany izy
We still don’t do that while working.	tsy mbola manao izany izahay raha miasa
Arrived at.	tonga tany aminny
Or so they used to be.	na toy izany koa izy ireo taloha
Maybe it could be that simple.	angamba mety ho tsotra izany
So you lose nothing.	ka tsy misy very na inona na inona ianao
I didn’t go very far.	tsy dia lasa lavitra loatra aho
I also have a little picture.	manana sary kely ihany koa aho
However, some hope it will be more difficult.	na izany aza misy manantena fa ho sarotra kokoa izany

But we never do that.	saingy tsy manao izany mihitsy izahay
These are the first paths.	ireo no lalana voalohany
Yes, not as it should be.	eny tsy araka ny tokony ho izy

A lot of people didn’t.	betsaka ny olona tsy nanao izany
He finally went.	nandeha ihany izy
So they are tough.	ka mafy izy ireo
I already had them.	efa nanana azy ireo aho
There will be options for that.	hisy safidy aminizany
Not tonight.	tsy ity alina ity
And it’s like they need one.	ary toy ny hoe mila iray izy ireo
If you still have it, here’s why.	raha mbola manana izany ianao dia izao no antony
He really deserves it.	tena mendrika izany izy
Sometimes you won’t.	indraindray ianao tsy hanao izany
They have always been meant to be that way.	natao ho toy izany foana izy ireo
In the end, they get it right.	aminny farany dia mahazo tsara azy ireo izy ireo
They are the real action.	izy ireo no tena hetsika
He never liked this place.	tsy tiany mihitsy ity toerana ity
Now people needed someone with an idea.	ankehitriny dia nila olona manana hevitra ny olona
The man is wonderful.	mahafinaritra ilay lehilahy
That's how it is.	toy izany no izy
Work is very important.	tena zavadehibe tokoa ny asa
Those two always.	ireo roa ireo foana
You want to do it right away.	te hanao izany avy hatrany ianao
We do the same today.	manao toy izany koa isika izao
This is part of his favorite story.	ity no ampahany taminny tantara tiany
Right now, it’s dead, really dead.	aminizao fotoana izao dia maty tena maty
He has already gotten there.	efa tonga tany ho any izy
I'm just crazy.	adala fotsiny aho
But it’s better.	saingy tsara kokoa izany
Sometimes it’s both, sometimes it’s not.	indraindray dia izy roa indraindray tsy
This is a common problem.	olana mahazatra izany
It seems to be going well.	toa mandeha tsara izy io

It was a difficult time for me.	fotoana sarotra tamiko izany
We don’t come to this issue.	tsy tonga eto aminity olana ity izahay
We haven’t started that yet.	mbola tsy nanomboka izany isika
And there it is.	ary eo izany
But in fact, it doesn’t work for me.	saingy raha ny marina dia tsy mandeha izany raha ny amiko
It’s a simple job.	asa tsotra izany
Don't need it.	aza mila izany
People can't do anything.	tsy afaka manao na inona na inona ny olona
He is the man.	izy ilay lehilahy
That guy is right.	mety io lehilahy io
You are a bad thing.	ianao zavatra ratsy
Someone has to come to him.	tsy maintsy misy olona tonga any aminy
And there were those who did not want to come.	ary nisy koa ireo tsy te ho tonga
Some of them, you may already know.	ny sasany aminizy ireo mety efa fantatrao
Yes, more on that to come.	eny bebe kokoa momba izany ho avy
That is true, in fact.	marina izany raha ny marina
That’s, you know, the problem.	izany fantatrao ny olana
When we went and you knew you were going.	rehefa nandeha izahay ary fantatrao fa mandeha ianao

He likes to be busy, he said.	tia be atao izy hoy izy
This was fun !.	nahafinaritra ity
So we have to do it personally.	noho izany dia tsy maintsy manao izany manokana isika
In fact, I don’t know much about him.	raha ny tena izy dia tsy dia fantatro loatra ny momba azy
I thought of many things.	nieritreritra zavatra maro aho
He looked her up and down.	nijery azy ambony sy ambany izy
And it’s a good job.	ary asa tsara izany
Just a game.	lalao fotsiny
In general, this is not appropriate.	aminny ankapobeny dia tsy mety izany
The most important thing.	ny tena zavadehibe
You can find things there.	afaka mahita zavatra any ianao
He quickly looks around.	mijery haingana ny manodidina izy

It's yours.	anao io
I went there.	nandeha tany aho
As for the reason, of course.	raha ny momba ny antony mazava ho azy
It may be like that, but no more.	mety ho toa azy fa tsy mihoatra
I'm not doing you any harm.	tsy manao ratsy aminao aho
And they are just like us.	ary toa antsika ihany izy ireo
He needs ideas.	mila hevitra izy
We are upstairs.	any ambony izahay
Not all yet.	tsy mbola rehetra
Whether you know it or not.	na fantatrao izany na tsy fantatrao
But these are very true.	tena marina anefa ireo
It is very important to go.	tena ilaina ny mandeha
Or you might do it.	na mety hanao izany ianao
You need the full story.	mila ny tantara feno ianao
Maybe we will.	angamba isika hanao izany
It’s not about age.	tsy momba ny taona izany
They are mine.	ahy izy ireo
If so, there is nothing you can do now.	raha eny tsy misy azonao atao izao
This part is very important.	tena zavadehibe tokoa io ampahany io
However, it is necessary to have.	na izany aza dia ilaina ny manana
There really is no other way.	tena tsy misy fomba hafa mihitsy
I found in No.	hitako tao aminny no
But that is not the case.	tsy izay anefa no antony
This work is very important.	tena zavadehibe tokoa io asa io
Or maybe not enough.	na angamba tsy ampy
Now it had a safe house.	ankehitriny dia nanana trano azo antoka izy io
But we didn’t and we couldn’t.	saingy tsy nanao izany izahay ary tsy afaka
The world is theirs.	azy ireo izao tontolo izao
They have life again.	manana fiainana indray izy ireo
I will never do that.	tsy hanao izany mihitsy
We ended up having nothing.	tsy nanana na inona na inona izahay taminny farany
If you don’t go now, they will come.	raha tsy mandeha izao ianao dia ho avy izy ireo
In fact, they could have been worse.	raha ny marina dia mety ho ratsy kokoa izy ireo
There was a game.	nisy lalao
What does not exist, cannot and never will.	izay tsy misy tsy azo atao ary tsy hisy mihitsy
Going very fast.	mandeha haingana dia haingana
He didn't look at anything in particular.	tsy nijery na inona na inona manokana izy
This is the time of year.	izany no fotoana aminny taona
Part of me is not.	ny ampahany amiko dia tsy
This is the wrong way.	diso lalana io
I like the question.	tiako ilay fanontaniana
There is a lot you need to know.	betsaka ny zavatra tokony ho fantatrao
However, you can’t.	na izany aza tsy afaka ianao
It almost always works.	saika miasa foana izy io
It makes sense, he thought.	misy dikany izany hoy izy nieritreritra
The place was full of people.	feno olona ny toerana
The war had just begun.	vao nanomboka ny ady
Or it could be something completely different.	na mety ho zavatra hafa tanteraka izany
This is not small but big.	tsy kely ity fa lehibe
We deserve better than that.	mendrika tsara noho izany isika
Some of them do work.	ny sasany aminizy ireo dia manao asa
Don't do it anymore.	aza manao intsony izao
There is no money in it.	tsy misy vola ao aminy
Everything came in a nice and orderly way.	tonga taminny fomba tsara sy tsara ny zavadrehetra
Lots of activity here.	betsaka ny hetsika eto
Right now we have to be very special.	aminizao fotoana izao dia tokony ho tena manokana isika
Still more than that.	mbola mihoatra noho izany ihany
Some don’t like it.	tsy tia ny sasany
Or, I really didn’t see it.	na tena tsy nahita izany
It’s always a war.	ady foana io
You can get it now.	afaka mahazo izany ianao izao
But he did not see many people.	tsy nahita olona maro anefa izy
Just being there.	ny hoe eo fotsiny
It will be better.	ho tsara kokoa
He is now in another world.	tany aminny tontolo hafa izy izao
Overall, the food is very good.	aminny ankapobeny ny sakafo dia tena tsara
But there was also work.	nisy asa koa anefa
Of course, that kind of thing wasn’t done.	mazava ho azy fa tsy natao izany karazana izany
He knew it was his.	fantany fa azy io
But at first.	saingy taminny voalohany
People who really have jobs that really make money.	olona tena manana asa tena mahazo vola
So, the question.	noho izany ny fanontaniana
Far, far to the future.	lavitra lavitra ny ho avy
Everything is easy to navigate.	mora mandeha daholo
I am just one of many.	iray aminireo maro ihany aho
So please.	na koa
They are more than anything.	mihoatra noho ny zavadrehetra izy ireo
You can do it here.	azonao atao izany eto
Yes, even internally.	eny na dia ao anatiny aza
Very good, he said.	tena tsara hoy izy
And it doesn’t work anymore.	ary tsy mety intsony izany
We are not too small.	tsy dia kely loatra isika
These are just fun stories.	tantara mahafinaritra fotsiny ireo
It needs to be fast.	mila haingana izany
The first is always the best.	ny voalohany no tsara indrindra foana
You have to get it.	tsy maintsy mahazo izany ianao
But it always did and still does.	saingy nanao izany foana ary mbola manao izany
Yes, it's fast.	eny haingana izany
I hope we all do.	manantena antsika rehetra aho
But the reason is simple.	fa ny antony dia tsotra
Well, a lot of that.	eny ary betsaka aminizany
It’s not worth it, but it’s not too bad.	tsy mendrika izany saingy tsy dia ratsy loatra
I have to be a man.	tsy maintsy lehilahy aho
That is true, and it is not again.	marina izany ary tsy izany indray
Life is a problem.	ny fiainana dia olana
Not much time.	tsy dia be ny fotoana
Otherwise, everything seems fine.	raha tsy izany dia toa tsara daholo ny zavadrehetra
What was done was very bad.	tena ratsy ny natao
But it started a long time ago.	nanomboka ela be anefa izany
Yes, these were wonderful times.	eny fotoana nahafinaritra ireo
He didn't even know he was there.	tsy fantany akory hoe teo izy
But that's not it at all.	saingy tsy izy mihitsy izany
He got them too.	nahazo azy ireo koa izy
Everyone can do things easily.	afaka manao zavatra mora daholo ny rehetra
They are close to home.	akaiky ny trano izy ireo
Usually one or two are gone, not all three.	matetika ny iray na roa no lasa fa tsy izy telo
More often than not it works.	matetika kokoa noho ny tsy miasa
They may not have known they existed.	mety tsy fantany fa nisy izy ireo
I certainly don’t have that.	azo antoka fa tsy manana izany aho
You just have to be there.	mila ho eo fotsiny ianao
But not here.	tsy eto anefa
There are two reasons, they said.	roa ny antony hoy izy ireo
The more trivial things.	ny zavatra tsy misy dikany kokoa
It’s not easy, but yes, it’s necessary.	tsy mora izany fa eny ilaina izany
He didn't seem to see her.	toa tsy nahita azy izy
Indeed, there is no such thing.	eny tokoa tsy misy toy izany
And the idea that.	ary ny hevitra hoe
But no, it was there.	saingy tsia teo izy io
He just doesn’t like it.	tsy tiany fotsiny
I finally saw him.	hitako izy taminny farany
We are the future and not the past.	isika no ho avy fa tsy ny lasa
You are not working.	tsy miasa ianao
And certainly not from you.	ary azo antoka fa tsy avy aminao
Something bigger and better is to come.	zavatra lehibe sy tsara kokoa ho avy
There is no future.	tsy misy intsony ny ho avy
And they really do make it a reality.	ary tena manao zavamisy izy ireo
Because it's not about him at all.	satria tsy momba azy mihitsy ilay izy
But this is not a new part of the process.	saingy tsy ampahany vaovao aminny dingana izany
I did not come to you.	tsy tonga tany aminao aho
Three had no questions.	telo no tsy nisy fanontaniana
It is also far away.	lavitra koa izy io
He wanted it all for himself, but only for himself.	tiany ho azy daholo izany fa ny azy ihany
However, it is more worth it.	na izany aza mendrika kokoa izany
For no other reason.	tsy misy antony hafa izany
You just don’t like them.	tsy tianao fotsiny izy ireo
Nothing is true anymore.	tsy misy marina intsony
Seems untrue.	toy ny tsy marina
New style, tonight.	fomba vaovao anio alina
This part is difficult.	sarotra io ampahany io
No one ever saw it.	tsy nisy nahita izany mihitsy
Real work, he told himself.	asa marina hoy izy taminny tenany
This land.	ity tany ity
This conversation can be good or bad.	io resaka io dia mety ho tsara na ratsy
But that woman is not allowed.	tsy azo atao anefa izany vehivavy izany
But it is now dead.	saingy efa maty izany ankehitriny
It was an old war.	ady taloha izany
There were two or three others.	nisy roa na telo hafa
To me, it’s already a process.	amiko dia efa dingana izany
I love it so much.	tiako loatra ilay izy
The reason is uncertain.	tsy azo antoka ny antony
It just didn’t work.	tsy nandeha fotsiny izany
Three days ago.	telo andro lasa izay
But history is far from over.	mbola lavitra anefa ny tantara
You now have many options.	manana safidy maro ianao izao
I have never seen anything like it.	tsy mbola nahita aho fa ny toa azy
And yet, all faces remained there.	ary na izany aza ny tarehy rehetra dia nijanona teo
But you should have seen me.	tokony ho nahita ahy anefa ianao
But again, this is wrong.	diso indray anefa izany
But he only loves himself.	fa ny tenany ihany no tiany
It is impossible not to be.	tsy azo atao ny tsy ho izy
There is nothing right or wrong with the game.	tsy misy tsara na diso aminny lalao
But, therefore, he is like that.	saingy noho izany dia toy izany izy
It should be the other way around.	tokony ho ny fomba hafa izany
Lots of men to come.	betsaka ny lehilahy ho avy
He didn’t get too close.	tsy lasa akaiky loatra izy
He was still too young for her.	mbola kely loatra taminy izy
Not much of a thing.	tsy zavatra betsaka
So, simply, he went.	noho izany tsotra izy no nandeha
Because of me.	noho ny amiko
Question, perhaps.	fanontaniana angamba
But it doesn’t do anything like that.	saingy tsy manao na inona na inona toy izany
It used to be in many other lands.	tany maro hafa izy io taloha
This is not a new story.	tsy tantara vaovao izany
We travel a long way.	mandeha dia lavitra izahay
He would not have had it.	tsy ho nanana izany izy
All around.	ny manodidina rehetra
It’s like he’s going to do it.	toy ny hoe hanao izany izy
Everything is new.	vaovao ny zavadrehetra
Some are bigger than others.	ny sasany lehibe kokoa noho ny hafa
There is nothing difficult about money.	tsy misy zavatra sarotra aminny vola
Even if it’s not, it’s going faster.	na dia tsy izany aza dia haingana kokoa ny mandeha
It will be very simple.	ho tsotra be izany
This is for men.	ity dia natao ho anny lehilahy
So, we can do it.	noho izany afaka manao izany isika
He said good things about me.	nilaza zavatra tsara momba ahy izy
Some were even people close to him.	ny sasany aza dia olona akaiky azy
Now, of course, they all had faces for me.	ankehitriny mazava ho azy samy nanana tarehy tamiko izy rehetra
People are watching.	mijery ny olona
It’s really hard at times.	tena sarotra indraindray
But no one is up there.	saingy tsy misy olona any ambony
For a big reason.	noho ny antony lehibe iray
And he never knew it.	ary tsy fantany mihitsy izany
Thanks to all of us for coming here.	misaotra antsika rehetra tonga eto
He wanted me to do it.	tiany hanao izany aho
Like you need more time with me.	toy ny hoe mila fotoana bebe kokoa miaraka amiko
Otherwise, not too much.	raha tsy izany dia tsy dia be loatra
Now, there is the real problem here.	ankehitriny misy ny tena olana eto
I began to see why.	nanomboka nahita ny antony aho
Something needed to be done.	zavatra nila natao
If this is the case, there is no time at all.	raha toa ka ity dia tsy misy fotoana mihitsy
We won't even be there.	tsy ho any akory izahay
Money is the problem.	ny vola no olana
And yes, it’s really fun.	ary eny tena mahafinaritra izany
You said.	hoy ianao hoe
If you have it, you probably know it.	raha manana azy ianao dia azo antoka fa fantatrao izany
Sometimes it goes the other way.	indraindray dia mandeha aminny fomba hafa izany
In fact, you already have it.	raha ny marina dia efa manana izany ianao
He saw someone.	nahita olona izy
Start when you want.	manomboka aminny fotoana tianao
But there is something else at work.	saingy misy zavatra hafa aminny asa
And farther.	ary lavitra kokoa
Kind of unusual.	karazana tsy mahazatra
But even that is really out of place.	saingy na dia tena tsy misy toerana aza
He needs both.	mila azy roa izy
And that’s exactly the idea.	ary izay indrindra no hevitra
Happy to do so.	faly manao izany
But bigger.	saingy lehibe kokoa
He just can’t do it.	tsy afaka manao izany fotsiny izy
Not unless he told her.	tsy raha tsy nilaza taminy izy
But people are different when they are there.	hafa ihany anefa ny olona rehefa eo aminy
Now this is common.	ankehitriny dia mahazatra izany
Everywhere.	eny rehetra eny
These things.	ireo zavatra ireo
They should never be easy.	tsy tokony ho mora mihitsy izy ireo
He didn't even know where they were.	tsy fantany akory izay nisy azy ireo
He couldn't have it.	tsy afaka nanana izany izy
That is this place.	izany hoe ity toerana ity
But that is not really the case.	tsy tena toy izany anefa ilay izy
Just like back then.	toy ny taminizany fotoana izany ihany
Very easy.	tena mora
This man is handsome.	tsara tarehy ity lehilahy ity
Everything is one.	iray ny zavatra rehetra
He also watched.	izy koa dia nijery
It was as if it had already existed.	toy ny efa nisy ihany ilay izy
It all came true.	tanteraka daholo izany
It’s not just one thing, but many things.	tsy zavatra iray ihany izany fa zavatra maro
We have to look to the future.	tsy maintsy mijery ny ho avy
I think a lot.	heveriko fa betsaka
I am very real.	tena zavamisy aho
Last but not least.	farany dia tsy ny kely indrindra
It’s really fun and exciting.	tena mahafinaritra sy mahafinaritra tokoa izany
Yes, and then some.	eny ary avy eo ny sasany
But one day something will go wrong.	saingy indray andro any dia hisy zavatra tsy mety
He is the only free man.	izy irery no olona afaka
Better than nothing.	tsara kokoa noho ny tsy nisy izany
But it was good.	tsara anefa ilay izy
The two are very different.	tena tsy mitovy ny roa
This process is done when absolutely necessary.	ity dingana ity dia atao rehefa tena ilaina tokoa
You are too good at.	tsara loatra ianao aminny
It can be done completely.	afaka tanteraka izany
So someone saw it.	ka nisy nahita izany
Someone loves us.	misy olona tia antsika
However, these are easily misunderstood.	na izany aza mora diso hevitra ireo
Yes, nothing.	eny tsy misy na inona na inona
I had a lot of fun.	nahafinaritra be aho
It could all have happened.	mety ho nisy izany rehetra izany
He died walking.	maty nandeha izy
The question is very simple.	tena tsotra ny fanontaniana
This is because of you.	izany dia noho ianao
It has no future.	tsy misy ho avy izany
They will be tough.	ho mafy izy ireo
You are always happy.	faly foana ianao
Different to me, though.	hafa amiko na izany aza
There are also good options.	misy ihany koa ny safidy tsara
And you will be happy.	ary ho faly ianao
Because words are hard.	satria sarotra ny teny
The world is no longer going that way.	tsy mandeha toy izany intsony izao tontolo izao
We had no other access.	tsy nahazo lalana hafa izahay
He knew he wasn't wrong.	fantany fa tsy diso izy taminizany
This event goes on at first.	ity hetsika ity dia mandeha aminny voalohany
We are so glad we don’t have a car.	tena faly izahay tsy manana fiara
They both have a great time.	samy manana fotoana mahafinaritra izy ireo
Of course, there must be a reason.	mazava ho azy fa tsy maintsy misy antony
In the end, it’s really not about you.	aminny farany dia tena tsy momba anao izany
She’s a pretty little thing.	zavatra kely tsara tarehy izy
And when they do, there can be problems.	ary rehefa manao izany izy ireo dia mety hisy olana
You are wrong.	ianao no diso
He had no choice.	tsy nanana safidy izy
First of all, this is not the case.	voalohany indrindra tsy izany no atao
It's just hard.	mafy tsotra izao
And he is a man.	ary lehilahy izy
But there was a problem.	nisy olana iray anefa
For now, it should be like a normal process.	aminizao fotoana izao dia tokony ho toy ny dingana mahazatra izany
However, we are still far from them.	na izany aza mbola lavitra azy ireo isika
See what’s important.	jereo ny zavadehibe
Because they really need it.	satria tena mila izany izy ireo
But, and that’s important.	saingy ary zavadehibe izany

You just make good food.	manao sakafo tsara fotsiny ianao
Tonight is night.	anio alina no alina
There was no action.	tsy nisy hetsika
I don’t have that option.	tsy manana izany safidy izany aho
I like the food.	tiako ny sakafo
But that is still not the case.	saingy mbola tsy izany no zavamisy
It was enough to see him there.	ampy izay ny nahita azy teo
I have to know if you are a good person.	tsy maintsy fantatro raha olona tsara ianao
But we could have done more.	afaka nanao bebe kokoa anefa izahay
It’s hard to start.	sarotra ny manomboka izany
And most importantly, he was happy.	ary ny tena zavadehibe dia faly izy
But it’s starting all over again.	saingy manomboka indray izany
This is for a good reason.	izany dia noho ny antony marina
But at the same time it is beautiful.	saingy aminny fotoana iray dia tsara tarehy
That’s what’s important here.	izay no zavadehibe eto
The man did not look down.	tsy nijery ambany ilay lehilahy
But no one said that you had to die.	tsy nisy nilaza anefa hoe tsy maintsy maty ianao
You need me.	mila ahy ianao
He started walking faster.	nanomboka nandeha haingana kokoa izy
And they do it faster.	ary manao izany haingana kokoa izy ireo
We can be with everyone.	afaka miaraka aminny rehetra isika
It was a difficult time and it was very difficult.	fotoana sarotra ary tena sarotra izany
Do it one day.	ataovy izany indray andro any
I think all of these places are good.	amiko dia tsara daholo ireo toerana ireo
Maybe he needed a car for a reason.	angamba nila fiara izy noho ny antony
This has to go.	tsy maintsy mandeha ity
And it’s even worse.	ary ratsy kokoa izany
If they do, they will.	raha manao izany izy ireo dia hanao izany
You at all times.	ianao aminny fotoana rehetra
There are no more men.	tsy misy lehilahy intsony
Something is missing.	misy zavatra very
You have to be the only one.	tsy maintsy ho ianao ihany
It’s for me.	ho ahy izany
Really best way.	tena fomba tsara indrindra
There are many.	betsaka ireo
He now had to tell her.	tsy maintsy nilaza taminy izy izao
But part of it is true.	marina anefa ny ampahany aminizany
This is not difficult in general.	tsy sarotra aminny ankapobeny izany
But that can be a good thing.	mety ho zavatra tsara anefa izany
Not very pretty.	tsy tena tsara tarehy
Because of you all.	noho ianao rehetra
Everything seems more than real.	toa mihoatra noho ny tena izy ny zavadrehetra
He really didn’t know he was coming.	tena tsy fantany mihitsy hoe ho avy izy
He just knows.	fantany fotsiny
Farther and closer.	lavitra sy akaiky kokoa
It could be high, it could be low.	mety ho ambony mety ho ambany
Apparently this is not really true.	hita fa tsy tena marina izany
Or you can do it today.	na azonao atao anio
But he also thought.	nieritreritra koa anefa izy
It’s a pointless approach.	fomba tsy misy dikany izany
And there was always the next.	ary nisy foana ny manaraka
I was there for that.	teo aho noho izany
The first questions are the same.	mitovy ihany koa ireo fanontaniana voalohany
And no money, actually.	ary tsy misy vola raha ny marina
He already knows about you.	efa fantany ny momba anao
But it must be new.	fa tsy maintsy vaovao
It might be good for them.	mety ho tsara ho azy ireo izany
He will love you and you.	ho tia anao sy ianao izy
This is a good problem for him.	olana tsara ho azy izany
No, it's not too early.	tsia tsy mbola aloha loatra izany
So it doesn’t make sense to us.	noho izany dia tsy misy dikany ho antsika izany
It doesn’t matter to me right or wrong.	tsy misy dikany amiko ny tsara na ny ratsy
Not only for them but for me as well.	tsy ho azy ireo ihany fa ho ahy koa
He is the best of both worlds.	izy no tena tsara indrindra aminny tontolo roa
I will never do anything to them.	tsy hanao na inona na inona aminizy ireo mihitsy aho
I have a question about that.	manana fanontaniana iray aho momba izany
He is now lost to her.	very taminy izy izao
We still hope.	mbola manantena ihany isika
However, it works.	na izany aza dia miasa izany
You will do it anyway.	hanao izany ianao na izany aza
Two very different products.	vokatra roa tena samy hafa
There is no life.	tsy misy fiainana
It is not dead.	tsy maty izany
The earth will be emptied.	ho foana ny tany
I knew immediately what it was.	fantatro avy hatrany hoe inona izany
That’s normal, it’s not enough.	izany no mahazatra tsy ampy izany
One, and together.	iray ary miaraka
I look around.	mijery manodidina aho
It will never be again.	tsy ho izany intsony
Please see.	mba jereo
You got the best.	nahazo ny tsara indrindra ianao
The first step is the most important.	ny dingana voalohany no zavadehibe indrindra
Because if you are, you may be wrong.	satria raha ianao izany dia mety diso ianao
It’s not like me either.	tsy toa ahy koa izany
Now he has become my favorite.	aminizao fotoana izao dia lasa tiako izy
Especially women.	indrindra fa ny vehivavy
Especially with all men.	indrindra fa miaraka aminny lehilahy rehetra
No, he said, not him.	tsia hoy izy tsy izy
Yes, even one.	eny na dia iray aza
I saw action.	nahita hetsika aho
And one woman died.	ary vehivavy iray maty
No one can.	tsy misy afaka
That’s a fun thing to do.	izany no mahafinaritra atao
But he knows all the results.	fa fantany tsara ny vokatra rehetra
Not that he knew it all.	tsy hoe fantany daholo izany
Very good car.	tena fiara tsara
In fact, it’s a fun thing for them to do.	raha ny marina dia zavatra mahafinaritra azy ireo ny manao izany
I think this is the best way.	heveriko fa io no fomba tsara indrindra
I have time.	manana fotoana aho
I love when he does.	tiako rehefa manao izany izy
But there are also different opinions.	misy ihany koa anefa ny hevitra tsy mitovy
We will be here if you need anything.	ho avy eto izahay raha toa ka mila zavatra ianao
But they were there and not happy.	teo anefa izy ireo ary tsy faly
The man was already inside.	efa tao anatiny ilay lehilahy
It seems certain.	toa azo antoka izany
Something else is even more important.	mbola zavadehibe kokoa ny zavatra hafa
I'm still happy about that.	mbola faly aho aminizany
But he is gone.	saingy efa lasa izy
You don’t have to make a choice.	tsy mila manao safidy ianao
But they are all wrong.	diso daholo anefa ireo
I’m not that bad at all.	tsy ratsy toy izany rehetra izany aho
It didn’t make sense now.	tsy nisy dikany izany ankehitriny
He was new to her again.	vaovao taminy indray izy
However, he has to go the same way.	na izany aza dia tsy maintsy mandeha aminny lalana mitovy izy
It doesn't seem right.	toa tsy mety
Probably too important.	zavadehibe loatra angamba
Sometimes we are very happy.	faly be isika indraindray
No, that is a fact.	tsia zavamisy izany
He shouldn’t have started it.	tsy tokony ho nanomboka izany izy
And now someone has it.	ary ankehitriny misy manana azy
And the path is not difficult.	ary tsy sarotra ny lalana
That is not the real idea.	tsy izay no tena hevitra
He comes and we watch again.	tonga izy ary mijery indray izahay
Sounds like a fun job.	toa asa mahafinaritra
One day he was there, the next he was gone.	indray andro izy teo ny manaraka tsy teo
There is a way around it.	misy lalana manodidina izany
It’s always you too.	ianao foana koa izany
She had never seen him so happy.	mbola tsy nahita azy faly toy izany izy
It was absolutely full.	tena feno tanteraka ilay izy
I love games like that.	tiako ny lalao toy izany
He couldn't think of another place.	tsy afaka nieritreritra toerana hafa izy
We did it differently.	nanao fomba hafa izahay
It seems like too much work that I don’t like.	toa asa be loatra izany ka tsy tiako
We are really with him.	tena miaraka aminy izahay
But only he.	fa izy ihany
However, the former is better.	na izany aza tsara kokoa ny teo aloha
But, it doesn’t work for others.	saingy tsy miasa ho anny hafa
This is most common with such people.	izany no mahazatra indrindra aminny olona toy izany
She began to think about him more.	nanomboka nieritreritra momba azy bebe kokoa izy
Some information about their location.	ny vaovao sasany momba ny toerana misy azy ireo
They both looked good.	samy nijery tsara izy roa
This is especially true.	marina indrindra izany
But here’s the thing.	fa izao ny zavatra
However, nothing goes like that.	na izany aza tsy misy zavatra mandeha toy izany
There is no debate about the facts.	tsy misy ady hevitra momba ny zavamisy
To me, this is going well.	amiko aminizao fotoana izao dia mandeha tsara
I don’t want to know either.	tsy tiako ho fantany koa
Either way, there is no bigger question.	na izany na tsy izany tsy misy fanontaniana lehibe kokoa
This is not enough.	tsy ampy tanteraka izany
He had always thought about it.	efa nieritreritra izany foana izy
No one goes there.	tsy misy mandeha any
He seems to love me for a reason.	toa tia ahy izy noho ny antony
He also doesn't see much in it.	tsy mahita zavatra be ao anatiny koa izy
These may not be too far away.	mety tsy ho lavitra loatra ireo
An elderly man died.	lehilahy lehibe iray no maty
Those who can.	ireo izay afaka
You didn't stay there long either.	tsy nijanona ela tao koa ianao
The next one is coming soon !.	ho avy tsy ho ela ny manaraka
His location is certainly safe.	azo antoka fa azo antoka ny toerana misy azy
Similarly,.	mitovy aminizany
The location is also very good.	tena tsara koa ny toerana
And anything else will be.	ary na inona na inona hafa dia ho
But you will be there and they will be there.	fa ho eo ianao ary ho eo izy ireo
Simple and wordless words.	teny tsotra sy tsy misy teny
There are more men than women.	betsaka ny lehilahy noho ny vehivavy
It may be too much at first.	mety ho be loatra izany aminny voalohany
But that is not limited to each of us.	tsy momba antsika tsirairay ihany anefa izany
I think he’s fun about that.	heveriko fa mahafinaritra izy aminizany
But not everyone is the same for me.	saingy tsy ny rehetra no mitovy amiko
All that is enough.	izany rehetra izany dia efa ampy
There is something for them.	misy zavatra ho azy ireo
She is one of the most beautiful people.	iray aminireo olona tsara tarehy indrindra izy
But that’s not a big deal.	saingy tsy zavatra lehibe izany
Real question.	fanontaniana tena izy
The method is common today.	ny fomba dia mahazatra aminizao fotoana izao
There was something for everyone.	nisy zavatra ho anny rehetra
Thanks too.	misaotra ihany koa
However, it shouldn’t matter, anyway.	na izany aza tsy tokony ho zavadehibe izany na izany na tsy izany
But they are gone.	tsy eo intsony anefa izy ireo
That’s a great word.	teny lehibe izany
We can do anything.	mety hanao na inona na inona isika
For us, it’s not too bad.	ho anay tsy dia ratsy loatra izany
I've seen it before.	efa hitako aloha ilay izy
There was good and there was bad.	nisy ny tsara ary nisy ny ratsy
She looked at him thoughtfully.	nijery azy nieritreritra izy
They are the most difficult.	izy ireo no tena sarotra indrindra
I want you to do that.	tiako ianao nanao izany
No need to go alone.	tsy mila mandeha irery
Just like it was done to me.	toy ny natao tamiko
If anything, it’s real.	raha zavatra izy dia tena izy
Then someone like me.	dia nisy olona toa ahy
Many good days.	andro tsara maro
It really does.	tena manao izany
I will not be the last.	tsy ho farany aho
We had the best.	nanana ny tsara indrindra izahay
And he never had a problem.	ary tsy nanana olana mihitsy izy
Make sure you go to work well.	ataovy azo antoka fa mandeha miasa tsara ianao
And maybe some others.	ary angamba ny sasany hafa
But we don't need that here.	tsy mila izany anefa isika eto
So, we have two options.	noho izany manana safidy roa isika
Thanks for thinking of us.	misaotra nieritreritra anay
It's just not like that.	tsy toy izany fotsiny
It’s really not fun, you know.	tena tsy mahafinaritra izany fantatrao
But we saw nothing.	tsy nahita na inona na inona anefa izahay
The other one didn’t get much.	tsy nahazo be ilay iray
However, other people had similar problems.	na izany aza nisy olona hafa nanana olana mitovy aminizany
She is just as beautiful as ever.	tsara tarehy toy ny taloha ihany izy
Do what you can, of course.	ataovy izay azonao atao mazava ho azy
Now there seemed to be more than ever before.	ankehitriny dia toa mbola nisy kokoa noho ny teo aloha
We finally arrived.	tonga ihany izahay farany
Some, it’s not.	ny sasany tsy izany
And of course, it wasn’t there yet.	ary mazava ho azy fa tsy mbola teo izany
It may seem difficult, and it is true.	mety ho toa sarotra izany ary marina izany
The top of this place is huge.	ny ambony aminity toerana ity dia lehibe
But something may be right for you.	saingy misy ny mety ho marina aminao
No one does that.	tsy misy olona manao toy izany
And sometimes the story didn’t make much sense.	ary indraindray tsy dia nisy dikany ilay tantara
It told me something.	nilaza zavatra iray tamiko izany
I had no idea that opinions might be different.	tsy fantatro mihitsy fa mety ho samy hafa ny hevitra
However, there are still many problems.	na izany aza mbola misy olana maro
The house has a lot of history.	manana tantara be dia be ny trano
In fact, no.	raha ny tena izy dia tsia
It’s better to be simple.	tsara kokoa ny tsotra
Maybe they will never do that.	angamba tsy hanao izany mihitsy izy ireo
I hope others will do the same.	manantena aho fa hanao toy izany koa ny hafa
Words are the same as life.	ny teny dia mitovy aminny fiainana
Although stupid, it works well.	na dia adala aza dia miasa tsara
There are others.	mbola misy hafa koa any
As long as you love him, he will be happy.	raha mbola tia azy ianao dia ho faly izy
I prefer this one.	tiako kokoa ity
There is no other good reason.	tsy misy antony tsara hafa
That's where the problem really begins.	eo no tena manomboka ny olana
He has such a high potential.	manana ny mety ho ambony toy izany izy
It looks absolutely bad.	toa ratsy tanteraka izany
Not night but day.	tsy alina fa andro ihany
Maybe even for himself.	angamba ho anny tenany mihitsy aza
You are no longer with me.	tsy misy amiko intsony ianao
But it was almost three years ago.	saingy efa ho telo taona lasa izay
Smaller is better.	ny kely kokoa dia tsara kokoa
Now it does.	ankehitriny dia manao izany
If you are like me, you are not alone.	raha toa ahy ianao dia tsy irery
It was a wonderful night.	nahafinaritra tokoa io alina io
This process has already begun.	efa nanomboka izany dingana izany
Here is the latest picture.	ity ny sary farany indrindra
It has been there but it is not like that.	efa nisy izany fa tsy toy izany
Nothing is easy anymore.	tsy misy zavatra mora intsony
It's still okay.	mbola mety izany
Or need it.	na mila izany
So it’s good and hopeful.	noho izany dia tsara sy manantena izany
I see, in fact.	hitako raha ny marina
It didn't make sense to him at all.	tsy nisy dikany taminy mihitsy izany
But this one is different.	tsy mitovy anefa ity iray ity
Do what is done.	atao izay atao
Not because we lost ours.	tsy hoe satria very ny anay
Some didn’t even look.	tsy nijery akory ny sasany
Now is the time again.	izao indray no fotoana
Maybe they had a bad day.	angamba izy ireo dia nanana andro ratsy
Just looking for the best time.	mijery fotsiny ny fotoana tsara indrindra
Here is a fact for you.	ity misy zavamisy ho anao
It made no sense to tell him everything.	tsy nisy dikany ny nilaza taminy ny zavadrehetra
It doesn’t love you.	tsy tia anao izany
That’s where the next one is.	eo no misy ny manaraka
But I am much more than that.	saingy mihoatra lavitra noho izany aho
Just a fun place.	toerana mahafinaritra fotsiny
They told me you came.	nilaza tamiko izy ireo fa tonga ianao
And we die alone.	ary maty irery isika
The bigger, the better.	ny lehibe kokoa ny tsara kokoa
This is a problem for him.	olana ho azy izany
I don't like this guy.	tsy tiako io lehilahy io
No more time wasted.	tsy nisy fotoana very intsony
I will come too.	ho avy koa aho
I want to make good choices.	te hanao safidy tsara aho
More accurate than real.	marina kokoa noho ny tena izy
But it’s a story for another day.	saingy tantara iray ho anny andro hafa izany
But the process doesn’t seem to work for me.	toa tsy mandeha amiko anefa ilay dingana
With him watching.	miaraka aminy mijery
But, yes, it’s the same.	saingy eny mitovy ihany
It was too hard to find anything there.	sarotra loatra ny nahita zavatra tao
No one did.	tsy nisy nanao izany
He has done this many times.	efa nanao izany matetika izy
Women are a very big issue.	ny vehivavy dia tena olana lehibe
He almost deserves it.	saika mendrika izany izy
But that should be the last resort.	saingy tokony ho fomba farany izany
Maybe these places.	angamba ireo toerana ireo
Or maybe they do.	na angamba manao izany izy ireo
He is in a good position.	tsara toerana izy
The surroundings are worth it.	mendrika izany ny manodidina
It’s all about me.	momba ahy daholo izany
I love him more than ever.	tiako izy mihoatra noho ny taloha
It could be a picture.	mety ho sary izany
Yes, he did something about it.	eny nanao zavatra taminizany izy
It was a really big time.	tena fotoana lehibe tokoa izany
He couldn't seem to stop.	toa tsy afaka nijanona izy
I find them very useful.	hitako fa tena ilaina tokoa izy ireo
He did something else.	nanao zavatra hafa koa izy
I have a part of it working in part.	manana ampahany aminizany miasa aminny ampahany aho
The main road.	ny lalana lehibe
But she’s a beautiful woman down below.	saingy vehivavy tsara tarehy izy ao ambany
People can walk.	afaka mandeha ny olona
Currently there are two.	aminizao fotoana izao dia misy roa
I just knew it would be hard sometimes.	fantatro fotsiny fa ho mafy izany indraindray
That is the choice you have.	izany no safidy azonao
Yes, both are possible.	eny tokoa samy mety
But he might have told me.	mety ho nilaza tamiko anefa izy
But I wanted to be real.	te ho tena izy anefa aho
You will be there.	ho any ianao
He’s gone, gone, gone most.	lasa izy lasa lasa be indrindra
It was so fast.	haingana be ilay izy
As he went, it would be harder.	rehefa nandeha izy dia ho sarotra kokoa
This can be a real problem.	mety ho tena olana izany
I think it was a big fight.	heveriko fa ady lehibe izany
I've had good enough.	efa ampy tsara aho
Either something good or something really bad.	na zavatra tsara na zavatra tena ratsy
And maybe do something else as well.	ary angamba manao zavatra hafa koa
They are doing wrong.	manao ratsy izy ireo
We don't have enough food.	tsy ampy sakafo izahay
If you do it remotely.	raha manao izany lavitra ianao
And they can do it again.	ary afaka manao izany indray izy ireo
It's not very special.	tsy tena manokana akory izany
At first, it went a long way.	lasa lavitra ilay izy taminny voalohany
There was no other choice you could make.	tsy nisy safidy hafa azonao natao
But that will not happen in real life.	tsy ho tanteraka anefa izany eo aminny fiainana
He had never seen anything before.	mbola tsy nahita na inona na inona izy taloha
They can do many things.	afaka manao zavatra maro izy ireo
Very good drawing work.	asa sary tena tsara
They did nothing.	tsy nanao na inona na inona izy ireo
It was as if they never existed.	toy ny hoe tsy nisy mihitsy izy ireo
It is too early to be sure.	mbola aloha loatra vao azo antoka
He said it should be now.	nilaza izy fa tokony ho izao
If you have that much with you.	raha manana izany betsaka aminao ianao
Indeed, it certainly is not.	eny tokoa azo antoka fa tsy izany
This is a big step for us.	dingana lehibe ho anay izany
It’s really not ours anymore.	tena tsy antsika intsony izany
Or women in that.	na vehivavy aminizany
He needed another way.	nila fomba hafa izy
But it doesn’t matter.	saingy tsy misy zavadehibe
There was an unusual conversation.	nisy resaka tsy mahazatra
And it’s really good.	ary tena tsara tokoa
That’s what makes them fun.	izany no mahafinaritra azy ireo
It's you.	ianao ilay izy
And the next day.	ary ny andro manaraka
Not that he thought about them.	tsy hoe nieritreritra momba azy ireo izy
Thank you for telling me that.	misaotra anao nilaza izany tamiko
He does what he wants.	manao izay tiany
The important thing was that he said something.	ny zavadehibe dia hoe nilaza zavatra izy
He is one thing.	izy dia zavatra iray
This can be easily obtained as follows.	izany dia azo mora foana toy izao manaraka izao
We all watched.	nijery izahay rehetra
Not good, just good.	tsy tsara tsara fotsiny
And everyone looked good.	ary nijery tsara ny rehetra
It’s almost never going to be in a worse place.	saika tsy ho any aminny toerana ratsy kokoa izany
Full house.	trano feno
This is not a bad result, but a good result.	tsy vokatra ratsy izany fa vokatra tsara
It couldn’t be any different.	tsy mety ho hafa izany
All that, if you will.	izany rehetra izany raha tianao
But no one saw us.	tsy nisy nahita anefa izahay
You will be very beautiful.	ho tena tsara tarehy ianao
But they are all dead.	fa efa maty daholo
But that is also the problem.	izany koa anefa no olana
The money is mine.	ahy ny vola
There was no distance.	tsy nisy lavitra intsony
And no cars.	ary tsy misy fiara
People love them.	tia azy ireo ny olona
And we can do the same in time.	ary afaka manao toy izany koa isika aminny fotoana
And that’s good news for me too.	ary vaovao tsara ho ahy koa izany
It is not necessary at all.	tsy ilaina mihitsy izany
This is true in part, but only in part.	marina taminny ampahany izany fa ampahany ihany
Yes, do it.	eny ataovy izany
And we are not men.	ary tsy lehilahy izahay
This thing is really good.	tena tsara ity zavatra ity
It seems clear that this idea is true.	toa mazava fa marina io hevitra io
I used to look at them a little.	nijery azy ireo kely aho taloha
Not one is wrong.	tsy diso na dia iray aza
Nothing important, but not bad either.	tsy misy zavadehibe fa tsy ratsy koa
Maybe they loved him once, but look at him now.	angamba izy ireo tia azy indray mandeha fa jereo izy izao
You deserve what comes to you.	mendrika izay ho avy aminao ianao
That is the talk of the world.	izany no resaka eto aminity tontolo ity
But that, too, goes beyond that.	fa izany koa mihoatra lavitra
No one sees you here.	tsy misy mahita anao eto
He really liked the house.	tena tiany ilay trano
There he went.	teo izy no nandeha
He will love me.	ho tia ahy izy
Either way, the timing is not the same.	na izany na tsy izany tsy mitovy ny fotoana
I have the following problem.	manana ity olana manaraka ity aho
But I need to do something.	mila manao zavatra aho anefa
I can't do it there.	tsy afaka manao izany any
i just know what it is.	fantatro fotsiny hoe inona izao
He is free now.	afaka izy izao
This was very new to me.	tena vaovao tamiko izany
One day he said he saw her.	indray andro dia nilaza izy fa nahita azy
This is my first day.	andro voalohany ho ahy izao
But nothing mattered to the two of us.	saingy tsy nisy zavadehibe ho anay roa
There are some ways around of course.	misy fomba sasany manodidina mazava ho azy
He just needed to see.	nila nahita fotsiny izy
You really don’t want to do that.	tena tsy te hanao izany ianao
No one else, no one else.	tsy nisy hafa tsy nisy hafa
This idea is true no matter what.	marina io hevitra io na inona na inona
He knows where everything is.	fantany ny misy ny zavadrehetra
He should have looked more closely at other options.	tokony ho nijery akaiky kokoa ny safidy hafa izy
But they don't agree with me.	tsy mitovy hevitra amiko anefa izy ireo
Well, that's two.	eny ary roa izany
There can be a time and place for everything.	mety hisy fotoana sy toerana ho anny zavadrehetra
And that’s also really good.	ary izany koa dia tena tsara
That’s the best part.	izany no tena tsara
There is such a small part.	misy ampahany kely toy izany
There could have been many reasons.	mety nisy antony maro be
But right now, he’s also the best for me.	saingy aminizao fotoana izao izy koa no tsara indrindra amiko
So, happy to be just getting started.	noho izany faly ho vao manomboka
It will not be for us.	tsy ho antsika izany
But not everyone.	tsy ny tsirairay anefa
The location is easily accessible from here.	ny toerana dia mora azo avy eto
But we are wrong.	diso lalana anefa isika
He was far from alone at the time.	lavitra irery izy taminizany
You are still new to this.	mbola vaovao ianao aminity
He will come anytime now.	ho avy izy aminny fotoana rehetra izao
But it is a simple task.	asa tsotra anefa izany
She is beautiful and lonely.	tsara tarehy sy irery izy
That doesn't seem like a bad thing, he thought.	toa tsy zavatra ratsy izany hoy izy nieritreritra
You may be able to do something similar.	mety ho afaka hanao zavatra toy izany ianao
Not enough information.	tsy ampy ny vaovao
Start at the top.	manomboka eo ambony
Neither should we.	tsy tokony ho toy izany koa isika
As for you, especially.	raha ny momba anao indrindra
But he is gone.	efa lasa anefa izy
Not yet, however.	tsy mbola na izany aza
At most, two days.	raha be indrindra roa andro
I have seen this many times.	efa hitako matetika izany
It’s just a little too much for me.	somary kely fotsiny izany ho ahy
Couldn't take a step.	tsy afaka nanao dingana iray
Or close to none.	na akaiky tsy misy
And don't do that.	ary aza manao toy izany
This is where you should come from.	eto ianao no tokony ho tonga
A man your age.	lehilahy mitovy taona aminao
You are so important.	tena zavadehibe loatra ianao
And we got there.	ary tonga tany izahay
None of them have.	tsy misy aminizy ireo manana
We don't need anyone.	tsy mila olona izahay
Maybe not you.	mety tsy ianao
If you want to.	raha izay no tianao
We are always from here.	avy eto foana izahay
I will be free.	ho afaka aho
It’s a big world.	tontolo lehibe izany
He had something good for him.	nanana zavatra tsara ho azy izy
Yes, he said, in the end.	eny hoy izy taminny farany
There are a variety of possible ways.	misy karazana fomba azo atao
But many have done the same.	maro koa anefa no nanao izany
You want to do something else.	te hanao zavatra hafa ianao
You can't have both.	tsy afaka manana ny roa
It is not lost.	tsy very izany
But that never happened.	tsy tonga intsony anefa izany

Of course it is possible.	mazava ho azy fa mety izany
You have the potential.	manana ny mety ianao

Then it starts to make sense.	dia manomboka misy dikany izany
I may have known that it wouldn’t have happened.	mety ho fantatro fa tsy ho tanteraka izany
It seems real to me.	toa tena misy izany amiko
As before, he didn't look around.	toy ny teo aloha dia tsy nijery manodidina izy
And so he had to see her.	ary noho izany dia tsy maintsy nahita azy izy
With you.	miaraka aminao
It’s too big for them.	lehibe loatra ho azy ireo izany

But it is possible.	tena azo atao anefa
Some people do it better, some people have more problems.	ny olona sasany dia manao izany tsara kokoa ny olona sasany dia manana olana bebe kokoa
The issue here is not the same.	tsy mitovy ny resaka eto
He had to do it in the end.	tsy maintsy nanao izany taminny farany izy
So first, you have to start with the easy one.	noho izany aloha tsy maintsy manomboka aminny iray mora ianao
They are doing well.	manao tsara izy ireo

He was thinking of a house, the last house.	nieritreritra trano iray izy ilay trano farany indrindra
You have the world, and there is another world.	manana izao tontolo izao ianao ary misy izao tontolo izao hafa
Everything else is just a little bit.	ny zavatra hafa rehetra dia kely fotsiny
That goes with everything in life.	izany dia miaraka aminny zavadrehetra eo aminny fiainana
In the world.	eo aminizao tontolo izao
I think he might even love you a little.	heveriko fa mety ho tia anao kely aza izy
There was a process.	nisy dingana
You to everyone.	ianao aminny olona rehetra
Bad, but we’re not at our best.	ratsy fa tsy aminny tsara indrindra izahay
But work is not the only thing that matters.	tsy ny asa ihany anefa no zavadehibe
Looks like it is.	toa izay no izy
It will be better for you and for him.	ho tsara kokoa ho anao sy ho azy izany
There must be something up there.	tsy maintsy misy zavatra any ambony any
There was not much space.	tsy nisy toerana be
But they could not be any different.	tsy afaka ny ho hafa kokoa anefa izy ireo
He is mine too.	ahy koa izy
But he was bad and he knew it.	ratsy anefa izy ary fantany izany
It seems closer.	toa akaiky kokoa izany
But not just one.	fa tsy iray ihany

This can be wrong and sometimes.	mety ho diso izany ary indraindray
You are too big a woman for me.	vehivavy lehibe loatra amiko ianao
They are full of war.	feno ady izy ireo

Quite a bit, but generally a good guy.	somary kely fa aminny ankapobeny dia lehilahy tsara
When you grow up, you will get it.	rehefa lehibe ianao dia ho azonao
I don’t know the ups and downs.	tsy fantatro ny ambony ambany

Those with me and him.	ireo miaraka amiko sy aminy
Works fine without it.	miasa tsara tsy misy azy io
We don’t, of course.	tsy manao izany izahay mazava ho azy
Nothing more and nothing bigger.	tsy misy intsony ary tsy misy lehibe kokoa
One of his maybe.	iray aminny azy angamba
So it went well.	ka dia nandeha tsara ilay izy
But it doesn’t go that way.	saingy tsy mandeha aminizany fomba izany
Maybe not you, you know.	mety tsy ianao fantatrao
He does nothing else.	tsy manao zavatra hafa izy

Just to be different.	mba ho hafa ihany
We are for them.	ho azy ireo isika

And a beautiful woman.	ary vehivavy tsara tarehy

And neither will it in the future.	ary tsy hisy koa izany aminny ho avy

I started to see things like that.	nanomboka nahita zavatra toy izany aho
This is not a bad deed.	tsy asa ratsy izany
But not at first.	tsy taminny voalohany anefa
Sounds great.	toa tsara be
Now he really did.	ankehitriny dia tena nanao izany izy
Or in.	na aminny

If there is no other option.	raha tsy misy safidy hafa
It's up front.	eo aloha izany
Otherwise you are wrong.	raha tsy izany dia diso ianao
And now they are dead.	ary ankehitriny dia maty izy ireo

I had never really been like that before.	mbola tsy tena nisy toy izany mihitsy aho taloha
In fact, it starts with that.	raha ny marina manomboka aminizany
But for now.	fa aminizao fotoana izao
I hope he is in the right place.	manantena aho fa any aminny toerana tsara izy
It wasn’t much but enough.	tsy dia be ilay izy fa ampy
That’s all I have.	izany no zavadrehetra ahy
But even that is not enough.	saingy na dia izany aza dia tsy ampy
But to him.	fa aminy
They do not love others.	tsy tia ny hafa izy ireo
They are not bad.	tsy ratsy izy ireo
And he, he knows, does it more.	ary izy fantany izany dia manao izany bebe kokoa
Whether something works or not.	na misy zavatra mandeha na tsia
In this life there is nothing.	aminity fiainana ity dia tsy misy na inona na inona
However, you have to get information.	na izany aza dia tsy maintsy mahazo vaovao ianao
They are fast and easy.	haingana sy mora izy ireo
I'm glad you like it.	faly aho fa tianao izany
It's too hard to see anything.	mafy loatra ka tsy mahita na inona na inona

They work first.	miasa aloha izy ireo
There are many more.	misy maro hafa koa
Yes, and others.	eny ary ny hafa
She’s not a simple woman so for sure.	tsy vehivavy tsotra izy ka azo antoka

This is not fast food.	tsy sakafo haingana izany
Now there was a new problem.	ankehitriny dia nisy olana vaovao
They look like crazy people.	toa olona adala izy ireo
And what a game that is.	ary lalao inona izany
I should see that in the future.	tokony ho hitako izany ho avy
However, one of them.	na izany aza ny iray aminizy ireo
I had to do it.	tsy maintsy nanao izany aho
Or yours.	na ny aminao
It's time for me.	fotoana izao ho ahy
Someone, he knew personally.	olona iray fantany manokana
They were there for him.	teo izy ireo ho azy
A small portion also died.	ny ampahany kely ihany koa no maty
Kind of has to be something.	ny karazana dia tokony ho zavatra
He was also confused.	very hevitra koa izy
I would be confused.	ho very hevitra aho
I don’t always like that.	tsy tiako foana izany
It all seems so fun.	toa mahafinaritra tokoa izany rehetra izany
There was one.	nisy iray
I am well aware of this fact.	fantatro tsara io zavamisy io
For me personally.	amiko manokana io
So, that’s really good.	noho izany tena tsara izany
We are not far from the place.	tsy lavitra ny toerana izahay
I could still do it now.	mbola afaka nanao izany aho izao
You are dead.	efa maty ianao
Yes, not stupid at all.	eny tsy adala mihitsy
The best pictures are yet to come.	mbola ho avy ny sary tsara indrindra
He stood firm.	nijanona mafy izy
That is the choice.	izany no safidy
Make it very clear.	ataovy mazava tsara izany
As every woman should be.	toy ny tokony ho ny vehivavy tsirairay
This is so beautiful.	tena tsara tarehy ity
To me, that makes sense.	amiko dia misy dikany izany
I really exist now.	tena misy aho izao
This is very quick and easy to do.	tena haingana sy mora atao izany
And easier.	ary mora kokoa
You know the story well.	fantatrao tsara ny tantara
When you are wrong in any way.	rehefa diso ianao aminny fomba rehetra

Some are very special.	ny sasany dia tena manokana
This is not a good day.	tsy andro tsara izao
Of course, you are still losing money.	mazava ho azy fa mbola very vola ianao
It’s hard to do things sometimes.	sarotra ny manao zavatra indraindray
But that is not the case.	tsy izay anefa no tena zavamisy
I should have thought.	tokony ho nieritreritra aho
The result is minimal.	ny vokatra dia kely indrindra
They are beautiful people.	olona tsara tarehy izy ireo
While this is safe, it can be very difficult.	na dia azo antoka aza izany dia mety ho sarotra be izany
I am no different.	tsy hafa aho
Did it again, too.	nanao izany indray toy izany koa
You will love more.	ho tia kokoa ianao
We were in the same place.	teo aminny toerana iray ihany izahay
Everything else is unnecessary.	ny hafa rehetra dia tsy ilaina
He himself has to do it.	izy mihitsy no tsy maintsy manao izany
Not another word from me.	tsy teny hafa avy amiko
Some go without looking.	ny sasany mandeha tsy mijery
The process is the same, the results are different.	mitovy ny dingana samy hafa ny vokatra
Maybe in a small way.	angamba aminny resaka kely
All of this was meaningless.	tsy nisy dikany izany rehetra izany
I look at him but he no longer sees me.	mijery azy aho fa tsy mahita ahy intsony izy
None of the dead are walking, no matter what.	tsy misy na iray aza aminireo maty mandeha na inona na inona izy
This is the general method.	izany no fomba ankapobeny
The latter is very important.	tena zavadehibe ny farany
I have never seen anything like them.	mbola tsy nahita toa azy ireo aho
He who does his best does his best work.	izay manao ny tsara indrindra dia manao ny asa tsara indrindra
In fact, neither are we.	raha ny marina tsy izahay koa
And finally, here we are.	ary farany eto isika
But there, everyone seems to me.	fa any toa ahy daholo ny olona rehetra
First, it’s not just a money issue.	voalohany tsy olana aminny vola fotsiny izany
So maybe we are the only ones needed.	ka angamba isika ihany no ilaina
But we can do better.	saingy afaka manao zavatra tsara kokoa isika
No one is superior.	tsy misy olona ambony
Don’t do that, especially if you’re just starting out.	aza manao izany indrindra fa vao manomboka ianao
It is far from you.	lavitra anao izany
All that, and something else.	izany rehetra izany ary zavatra hafa
But they are generally very close.	tena akaiky anefa izy ireo aminny ankapobeny
However, we are not going that route here.	na izany aza tsy mandeha io lalana io eto izahay
You know some of them.	fantatrao ny sasany aminizy ireo
Yes, they are gone.	eny lasa izy ireo
We all need people.	mila olona isika rehetra
And often.	ary matetika
When it comes to the end, start all over again.	rehefa tonga aminny farany dia manomboka indray
But he can't do me.	saingy tsy afaka manao ahy izy
They are great people who do great events as well.	izy ireo dia olona lehibe izay manao hetsika lehibe ihany koa
I also met many other people.	nahita olona maro hafa koa aho
Someone my age.	olona mitovy taona amiko
It will only appear there once.	indray mandeha ihany no ho hita eo
In fact, that is not at all the case.	raha ny marina tsy izany mihitsy no zavamisy
Great place for photos.	toerana mahafinaritra ho anny sary
But it’s not so clear.	saingy tsy dia mazava loatra
He did, but it wasn’t there.	nanao izany izy saingy tsy teo ihany
I have to do what he wants.	tsy maintsy manao izay tiany aho
We were both very happy with the final result.	faly be izahay roa taminny vokatra farany
The information should be easily accessible.	ny vaovao dia tokony ho mora azo
But they are not enough.	tsy ampy anefa izy ireo
Whatever day it is.	na inona na inona andro izao
It’s really bad though.	tena ratsy izany na izany aza
They get everything.	mahazo ny zavadrehetra izy ireo
But we have not lost anything.	tsy misy very na inona na inona anefa izahay
And they just want to do it, you know.	ary te hanao izany fotsiny izy ireo fantatrao
And you will know.	ary ho fantatrao
Good as the picture.	tsara toy ny sary
In this earth.	aminity tany ity
But only the game.	fa ny lalao ihany
Or he might come here.	na mety ho tonga eto izy
In my opinion, not much different.	raha ny hevitra tsy dia hafa loatra
We have two main products.	manana vokatra roa lehibe isika
Yours too.	ny anao koa
Only occasionally.	indraindray ihany
This is a very important job.	asa tena ilaina izany
Too much on men.	be loatra eny lehilahy
Then the real journey begins.	dia manomboka ny tena dia
I need you.	mila anao aho
Not just in the future but now.	tsy aminny fotoana ho avy ihany fa aminizao fotoana izao
I have a little time.	manana fotoana kely aho
So they are safer.	noho izany dia azo antoka kokoa izy ireo
However, it is very much so.	na izany aza dia tena toy izany
Great thing, he said.	zavatra lehibe hoy izy
But both have to go it alone.	fa samy tsy maintsy mandeha irery
I was just not there.	tsy teo fotsiny aho
Either way, this is enough.	na izany na tsy izany dia ampy izao
No one can do that for us.	tsy misy afaka manao izany ho antsika
And it’s from me.	ary avy amiko izany
He will never make history.	tsy hanao tantara mihitsy izy
We have them all the time.	manana azy ireo isika aminny fotoana rehetra
Great is great, no matter what.	lehibe dia lehibe na inona na inona
There were almost no other houses in the area.	saika tsy nisy trano hafa teny aminny manodidina
I hope this one is great.	manantena aho fa lehibe ity iray ity
We were adults, once.	olona lehibe izahay indray mandeha
Maybe he did.	angamba izy no nanao izany
It seems to be easy.	toa ho mora izany
He shouldn’t love her.	tsy tokony ho tia azy izy
But we can be more.	mety ho bebe kokoa anefa isika
Enough for you ?.	ampy ho anao
This is one of many reasons.	antony iray aminny maro izany
Even if you don’t know it yet.	na dia mbola tsy fantatrao aza izany
The bad here, however, is really bad.	ny ratsy eto anefa dia tena ratsy
It would have been as if it had never happened.	ho toy ny tsy nisy mihitsy izany fotoana izany
These are fun, simple and straightforward.	ireo dia mahafinaritra tsotra ary tsotra
This is true, but not all.	marina izany fa tsy ny rehetra
He should know now.	tokony ho fantany izao
But, so we have another battle.	saingy noho izany dia mbola misy ady hafa indray isika
Sometimes not.	indraindray tsy misy
But three years later, there was a problem.	saingy rehefa afaka telo taona dia nisy olana
But this is not wrong either.	tsy diso koa anefa izany
But this is old news.	vaovao taloha anefa ity
He did so without even thinking.	nanao izany tsy nieritreritra akory izy
Really hard work.	tena miasa mafy
He had a job.	nanana asa izy
People can’t.	tsy azo atao ny olona
I never thought of anything like that.	tsy nieritreritra zavatra toy izany mihitsy aho
You don’t do that right now.	tsy manao izany ianao aminizao fotoana izao
But that may not have been too long.	saingy tsy mety ho efa ela be izany
So that’s about it.	ka izay ny momba azy
She is more than just a beautiful face.	mihoatra lavitra noho ny tarehy tsara tarehy fotsiny izy
There must be a right path.	tsy maintsy misy ny lalana marina
The trip was well worth it.	tena mendrika ilay dia
He is simple.	izy dia tsotra
He saw a lot but not enough.	nahita be dia be izy fa tsy tsy ampy
He is now enough for enough people.	efa ampy ho anny olona ampy izy izao
Nothing remained there.	tsy nisy na inona na inona nijanona teo
It’s more fun to walk.	mahafinaritra kokoa ny mandeha
We were in different places.	tany aminny toerana samy hafa izahay
They want to be.	te ho izy ireo
Because that’s the thing.	satria izay no zavatra
He was on top.	izy no teo ambony
And there is something completely different about him now.	ary misy zavatra hafa tanteraka momba azy ankehitriny
It’s all good stuff.	zavatra tsara daholo
We haven't seen another car in a long time.	efa ela izahay no tsy nahita fiara hafa
There was no time for anything else.	tsy nisy fotoana ho anny zavatra hafa
It doesn’t make much sense to me.	tsy dia misy dikany amiko izany
He didn’t know that part.	tsy fantany io ampahany io
Not even close, absolutely.	tsy akaiky akory tanteraka
Or maybe you are the person.	na angamba ianao no ilay olona
The biggest problem is, of course, money.	ny olana lehibe indrindra dia mazava ho azy ny vola
At all times now.	aminny fotoana rehetra izao
I don’t like him at all.	tsy tiako mihitsy izy
It was like he was going fast no matter what.	toy ny nandeha haingana izy na inona
The choice seems pointless.	toa tsy misy dikany ny safidy
I enjoyed it too.	nahafinaritra ahy koa izany
But you know it all.	fa fantatrao izany rehetra izany
I'm lost in this thing.	very aho aminity zavatra ity
It seems to be the same.	toa iray ihany ilay izy
They looked more.	nijery bebe kokoa izy ireo
I went to him there.	nandeha azy tany aho
They deserve it.	mendrika izy ireo
I could not see clearly.	tsy nahita mazava tsara aho
They don't come here.	tsy tonga eto izy ireo
I enjoy everything in life.	mahafinaritra ahy ny zavadrehetra eo aminny fiainana
It’s an easy job.	asa mora izany
But others are obviously not.	saingy ny hafa dia mazava ho azy fa tsy izany
He does not love us.	tsy tia antsika izy
He looked around as if to see.	nijery manodidina toy ny mahita izy
There is always something about him.	misy foana ny momba azy
However, this is not uncommon.	tsy dia mahazatra anefa izany
But don't go too far.	fa aza mandeha lavitra
But all of this is true.	marina daholo anefa izany
But it is impossible to dislike him.	tsy azo atao anefa ny tsy tia azy
I'm confused about him.	very hevitra momba azy aho
It’s too much now.	efa betsaka loatra izany ankehitriny
I didn't think of anything else.	tsy nieritreritra zavatra hafa
There are a lot of people that are.	be dia be ny olona izay
I see everything.	hitako ny zavadrehetra
He never did.	tsy mba nanao izany mihitsy izy
As to the previous facts,.	momba ny zavamisy teo aloha
He never thought.	tsy nieritreritra mihitsy izy
They never came.	tsy tonga mihitsy izy ireo
You get it fast.	mahazo haingana ianao
You know what’s next.	fantatrao izay manaraka
In the past.	raha ny taloha
Or maybe not.	na mety tsy izany
He will do nothing.	tsy hanao na inona na inona izy
And you enjoyed it.	ary nahafinaritra anao izany
You are not personal.	tsy ianao manokana
The latter was made for me.	ny farany dia natao ho ahy
He would see them again.	ho nahita azy ireo indray izy
Nothing works for me.	tsy misy miasa amiko
It was an easy thing to do.	zavatra mora ilay izy
There was even talk of money.	nisy mihitsy ny resaka vola
Now, this option looks good.	ankehitriny ity safidy ity dia mijery tsara
There is only one thing wrong with him.	iray ihany no tsy mety aminy
But here comes one of them.	saingy tonga eto ny iray aminireo
Probably not many.	tsy maro angamba
One night was enough.	ampy izay ilay alina iray
The cars look new.	toa vaovao ireo fiara
There will be a way.	hisy lalana
My old one.	ny ahy taloha
War is not right, but only for a reason.	tsy mety ny ady fa noho ny antony ihany
They are not and never will be.	tsy izy ireo ary tsy hisy mihitsy
But it is very easy.	tena mora anefa izany
Now, more than ever, he is alone.	ankehitriny mihoatra noho ny taloha dia irery izy
For me, life is not so great.	raha ny amiko tsy dia lehibe loatra ny fiainana
It is completely full.	feno tanteraka izy io
Look around, they say.	jereo ny manodidina hoy izy ireo
But nothing was found there.	tsy nisy zavatra hita anefa tao
Make it harder than it should be.	ataovy sarotra kokoa noho ny tokony ho izy izany
There were events at night.	nisy ny hetsika aminny alina
I should have loved seeing them.	tokony ho tiako ny nahita azy ireo
There were all sorts of facts about it.	tena nisy ny zavamisy rehetra momba izany
These are not good things.	tsy zavatra tsara ireo
It must have been fun.	nahafinaritra angamba ilay izy
They can be very difficult.	mety ho sarotra be izy ireo
No bad words.	tsy misy teny ratsy
This is the best time of the year.	io no fotoana tsara indrindra aminny taona
I think there is a reason for everything in life.	heveriko fa misy antony ny zavadrehetra eo aminny fiainana
Now it is here.	ankehitriny dia eto
Of course you can come.	mazava ho azy fa afaka tonga ianao
But many more do not.	mbola betsaka kokoa anefa no tsy manao izany
I don't see the point.	tsy hitako ny hevitra
We don’t need more.	tsy mila bebe kokoa isika
He must be dead.	tokony ho efa maty izy
Now, for good.	ankehitriny ho anny zavatra tsara
But for now that is all.	fa aminizao fotoana izao dia izay ihany
From all over at once.	avy aminny toerana rehetra indray mandeha
And it really does everything perfectly.	ary tena manao tanteraka ny zavadrehetra
That’s a good idea you know.	hevitra tsara fantatrao izany
But it belongs to women.	fa anny vehivavy izany
I really hope you enjoyed it.	tena manantena aho fa nahafinaritra anao izany
But that seems important.	toa zavadehibe anefa izany
But that is a misconception.	saingy diso hevitra izany
Good first step.	dingana voalohany tsara
Then, you don’t have to look at them.	avy eo tsy mila mijery azy ireo ianao
But he could say it would not be enough.	saingy afaka nilaza izy fa tsy ho ampy izany
Had little trouble.	tsy nanana olana kely
He didn’t want to know.	tsy tiany ho fantany
Otherwise, you will never know.	raha tsy izany dia tsy ho fantatrao mihitsy
Same goes for the better.	mitovy ary ny mety ho tsara kokoa aminizany
The house is definitely the best place.	azo antoka fa ny trano no toerana tsara indrindra
Very hard working.	tena natao mafy
This is very unusual there.	tena tsy mahazatra izany any
Everything else is fine.	tsara daholo ny zavatra hafa rehetra
You are wrong for others.	diso hevitra ho anny hafa ianao
Finally he did.	farany dia nanao izany izy
But he came to the right place.	saingy tonga teo aminny toerana mety izy
It’s fun at times.	mahafinaritra indraindray
One on one day, another on another day.	iray aminny andro iray iray hafa aminny andro hafa
They seem too good to be true.	toa tsara loatra izy ireo raha ny marina
He had a small part, but stayed with you.	nanana ampahany kely izy saingy nijanona teo aminao
He has a fun process.	manana dingana mahafinaritra izy
You were there when they were seen again.	tany ianao rehefa hita indray izy ireo
This may not be an easy task.	tsy mety ho asa mora izany
I think they should, though.	heveriko fa tokony ho izy ireo anefa
It’s just a fun story.	tantara mahafinaritra fotsiny ilay izy
However, it didn’t make sense.	na izany aza tsy nisy dikany izany
You are crazy.	adala ianao
But I got into trouble.	tonga aminny olana anefa aho
You can come too, if you like.	afaka tonga koa ianao raha tianao
It seems more common.	toa mahazatra kokoa izany
There was really no question.	tena tsy nisy fanontaniana
But now he is alone.	irery anefa izy izao
He is alone in the world.	irery izy eto aminizao tontolo izao
But he is no longer.	saingy tsy izy intsony
At all times, really.	aminny fotoana rehetra tena
And everything should be fine.	ary tokony ho tsara ny zavadrehetra
You know what that thing is.	fantatrao hoe inona izany zavatra izany
If that makes sense to you.	raha misy dikany aminao izany
But once he arrived, it was something else.	raha vao tonga anefa izy dia zavatra hafa ilay izy
But they both couldn’t have it.	saingy tsy afaka nanana izy roa
But you don’t really know that very well.	saingy tsy tena fantatrao tsara izany
We need to get closer to them.	mila akaiky kokoa azy ireo isika
It will be the same as before.	ho toy ny teo aloha ihany izany
The process takes time, of course.	mila fotoana ny dingana mazava ho azy
It works when you really are.	miasa izy io rehefa tena ianao
Some are similar.	toy izany koa ny sasany
So, now it’s gone.	noho izany izao dia tsy misy intsony
You may be alone, but not alone.	mety ho irery ianao fa tsy irery
And there were times.	ary nisy izany indraindray
Not very happy with that.	tsy dia faly aminizany
Of course, this is not the end.	mazava ho azy fa tsy izany no farany
I can't seem to work properly.	toa tsy afaka miasa tsara aho
You don't need anything.	tsy mila na inona na inona
Not in this world or in the future.	tsy aminizao tontolo izao na aminny ho avy
And it follows.	ary manaraka izany
He immediately looked at me in the picture.	nijery ahy avy hatrany izy taminny sary
It’s very self -assured.	tena azo antoka ny tenany
Don’t expect anything.	aza manantena na inona na inona
But one of them is of course superior.	saingy ny iray aminizy ireo dia mazava ho azy fa ambony
At one time the earth will be completely filled.	aminny fotoana iray dia ho feno tokoa ny tany
And yet, they don’t matter.	ary na izany aza tsy zavadehibe izy ireo
Probably not the best, but still.	angamba tsy ny tsara indrindra fa mbola
Or just one day.	na indray andro ihany
Not very common.	tsy dia mahazatra
There was always war.	nisy ady foana tao
So much for a good job.	be dia be noho ny asa tsara
He didn't see her either.	tsy nahita azy koa izy
Of course, there is none.	mazava ho azy fa tsy misy izany
Yes, if he is right for me.	eny raha izy no mety amiko
I hope no one will ever do that.	manantena aho fa tsy hisy hanao izany mihitsy
If he can see me now.	raha afaka mahita ahy izy izao
He was also confused at first.	very hevitra koa izy taminny voalohany
But both facts seem entirely certain.	saingy ny zavamisy roa dia toa azo antoka tanteraka
I got to the bottom.	tonga any aminny farany ambany aho
Many of them are.	maro aminizy ireo no
He doesn't seem to exist.	toa tsy misy izy
Make them as clear as possible.	ataovy mazava tsara araka izay azo atao izy ireo
It remains to be seen whether you can or not.	mbola ho hita eo na afaka na tsia
i really like it.	tiako be io
This is often very difficult.	matetika izany no tena sarotra
Great car.	fiara be
Even men.	na dia lehilahy aza
The world has an average.	izao tontolo izao dia manana eo ho eo
It’s next year.	aminny taona manaraka izany
They work like this.	miasa toy izao izy ireo
These are things that can be hard to do.	ireo dia zavatra mety ho sarotra atao
Now is a great time for him.	fotoana lehibe ho azy izao
He was a little unhappy at first.	somary tsy faly izy taminny voalohany
And you can too.	ary mety koa ianao
I like cars.	tia fiara aho
What’s so fun about that ?.	inona no mahafinaritra aminizany
I don’t really do that.	tsy tena manao izany aho
Worse than you work.	ratsy noho ny hoe miasa ianao
They are two completely different ideas.	hevitra roa samy hafa tanteraka izy ireo
Because we love him.	satria tia azy izahay
This is a fun easy thing to do.	ity dia zavatra mora atao mahafinaritra
In other words, not too much.	aminny teny hafa tsy dia be loatra
A lot of things are going on.	betsaka ny zavatra mandeha
There had to be someone and it was.	tsy maintsy nisy olona ary izy io
That's right, three.	marina izany telo
Which is really good for me.	izay tena tsara amiko
He once told me that.	nilaza izany tamiko izy indray mandeha
You need to get more.	mila mahazo bebe kokoa ianao
Especially since no one knows.	indrindra fa tsy misy fantany
There was no more money.	tsy nisy vola intsony
There was no end to it.	tsy nisy farany izany
They go straight to the usual endless place.	mandeha avy hatrany any aminny toerana tsy misy farany mahazatra izy ireo
And these are very true.	ary tena marina tokoa ireo
But the reality is very different.	hafa loatra anefa ny zavamisy
I see it coming soon.	hitako fa ho avy tsy ho ela izany
In fact, he has nothing.	raha ny marina dia tsy manana na inona na inona izy
So for us, it’s hard to get.	ka ho antsika dia sarotra ny mahazo azy
But he just stares.	mijery fotsiny anefa izy
But, now, he is gone.	saingy izao dia lasa izy
The money has arrived.	tonga ny vola
So the big problem.	noho izany ny olana lehibe
They are part of me.	ampahany amiko izy ireo
He had every reason.	nanana ny antony rehetra izy
She can't love him for long.	tsy afaka tia azy ela izy
Others don’t go either.	ny hafa dia tsy mandeha koa
As they should be.	araka ny tokony ho izy ireo
But this movement works.	miasa anefa ity hetsika ity
We always get them.	mahazo azy ireo foana izahay
Everything started to go fast.	nanomboka nandeha haingana ny zavadrehetra
He knows the word about it.	fantany ny teny momba izany
There was a small problem.	nisy olana kely iray
Some people may not be free from such work.	mety hisy olona tsy ho afaka aminny asa toy izany
And often, very hard.	ary matetika tena mafy
But there are still questions.	mbola misy fanontaniana anefa
Do it the right way.	ataovy aminny fomba tsara izany
And often it will be a process.	ary matetika dia ho dingana izany
I think it’s getting really hard.	heveriko fa lasa mafy be ilay izy
And not all of them do.	ary tsy izy rehetra no manao izany
He may even be superior to me.	mety ho ambony amiko mihitsy aza izy
But there are a lot of people.	be dia be anefa ny olona
She seemed very happy with herself.	toa faly be taminny tenany izy
You are different from the old people.	tsy mitovy aminny olona taloha ianao
We see something, and we want to do it.	mahita zavatra isika ary te hanao izany
No one did that completely.	tsy nisy olona nanao toy izany tanteraka
No one is happy to do that.	tsy misy olona faly manao izany
He draws.	manao sary izy
I'm glad you do '.	faly aho raha manao izany ianao
He was very good with women.	tena tsara taminny vehivavy izy
He may not do that.	mety tsy hanao izany izy
But there is only one reason.	antony iray ihany anefa izany
It’s always hard work.	asa sarotra foana izany
We may still need it.	mety mbola mila azy isika
This is not a path for people.	tsy lalana ho anny olona ity
But he can do it all.	saingy afaka manao izany rehetra izany izy
The first thing.	ny zavatra voalohany
This is another world.	tontolo hafa izao
That may be true, he said.	mety ho marina izany hoy izy
But of course they can draw too.	saingy mazava ho azy fa afaka manao sary ihany koa izy ireo
There is no place here.	tsy misy toerana eto
Although too often, they don’t.	na dia matetika loatra aza dia tsy manao izany izy ireo
You don’t have to work hard for it.	tsy mila miasa mafy ho azy ianao
For everyone, it is a choice.	ho anny rehetra dia safidy izany
I think everyone did a great job.	heveriko fa nanao asa lehibe ny rehetra
And that’s what he really likes.	ary izany no tena tiany
This one is going to be easy.	ity iray ity dia ho mora
It’s more than that.	mihoatra izany
It’s become really big.	lasa lehibe tokoa izany
You can come when you want.	mety ho tonga ianao rehefa tianao
You may have met someone.	efa mahita olona angamba ianao
He is a big problem.	olana lehibe izy
Some love work, others don’t.	ny sasany tia asa ny hafa tsy dia tia
However, it can be a bit simplistic.	na izany aza mety ho somary tsotra izany
It’s even worse.	ratsy mihitsy aza izany
It’s a very small thing.	zavatra tena kely izany
Maybe they did.	angamba nanao izany izy ireo
Maybe you’re doing a good job but not a good one.	angamba ianao manao asa tsara fa tsy tsara
I know these things.	fantatro ireo zavatra ireo
There are two cars.	misy fiara roa
To me, it’s that simple.	amiko dia tsotra izany
I have never seen them.	mbola tsy nahita azy ireo mihitsy
In other words, nothing.	aminny teny hafa tsy misy na inona na inona
So I did the same.	dia nanao izany koa aho
He is good to me.	tsara amiko izy
But no, you are wrong.	fa tsia diso ianao
No, two out of three.	tsia roa aminny telo
It had to stop.	tsy maintsy nijanona izany
Yes, it is near.	eny fa efa akaiky izany
I don't see him much.	tsy hitako loatra izy
He didn't have a problem with that either.	tsy nanana olana taminizany koa izy
I hope you never get lost.	manantena aho fa tsy ho very mihitsy ianao
They really won’t do anything.	tena tsy hanao na inona na inona izy ireo
I still don't see you.	mbola tsy mahita anao aho
It was meant to have special meaning.	natao ho misy dikany manokana izany
It's a little too close.	somary akaiky loatra izany
And that's how it should be.	ary izany no tokony ho izany
This is very clear to me.	mazava tanteraka izany amiko
It should be the first thing.	tokony ho ny zavatra voalohany
But no, that’s not enough.	saingy tsia tsy ampy izany
But not money.	fa tsy vola
From now on, you know it all.	manomboka aminizao fotoana izao dia fantatrao daholo
We have yes.	manana eny izahay
Same as now.	mitovy aminny ankehitriny
He has to be here, here absolutely.	tsy maintsy eto izy eto tanteraka
It’s always about me.	momba ahy foana izany
He doesn't know why now.	tsy fantany ny antony izao
There is no discussion.	tsy misy resaka
It can still be seen working there today.	hita mbola miasa any izy io ankehitriny
He had to say something, and quickly.	tsy maintsy nilaza zavatra izy ary haingana
That is a fact.	izany dia zavamisy
Or because it’s hard.	na satria sarotra
Both are different.	samy tsy mitovy
But you did nothing wrong.	tsy nanao ratsy anefa ianao
I will be here.	ho eto aho
This can be seen in two ways.	mety ho hita aminny fomba roa izany
But there was action.	nisy hetsika anefa teo
But you really don’t, you know.	fa tena tsy manao izany ianao fantatrao
But in fact, it doesn’t work.	saingy raha ny marina dia tsy mandeha izany
More than enough.	mihoatra noho ny mety
He seemed familiar, as before.	toa mahazatra azy toy ny taloha
It seems like it’s impossible.	toy ny hoe tsy azo atao izany
I just found out.	vao fantatro izany
I had to act fast.	tsy maintsy nanao zavatra haingana aho
It’s easy now.	mora izany ankehitriny
It wasn't much money then.	tsy dia be loatra ny vola taminizany
And the best part.	ary ny tsara indrindra
No, the other one.	tsia ilay iray
And all of these things are absolutely certain.	ary ireo zavatra rehetra ireo dia azo antoka tanteraka
I have gone too far now.	lasa lavitra loatra aho izao
Here, every woman will be different.	eto ny vehivavy tsirairay dia ho samy hafa
He just needs a little more.	mbola mila kely fotsiny izy
She will be happier there, with people like her.	ho faly kokoa izy any miaraka aminny olona toa azy
You need me.	ianao no mila ahy
You have a talkative man.	manana lehilahy be resaka ianao
He didn’t know what exactly it was.	tsy fantany hoe inona marina izany
That alone will be enough.	izany fotsiny dia ho ampy
No, it's gone.	tsia lasa izany
Sometimes it is necessary, but not necessary.	indraindray mila izany fa tsy ilaina
There was good news and good news.	nisy vaovao tsara sy vaovao tsara
He needed a job.	nila asa izy
I could have had more.	mety ho nanana bebe kokoa aho
It’s all you.	ianao daholo izany
That's enough for me.	ampy ho ahy izany
And we can’t have that.	ary tsy afaka manana izany isika
Yes, you like these things.	eny tianao ireo zavatra ireo
Sometimes it is not.	indraindray tsy izany no izy
History is no more.	tsy misy intsony ny tantara
Both were found to be inaccurate.	samy hita fa tsy mety
Things are going to be very bad.	ho ratsy be ny zavatra
I really do, about a lot of things.	tena manao izany aho momba ny zavatra maro
But this is true, albeit in part.	marina anefa izany na dia ampahany ihany aza
It might be a good place to.	mety ho toerana tsara ho anny
You are the same, or different.	mitovy ianao na tsy mitovy
You need everyone.	mila ny tsirairay ianao
And not in a good way.	ary tsy aminny fomba tsara
The old, very old.	ilay taloha tena taloha
He did that sometimes.	nanao izany izy indraindray
This path does not work.	tsy mandeha io lalana io
We need too much.	mila zavatra be loatra isika
But he’s on to one thing.	saingy eo aminny zavatra iray izy
That’s a better word.	teny tsara kokoa izany
It’s a place.	toerana izy io
But you seem confused.	saingy toa very hevitra ianao
As is appropriate for many people.	toy ny mety ho anny olona maro
Works but not perfect.	miasa fa tsy tanteraka
Or sometimes for no reason at all.	na indraindray tsy misy antony mihitsy
He is not dead yet.	mbola tsy maty indray izy
So it might be the best.	noho izany dia mety ho ny tsara indrindra
But it will not happen.	saingy tsy ho tanteraka izany
I found them beautiful.	hitako fa tsara tarehy izy ireo
The results were really nice.	nahafinaritra tokoa ny vokatra
But I think we have time.	heveriko anefa fa manana fotoana isika
No, it's very different.	tsia tena hafa mihitsy ilay izy
But they are completely different.	saingy samy hafa tanteraka izy ireo
But we are close.	fa efa akaiky izahay
Some find it very good there as well.	misy mahita tena tsara any koa
But we were wrong, very wrong.	diso anefa izahay tena diso
He didn't get it either.	tsy nahazo koa izy
Sure, that is.	azo antoka izany hoe
Already doing everything.	efa manao ny zavadrehetra
Everyone has a choice.	samy manana safidy
Sometimes it just doesn’t seem to exist.	indraindray dia toa tsy misy
There you are.	eo no misy anao
It’s all for me.	ho ahy daholo izany
However, the word goes.	na izany aza dia mandeha io teny io
Not when he’s close.	tsy rehefa akaiky izy
But it does make sense.	misy dikany ihany anefa izany
It becomes very difficult.	lasa sarotra be izany
They just work better.	miasa tsara kokoa fotsiny izy ireo
There seems to be a problem before.	toa nisy olana teo aloha
You need to do them all.	mila manao azy rehetra ianao
I knew he wouldn't do it.	fantatro fa tsy hanao izany izy
They are new.	vaovao izy ireo
It also started at the bottom.	nanomboka teo ambany koa izany
it is for me.	ho ahy izy
Good looking job.	asa tsara mijery
It should have looked earlier.	tokony ho nijery tany aloha
These are my favorites.	ireo no tena tiako indrindra
So much more than any other game.	be lavitra noho ny lalao hafa
But we got nothing else.	tsy nahazo zavatra hafa anefa izahay
There is no better result.	tsy misy vokatra tsara kokoa
He did not do those things.	tsy nanao ireo zavatra ireo izy
But now they are doing well.	mandeha tsara anefa izy ireo izao
Yes, he did something for her.	eny nanao zavatra ho azy izy
It was also new to him.	vaovao taminy koa izany
Without you, without me.	raha tsy misy ianao dia tsy misy ahy
They started where they were.	nanomboka teo aminny toerana misy azy ireo izy ireo
And that is exactly what it is.	ary izany tokoa no izy
There may still be time.	mety mbola hisy ny fotoana
Maybe it did a little.	angamba nanao kely izany
That’s the way, of course.	izany no lalana mazava ho azy
Which is kind of fun.	izay somary mahafinaritra
Yes, there was a little fight.	eny nisy ady kely
But in fact it was worth it.	saingy raha ny marina dia mendrika izany
He was very happy there.	faly be izy teo
From the photo.	avy aminny sary
It will be a good day.	ho tsara io andro io
However, it could be worse.	na izany aza mety ho ratsy kokoa izany
They were really fun.	tena nahafinaritra azy ireo
And that’s the only time.	ary io ihany no fotoana
However, not at that time.	na izany aza tsy taminizany fotoana izany
But that is not the real reason.	tsy izany anefa no tena antony
It is clear to me now.	efa mazava amiko izao
It should be clearly visible.	tokony ho hita mazava tsara izany
That's a nice word.	teny mahafinaritra izany
Like the picture.	toy ny sary
Very badly done.	tena ratsy natao
But they do it fast.	saingy manao izany haingana izy ireo
He knew he had to do it.	fantany fa tokony hanao izany izy
But they all did very well.	tena nanao tsara anefa izy rehetra
You can find it for yourself.	afaka mahita izany ho anao ianao
There are too many of us.	betsaka loatra isika
New, ladies.	vaovao vehivavy
In fact, it has to.	raha ny marina dia tsy maintsy
In fact, it is very necessary.	raha ny marina dia tena ilaina izany
There is nothing necessary in life.	tsy misy na inona na inona ilaina aminny fiainana
I always see it in the end.	hitako foana izany aminny farany
I used to think like you.	nieritreritra toa anao aho taloha
Lots of people here.	betsaka ny olona eto
Yes, and many more.	eny ary mbola maro kokoa
I just think there is more to life than that.	heveriko fotsiny fa misy mihoatra noho izany ny fiainana
And it goes faster than any car.	ary mandeha haingana kokoa noho ny fiara rehetra
This is generally for two reasons.	izany dia ankapobeny noho ny antony roa
Indeed, he was wrong.	eny tokoa diso lalana izy
Maybe not, but maybe.	angamba tsy izany fa angamba
But that may not be possible.	mety tsy ho tanteraka anefa izany
Everything was really fun.	tena nahafinaritra ny zavadrehetra
If any good.	raha misy tsara
He alone gets it.	izy ihany no mahazo izany
But that may not be the case.	mety tsy ho toy izany anefa ny zavamisy
He just isn’t.	izy ihany no tsy
We have never seen anything like it.	samy tsy nahita zavatra toy izany mihitsy izahay
I know it doesn’t matter to you from me.	fantatro fa tsy misy dikany aminao izany avy amiko
Not for today.	tsy ho anny anio
However, they are good questions.	na izany aza fanontaniana tsara izy ireo
And not, of course.	ary tsy izany mazava ho azy
Anyway, enough about me.	na izany na tsy izany ampy ny momba ahy
Money didn’t matter.	tsy nisy dikany ny vola
No one is going to be so stupid.	tsy misy olona ho adala toy izany
That’s also what I really want to do.	izany koa no tena tiako atao
It was nice to see them all again.	nahafinaritra ny nahita azy rehetra indray
Glad to see the end.	faly mahita ny farany
I didn’t do anything with the pictures.	tsy nanao na inona na inona taminny sary aho
However, there are also problems.	na izany aza misy olana ihany koa
There is nothing about a typical day.	tsy misy na inona na inona momba ny andro mahazatra
The old ways have become new.	lasa vaovao ny lalana taloha
But a big step.	dingana lehibe anefa
Yes, we must do our best.	eny tsy maintsy manao ny tsara indrindra isika
They are no longer new.	tsy vaovao intsony izy ireo
I think everyone has their own.	heveriko fa samy manana ny azy ny tsirairay
And then there were three.	ary avy eo dia nisy telo
To him, he was confused.	ho azy dia very hevitra izy
But they said.	fa hoy izy ireo
Because we are.	satria isika
He doesn't like history.	tsy tia tantara izy
Nothing seems to work for me.	toa tsy misy miasa amiko
And so it is all.	ary toy izany daholo izany
Others go without anything.	ny hafa mandeha tsy misy na inona na inona
Here and now he needed her.	eto ary ankehitriny dia izy no nila azy
This was not possible before.	tsy azo atao izany teo aloha
But there was always the next year.	nisy foana anefa ny taona manaraka
There is more of course.	misy bebe kokoa mazava ho azy
He knows that way.	fantany io lalana io
So no information is needed.	noho izany dia tsy ilaina ny vaovao
This game is great.	lehibe ity lalao ity
I think he’s a great guy.	heveriko fa olona lehibe izy
Otherwise, no.	raha tsy izany dia tsia
He knew the bad about me.	fantany ny ratsy momba ahy
There is no room for two.	tsy misy toerana ho anny roa
He can get a lot then, he said.	afaka mahazo betsaka izy avy eo hoy izy
Because, in fact, there is no ordinary time.	satria raha ny marina tsy misy fotoana mahazatra
And it has to be.	ary tsy maintsy ho izy
They are better.	tsara kokoa izy ireo
It’s all good work.	asa tsara daholo izany
Everything is different.	samy hafa ny zavadrehetra
They stopped immediately.	nijanona avy hatrany izy ireo
He has to make a life for himself, somewhere.	tsy maintsy manao fiainana ho anny tenany izy any ho any
But not immediately.	fa tsy avy hatrany
It’s not that they’re really gone.	tsy hoe tena lasa izy ireo
It may be necessary.	mety ilaina izany
And mine seems fun.	ary ny ahy toa mahafinaritra
Soon we will be alone.	tsy ho ela dia irery isika
But he knew the truth.	fantany anefa ny tena zavamisy
Do this in two parts.	ataovy aminny ampahany roa izany
You can’t do everything.	tsy afaka manao ny zavadrehetra ianao
You and money.	ianao sy ny vola
They will get there.	ho tonga any izy ireo
They could all be hers.	mety ho azy daholo ireo
But this is not a normal day.	tsy andro mahazatra anefa izao
It will be new.	ho vaovao izany
But you already know that.	saingy efa fantatrao izany
Yes, not always.	eny tsy foana mihitsy
You should do next.	tokony hanao manaraka ianao
I almost did the same.	saika nanao izany koa aho
But he knew where he was.	fantany anefa izay nisy azy
But that soon stopped.	tsy ela anefa dia nijanona izany
That's the man.	izay ilay lehilahy
But yours is beautiful.	fa tsara tarehy ny anao
He will have to lose a lot.	tsy maintsy ho very be izy
It has never been so difficult before.	tsy mbola sarotra toy izao izany teo aloha
In the best variety as well.	aminny karazana tsara indrindra ihany koa
Others had similar ideas.	ny hafa dia nanana hevitra mitovy
It was part of him.	ampahany taminy izany
And that’s the real job.	ary izany no tena asa
But we’re not sure about the options.	saingy tsy manana antoka momba ny safidy isika
You must still have a great day.	tsy maintsy mbola manana andro mahafinaritra ianao
Anything but nothing.	na inona na inona fa tsy misy
He was always fun.	nahafinaritra foana izy
I’ve done all this before.	efa nanao izany rehetra izany aho taloha
If you will, you will.	raha ho ianao dia ho ho
When we get there.	rehefa tonga any izahay
He starts walking.	manomboka mandeha izy
You are not alone.	tsy ianao irery akory
It was like a new world.	toy ny tontolo vaovao ilay izy
Good timing, but not really.	fotoana tsara fa tsy tena
For men, too.	ho anny lehilahy koa aminizany

He seems to be a very decent man.	toa lehilahy mendrika tokoa izy
It's a moving car.	fiara mandeha izy io

I’m over walking.	mihoatra ny mandeha aho
Then he saw it no more.	dia tsy nahita izany intsony izy
Of course, this is not always easy.	mazava ho azy fa tsy mora foana izany
This is very important to them.	tena zavadehibe ho azy ireo izany

But, but.	saingy saingy

Absolutely not true.	tena tsy marina
Whether you like it or not.	na tia ianao na tsy tia
Apparently no one died.	toa tsy nisy maty

It was a really fun time.	tena fotoana nahafinaritra tokoa izany
There seemed to be no end to time.	toa tsy nisy farany ny fotoana
Enough of us up there.	ampy izay isika any ambony
It started two years ago.	nanomboka roa taona lasa izay izy
I think that’s a good thing, overall.	heveriko fa zavatra tsara izany aminny ankapobeny
Or even work.	na miasa mihitsy
But just kind of.	fa karazana ihany

There is no wrong reason for them.	tsy misy antony tsy mety ho azy ireo

It is still a very first day.	mbola andro voalohany be izao
This is a story about money.	ity dia tantara momba ny vola
This option seems to work well for some women.	ity safidy ity dia toa miasa tsara aminny vehivavy sasany
We can still do that.	mbola afaka manao izany isika
As he knew.	araka ny fantany
Yes, we did all that.	eny nanao izany rehetra izany izahay
There was bad news.	nisy vaovao ratsy tao
People seem to.	ny olona toa
No thanks at all.	tsy misaotra mihitsy
You have the choice.	manana ny safidy ianao
Probably a lot.	betsaka angamba
I think that’s normal.	heveriko fa mahazatra izany
It’s not bad, it’s just not good.	tsy ratsy izany tsy tsara fotsiny
Probably this year.	mety aminity taona ity
Works as before.	miasa toy ny teo aloha
I know too much about him.	be loatra ny zavatra fantatro momba azy
It was always there.	teo foana izy io
All ideas.	ny hevitra rehetra

They’re all fun.	izy rehetra dia mahafinaritra
Not true in part, but true in general.	tsy marina aminny ampahany fa marina aminny ankapobeny
But, he didn’t need it.	saingy tsy nila izany izy
We were definitely in the right place.	azo antoka fa teo aminny toerana mety izahay
I’m so glad you like it !.	tena faly aho fa tianao izany
Now, we do the same.	ankehitriny manao toy izany koa isika
She likes that idea.	tiany io hevitra io
Of course, this is not something of the world.	mazava ho azy fa tsy zavatra avy aminizao tontolo izao izany
It was a bad idea at a bad time.	hevitra ratsy izany taminny fotoana ratsy
It is also a difficult question.	fanontaniana sarotra ihany koa izany
The fact is he is right.	ny zavamisy dia marina izy
And for other reasons as well.	ary noho ny antony hafa koa
They’re not very pretty, not really.	tsy dia tsara tarehy izy ireo tsy tena
And of course they are true.	ary mazava ho azy fa marina ireo
But nothing more could be done.	tsy nisy azo natao intsony anefa
He didn’t, you know.	tsy nanao izany izy fantatrao
No one has ever seen anything like it.	tsy mbola nisy olona nahita zavatra toy izany
There are so many, many new ideas.	be dia be ny hevitra vaovao be dia be
Not enough there, not yet.	tsy ampy ny teo tsy mbola
Certainly not.	azo antoka fa tsy izany
Life is too hard for that.	sarotra loatra ny fiainana aminizany
Make the idea seem new.	ataovy toy ny hoe vaovao ilay hevitra
But you have to watch.	mila mijery anefa ianao
Not so good news.	vaovao tsy dia mahafinaritra

Nothing special but just fun though.	tsy misy zavatra manokana fa mahafinaritra ihany na izany aza
They should be faceless.	tokony ho tsy misy tarehy izy ireo
But we have to go.	tsy maintsy mandeha anefa isika
The war will be bad.	ho ratsy ny ady
I usually have a good time here.	matetika aho no manana fotoana mahafinaritra eto
I think that’s really good.	heveriko fa tena tsara izany
But that’s another story for another day.	saingy tantara hafa izany ho anny andro hafa
It can’t be done either stupid or both.	tsy azo atao izany na adala na izy roa
No problem tonight.	tsy misy olana anio alina
He has to get it one way or another.	tsy maintsy mahazo izany izy aminny fomba iray na aminny fomba hafa
Next, in fact, it must be the same.	manaraka izany raha ny marina dia tsy maintsy mitovy aminny
But look! ' 	fa jereo
Something very simple.	zavatra tsotra tokoa
It’s almost always hard for me.	saika sarotra amiko foana izany
I know a little bit.	somary fantatro ihany
Maybe that’s great.	lehibe angamba izany
Three is enough.	telo dia ampy
You lose everything.	very ny zavadrehetra ianao
They don't really see you.	tsy tena mahita anao akory izy ireo
That must be true.	tsy maintsy marina izany
The car started moving.	nanomboka nandeha ilay fiara
But two is usually enough.	ampy anefa ny roa matetika
No, different.	tsia hafa
He got it first.	nahazo voalohany izy
There are many ways to do this.	misy fomba maro azo atao aminizany
Now he could do something very important.	ankehitriny dia afaka nanao zavatra tena ilaina izy
It was really fun too.	tena nahafinaritra koa
Stayed there for three days.	nijanona telo andro teo
She liked the picture.	tiany ilay sary
Little did he know it was there in the first place.	tsy fantany fa teo izy io taminny voalohany
Easy to get, fast and very useful.	mora azo haingana ary tena ilaina
They all die easily and they all die stupid.	maty mora daholo izy ireo ary maty adala daholo
Then another, then another.	dia hafa avy eo hafa
It can’t be too fast.	tsy mety ho haingana loatra izany
He looks up.	mijery ambony izy
Men expect nothing.	tsy manantena na inona na inona ny lehilahy
But when you are with these people.	ianao anefa rehefa miaraka aminireo olona ireo
It’s a classic story.	tantara mahazatra izy io
Certainly not all.	azo antoka fa tsy ho toy izany daholo izany
I never told him.	tsy nilaza taminy mihitsy aho
He may be wrong.	mety diso izy
Well, he thought.	tsara hoy izy nieritreritra
Things can be anything, really.	ny zavatra dia mety ho na inona na inona tena
I really like them, a lot.	tena tiako izy ireo be dia be
Whatever the type.	na inona na inona karazana
That’s how it all started.	izany no nanomboka ny zavadrehetra
He didn’t like the idea very much.	tsy tiany loatra ilay hevitra
And maybe there was.	ary angamba nisy taminizany
He was the only one who did it.	izy irery ihany no nanao izany
He is very busy, so he doesn't come often.	be atao izy ka tsy tonga matetika
Not now or not.	tsy izao na tsia
Yes, a little easy.	eny somary mora
There is also the possibility of work.	misy ihany koa ny mety ho asa
But he doesn’t mean anything to me.	tsy misy dikany amiko anefa izy
I hope life went well for him.	manantena aho fa nandeha tsara ho azy ny fiainana
He could tell the truth.	afaka nilaza ny marina izy
Not in this life.	tsy aminity fiainana ity
He’s bigger, even bigger.	lehibe izy mbola lehibe kokoa
I know that's not right.	fantatro fa tsy mety izany
But you know they are options.	saingy fantatrao fa safidy izy ireo
Because it’s important, it’s really important.	satria zavadehibe izany zavadehibe tokoa izany
And the car is the place to be.	ary ny fiara no toerana tokony hisy
It was a true story.	tantara marina ilay izy
No amount is too small or too big.	tsy misy vola kely loatra na lehibe loatra
It shouldn’t be either.	tsy tokony ho izy koa
They were too big for me.	lehibe loatra tamiko izy ireo
It doesn’t seem to happen.	toa tsy hisy izany
I've done that too.	efa nanao anio koa aho
It also works well.	mandeha tsara koa izy io
And it should be.	ary tokony ho
He knew there would have to be the next night.	fantany fa tsy maintsy hisy ny alina manaraka
He will come, if he can.	ho tonga izy raha afaka
Of course, this is not a bad thing.	mazava ho azy fa tsy zavatra ratsy loatra izany
But there were good times.	nisy fotoana tsara anefa
Not only this.	tsy izao ihany
He was one of the newcomers to her.	izy no iray aminireo vaovao taminy
But it works.	dia mandeha anefa izany
And it’s like everything else.	ary toy ny zavatra hafa rehetra izany
He knew something was coming to him.	fantany fa hisy zavatra ho avy aminy
However, the new method is more accurate.	na izany aza ny fomba vaovao dia marina kokoa
We have to look at the facts carefully.	tsy maintsy mijery tsara ny zavamisy isika
It's all different now.	hafa daholo izao
A lot of women have it.	betsaka ny vehivavy manana izany
Then there is that story.	dia misy izany tantara izany
I am only a man.	lehilahy ihany aho
It doesn’t really matter to him.	tsy dia zavadehibe aminy izany
But the most important thing is timing.	fa ny tena zavadehibe dia ny fotoana
But not this one woman.	tsy ity vehivavy iray ity anefa
You can now do whatever other work you want.	afaka manao izay asa hafa tianao ianao izao
So I was lost.	noho izany dia very aho
The end has finally come.	tonga ihany ny farany
But maybe not the others.	saingy mety tsy ny hafa
But they are free.	afaka anefa izy ireo
And neither is it.	ary tsy izany koa
They were just below.	teo ambany ihany izy ireo
Didn't think of anything.	tsy nieritreritra na inona na inona
I'm still here.	mbola eto aho
Because even if he didn’t, he did.	satria na dia tsy nanao izany aza izy dia nanao izany
It could be something like that.	mety ho zavatra toy izany
There is nothing wrong with that.	tsy misy ratsy any
Or some other kind of false work.	na karazana asa tsy marina hafa
We can't.	tsy afaka izahay
No world, no history.	tsy misy izao tontolo izao tsy misy tantara
There may even be two other people.	mety hisy olona roa hafa koa aza
He had to be there.	tsy maintsy nisy izy
Two cars arrived.	nisy fiara roa tonga
So that's very true.	ka tena marina izany
We took a short trip.	nanao dia kely izahay
We hope you are as happy as we are !.	manantena izahay fa faly toa anay ianao
Maybe they really are.	angamba tena izy ireo
Whether it was there or there.	na teo izy io na teo
Of course, this result is not guaranteed.	mazava ho azy fa tsy azo antoka izany vokatra izany
He looked around.	nijery ny manodidina izy
I was so fast.	haingana toy izany aho
The same goes for news.	toy izany koa ny vaovao
I looked down.	nijery ambany aho
I didn’t think anything about it, you know.	tsy nieritreritra na inona na inona momba izany aho fantatrao
And now the news.	ary izao ny vaovao
Always, but wrong.	foana fa diso
But he did not stop there.	tsy nijanona teo anefa izy
He didn't need the money.	tsy nila ny vola izy
Too much to go on.	be loatra ny mandeha
It’s so simple and fun to do.	tena tsotra sy mahafinaritra ny manao azy
Yes, the story is the same.	eny mitovy ny tantara
Glad you could be there.	faly ianao fa afaka ho any
For some reason, these choices are always ours.	noho ny antony sasany dia antsika foana ireo safidy ireo
Of course, that makes sense.	mazava ho azy fa misy dikany izany
We are all enjoying the moment.	mahafinaritra antsika rehetra izao fotoana izao
In fact, it’s just hard, time.	raha ny marina sarotra fotsiny izy fotoana
You will love him, and he will love you.	ho tia azy ianao ary ho tia anao izy
But maybe he is.	fa angamba izy ihany
So it won’t be a problem.	ka tsy ho olana izany
He has never done that to me before.	mbola tsy nanao toy izany tamiko izy
The one there.	ilay teo
Everyone loves you.	tia anao ny rehetra
To people who can’t have.	aminny olona tsy afaka manana
It will be the same.	ho toy izany koa izany
It was full of people.	feno olona tanteraka tao
The old way of life.	ny fomba fiainana taloha
See the picture above on the trail.	jereo ny sary ambony aminny lalana
I even enjoyed it.	nahafinaritra ahy mihitsy aza
You can’t just be a woman.	tsy afaka manao vehivavy fotsiny ianao
Because you need me.	satria mila ahy ianao
The here is here.	ny eto dia eto
You had to think hard about it.	tsy maintsy nieritreritra mafy momba izany ianao
Not everyone is the same.	tsy mitovy ny rehetra
It’s not as fun as words.	tsy mahafinaritra toy ny teny
A person who is not very strong.	olona tsy dia mafy loatra
We don't need anything else.	tsy mila zavatra hafa intsony isika
You like it.	tianao izany
In fact, we look forward to you.	raha ny marina manantena anao izahay
The real man.	ilay lehilahy tena misy azy
And I enjoy it.	ary mahafinaritra ahy izany
He never deserves it.	tsy mendrika izany mihitsy izy
It certainly will.	azo antoka fa hanao izany
Maybe it’s you.	angamba ianao izany
That’s not where it starts.	tsy eo no manomboka
We came here to work.	tonga eto izahay hanao asa
Nothing too bad.	tsy misy zavatra ratsy loatra
Every word is.	ny teny rehetra dia
They seem easy.	toa mora izy ireo
There are more now.	misy bebe kokoa ankehitriny
Even completely happy.	na faly tanteraka mihitsy aza
They just came for me.	tonga ho ahy ihany izy ireo
However, it doesn’t seem to work.	na izany aza toa tsy mandeha izany
It almost just became fun.	saika lasa mahafinaritra fotsiny
The news is meaningless.	ny vaovao dia tsy misy dikany
There is other work.	misy asa hafa
Not everyone can do that.	tsy ny rehetra no afaka manao izany
No, they are not all the same.	tsia tsy mitovy izy rehetra
And we have been.	ary efa nisy izahay
The food is good and the conversation is better.	tsara ny sakafo ary tsara kokoa ny resaka
You are all that matters.	ianao no zavadehibe rehetra

They will do it.	izy ireo no hanao izany
This is more difficult than it first appears.	sarotra kokoa noho ny hita aminny voalohany izany
The method is simple.	ny fomba dia tsotra

It’s like he’s different.	toy ny hoe hafa karazana izy
Very happy to be there.	faly be fa tonga tany
There was a good idea.	nisy hevitra tsara
They could now go.	afaka nandeha izy ireo izao
It will come to him.	ho tonga aminy izany
This is all good news.	vaovao mahafinaritra daholo izany
They only have to be right once.	indray mandeha ihany izy ireo no tokony ho marina
And each move is a little different.	ary ny hetsika tsirairay dia hafa kely
It seems to them.	toa azy ireo izany
And that alone is true.	ary io ihany no marina
It's not like that.	tsy toy izao izany
One, of course, is timing.	ny iray mazava ho azy dia ny fotoana
Something difficult.	zavatra sarotra
And finally, they say yes.	ary farany hoy izy ireo eny
That's what you know.	izay no fantatrao
This man did.	nanao io lehilahy io
Everything is not personal.	ny zavadrehetra dia tsy ho anny tena manokana
But you have a better choice.	saingy manana safidy tsara kokoa ianao
He seems to be too high himself.	toa ambony loatra ny tenany
If so.	raha izany
They love you as much as you do.	tia anao toa anao izy ireo
Only one person can have anything.	olona iray ihany no afaka manana na inona na inona
Although.	na dia eo aza
I know you get it.	fantatro fa azonao
He really seemed to like it.	toa tiany tokoa izany
We will come with him.	ho avy eo miaraka aminy izahay
Not one of the easier ones.	tsy iray aminireo mora kokoa
This is normal.	izany no mahazatra
He was now thinking hard.	nieritreritra mafy izy izao
Maybe not at all.	angamba tsy ho izany mihitsy
I looked around me.	nijery ny manodidina ahy aho
But that is not the case.	saingy tsy izany no zavamisy
That option is still available.	mbola misy izany safidy izany
He never needed a car.	tsy nila fiara mihitsy izy
There was nothing, he said.	tsy nisy na inona na inona hoy izy
He will do anything for her.	hanao na inona na inona ho azy izy
There was no definite reason.	tsy nisy antony azo antoka
Mine and mine only.	ny ahy ary ny ahy ihany
At the right time, of course.	aminny fotoana mety mazava ho azy
The woman looked at him again.	nijery azy indray ilay vehivavy
He really needs a place.	tena mila toerana izy
It will be very special.	ho tena manokana izany
But it’s true about the house.	saingy marina ny momba ny trano
We need everything.	mila izao rehetra izao isika
Either he walks or you walk.	na mandeha izy na mandeha ianao
Some will be faster than others.	ny sasany dia ho haingana kokoa noho ny hafa
Ideas are ideas.	ny hevitra dia hevitra
He had already looked at her.	efa nijery azy izy
The problem only started in three stages.	nanomboka taminny dingana telo ihany ny olana
Like, big big.	toy ny lehibe lehibe
Well, it goes well.	eny ary mandeha tsara
Hope you like it !.	manantena fa ho tianao
However, there will always be something missing.	na izany aza dia hisy zavatra tsy ampy foana
I think you are one.	heveriko fa iray ianao
He has a decent life.	manana fiainana mendrika izy
He had an easy time there.	nahazo fotoana mora tao izy
If not, it’s mine.	raha tsy izany dia ahy izy
He was the wrong man for me.	izy no lehilahy tsy mety amiko
Really, finally, it’s all on him now.	tena farany eo aminy daholo izao
There seems to be something wrong with him.	toa misy zavatra tsy mety aminy
These things should go by itself.	ireo zavatra ireo dia tokony ho mandeha ho azy
Especially this year and next.	indrindra aminity taona ity sy aminny manaraka
Or maybe just one.	na mety iray ihany
They look the same at first.	toa mitovy aminny voalohany izy ireo
He works no matter what.	miasa na inona na inona izy
He didn't like to think about it.	tsy tiany ny nieritreritra izany
For me personally this is a matter.	amiko manokana ity resaka ity
So they expect a war.	koa manantena ady izy ireo
You are not alone either.	tsy irery koa ianao
Only other steps are important.	dingana hafa ihany no zavadehibe
But even so.	fa na dia izany aza
They can do whatever they want, of course.	afaka manao izay tiany izy ireo mazava ho azy
And they really did exist.	ary tena nisy tokoa izy ireo
If that’s true, that’s good news.	raha marina izany dia vaovao tsara izany
I might even have something for you.	mety manana zavatra ho anao mihitsy aza aho
Such money can be huge in the end, because.	ny vola toy izany dia mety ho lehibe aminny farany noho ny
I don't see any choice.	tsy hitako izay safidy
Then they went to the picture.	dia nandeha tany aminny sary izy ireo
He can't come fast.	tsy afaka tonga haingana izy
There is still one today.	mbola misy iray ankehitriny
They are not wrong.	tsy diso izy ireo
A familiar movement.	hetsika efa mahazatra
No, all of them.	tsia izy rehetra
The end result is the same.	ny vokatra farany dia mitovy
The interior is complete and accurate.	ny anatiny dia feno sy marina
The fact is, it doesn’t make sense.	ny tena zavamisy dia tsy misy dikany izany
Not an unusual story, really.	tsy tantara tsy mahazatra tena
Only some of them are true.	ny sasany aminizy ireo ihany no marina
One in which everything is always good.	iray izay tsara foana ny zavadrehetra
I never did anything like that again.	tsy nanao zavatra toy izany intsony aho
But it has to be more than that.	tsy maintsy mihoatra noho izany anefa izany
Of course, this is completely absurd.	mazava ho azy fa tena tsy misy dikany izany
I want to be.	tiako ny ho
Of course, that seems normal.	mazava ho azy fa toa mahazatra
The surroundings are right.	marina ny manodidina
With these methods.	miaraka aminireo fomba ireo
I work the same.	miasa mitovy aho
They have no jobs.	tsy manana asa izy ireo
The last thing in the past.	ny zavatra farany aminny lasa
You are here.	eto ianao
We may be wrong.	mety diso isika
As it was, but not.	toy ny nisy fa tsy
One day or another.	indray andro na hafa
The story was already there.	efa teo ny tantara
They are doing a good job.	manao ny asa tsara ireo
He didn't look like that.	tsy nijery toy izany izy
Because he is not.	satria tsy izy
You are right about that.	marina ny anao momba izany
I think that was true of me.	heveriko fa marina izany tamiko
It’s always something.	zavatra foana izany
But he seemed to do it.	saingy toa nanao izany izy
They don’t need anything.	tsy mila na inona na inona izy ireo
I have never seen him so happy.	mbola tsy nahita azy faly toy izany aho
That’s another word about war.	teny hafa momba ny ady izany
In the real world, this idea is not very true.	aminny tontolo tena izy tsy dia marina loatra io hevitra io
It may be less than that, too.	mety ho kely noho izany koa
Which yes, it could be.	izay eny mety ho izany

That’s a good reason.	antony tsara izany

But there is not much of a problem.	tsy misy olana loatra anefa

In that case, there was no place for myself.	aminizany dia tsy nisy toerana ho anny tena ahy

Up to them.	hatrany aminizy ireo
We weren’t both sure about that.	samy tsy nahazo antoka ny aminizany izahay
This last option is for him.	ity safidy farany ity dia ho azy
He is full.	feno izy
Finally he got an idea.	farany dia nahazo hevitra izy
He always went first.	izy foana no nandeha voalohany
The car is full of people.	feno olona ny fiara
They may all be the same age.	mety mitovy taona daholo izy ireo
That stuff will suffice.	ho ampy izany zavatra izany
All the women in it.	ny vehivavy rehetra teo aminy
You will be better than that.	ho tsara kokoa noho izany ianao
Not even money.	tsy vola akory
They are very close now.	tena akaiky izy ireo ankehitriny
We thought a lot about it.	nieritreritra be izahay momba izany
They are wrong.	diso izy ireo
They are yours.	anao izy ireo
The fact is that things always exist.	ny zavamisy dia hoe misy foana ny zavatra
However, he had a good idea.	na izany aza dia nanana hevitra tsara izy
I enjoyed these.	nahafinaritra ahy ireo
And it made sense.	ary nisy dikany izany
The conversation began.	nanomboka ny resaka
They said it was kind of a new top.	nilaza izy ireo fa karazana ambony vaovao ilay izy
Of course you can.	mazava ho azy fa afaka ihany
Not a small house.	tsy trano kely iray
However, in general this is not the case.	na izany aza aminny ankapobeny dia tsy izany no zavamisy
Very good idea.	hevitra tena tsara
And that is certainly true today.	ary azo antoka fa mbola marina izany ankehitriny
There is always the next.	misy foana ny manaraka
It's been a long time.	efa ela no lasa
There are many of them, it seems.	misy maro aminizy ireo toa
Because they all do.	satria izy rehetra manao izany
He just came to work.	tonga miasa fotsiny izy
I love them right away.	tiako izy ireo avy hatrany
Then the real battle began.	dia nanomboka ny tena ady
Which could be any time, of course.	izay mety ho fotoana rehetra mazava ho azy
People finally start from this place.	manomboka aminity toerana ity ny olona aminny farany
However, it doesn’t go into trouble here.	na izany aza tsy mandeha aminny olana eto
People in the neighborhood at the time.	ny olona teo aminny manodidina taminizany fotoana izany
All three have their pros and cons.	samy manana ny tsara sy ny ratsy izy telo ireo
It may be different.	mety ho hafa ilay izy
And they always go that way sometimes.	ary mandeha toy izany foana izy ireo indraindray
They are together.	miaraka izy ireo
All of this is true.	marina daholo izany rehetra izany
Everyone made a story.	samy nanao tantara ny tsirairay
I do the same.	manao izany koa aho
Location is a big part of any event.	ny toerana dia ampahany lehibe aminny hetsika rehetra
He does what he wants.	manao izay tiany izy
Three are incomplete.	telo no tsy feno
I was just starting to think this way.	vao nanomboka nieritreritra anio lalana io aho
It doesn’t matter to him.	tsy misy zavadehibe aminy
The resulting image will still be automatic.	mbola ho mandeha ho azy ny sary azo aminizany
It’s nice to see you beautiful.	mahafinaritra ny mahita anao tsara tarehy
You might know.	mety ho fantatrao
I know you need some.	fantatro fa mila sasany ianao
He saw nothing wrong with her.	tsy nahita na inona na inona ratsy taminy izy
In this case.	aminity resaka ity
It’s still a good idea.	mbola hevitra tsara izany
This is not the right time.	tsy fotoana mety izao
So it is with you.	toy izany koa ny aminao
The meanings are the same but not the same.	mitovy ny dikany fa tsy mitovy
He didn’t want to waste time.	tsy te ho very fotoana izy
But you already know these.	fa efa fantatrao ireo
You probably looked at them more than you did.	nijery azy ireo angamba mihoatra noho ianao
But in the end, it’s real.	saingy aminny farany dia tena izy io
But he did not know her well.	tsy fantany tsara anefa izy
Here it is kind of the same.	eto dia karazana mitovy
In fact, it really happened.	raha ny marina dia tena nisy izany
No, this time.	tsia ity indray
No, not good.	tsia tsy tsara
And now you have them and we need them.	ary ankehitriny manana azy ireo ianao ary mila azy ireo izahay
There were two ways.	nisy fomba roa
I could see he didn’t like it.	hitako fa tsy tiany ilay izy
I hope they work somewhere.	manantena aho fa miasa any ho any izy ireo
I saw them around.	nahita azy ireo manodidina aho
I don’t want that to be true.	tsy tiako ho marina izany
If it was easy, everyone would be there.	raha mora izany dia ho eo daholo ny rehetra
We have all been there.	efa nisy isika rehetra
Of course, there is no story in the news about it.	mazava ho azy fa tsy misy tantara aminny vaovao momba izany
They are malnourished, for a reason.	tsy ampy sakafo izy ireo noho ny antony iray
About all that.	momba izany rehetra izany
I think they are beautiful.	heveriko fa tsara tarehy izy ireo
So they should be free now.	noho izany dia tokony ho afaka aminizao fotoana izao izy ireo
And there was no place for them.	ary tsy nisy toerana ho azy ireo
You will love them.	ho tia azy ireo ianao
It’s just another product.	vokatra hafa fotsiny izany
It was not difficult to do so.	tsy sarotra ny nanao izany
I said he always does.	hoy aho hoe manao izany foana izy
There are better ones.	misy tsara kokoa
Two of his favorite things.	zavatra roa tiany indrindra
He was at an age you never knew.	teo aminny taona izay tsy fantatrao mihitsy izy
They are different things, of course.	zavatra samy hafa izy ireo mazava ho azy
He will do that in the future.	hanao izany izy aminny ho avy
But thanks for the kind words.	misaotra taminny teny mahafinaritra anefa
These people saw everything.	nahita ny zavadrehetra ireo olona ireo
i will love.	ho tia aho
But it also eventually found a home.	nahita trano ihany koa anefa izy io taminny farany
The fact is they have the money.	ny zavamisy dia manana ny vola izy ireo
Of course, no one is there.	mazava ho azy fa tsy misy olona ao
They don’t want to do that.	tsy te hanao izany izy ireo
Both of these reasons are wrong.	samy diso ireo antony ireo
Maybe new, maybe old love.	mety ho vaovao angamba tia taloha
We always do that.	manao izany foana izahay
Which isn’t too bad.	izay tsy dia ratsy
So in words.	ka aminny teny
He looked above all good.	nijery mihoatra noho ny tsara rehetra izy
Yes, no, thank you.	eny tsia misaotra
It’s a bad place for him.	toerana ratsy ho azy izany
However, he was not alone.	hita anefa fa tsy irery izy
Different and better.	hafa sy tsara kokoa
The first part is here.	ny ampahany voalohany dia eto
It can only be bad.	mety ho ratsy ihany
Just the right picture.	ny sary mety ihany
But they are not worthy.	tsy mendrika anefa izy ireo
I must be misplaced.	tsy maintsy ho diso toerana aho
So, you can go to many places.	noho izany afaka mandeha any aminny toerana maro ianao
It starts soon.	manomboka tsy ho ela izany
The past is still with him.	mbola ao aminy ny lasa
Not so for me.	tsy mba toy izany amiko
I think it’s worth it.	heveriko fa mendrika izany
Thanks to both of them.	misaotra azy roa
Or worse, therefore.	na ny ratsy indrindra noho izany
The people who work for us are dead.	maty ny olona miasa ho anay
The only really important thing.	ny zavatra tena zavadehibe ihany
This part is fun and easy.	ity ampahany ity dia mahafinaritra sy mora
You, of course, already got that many years ago.	ianao mazava ho azy efa nahazo izany taona maro lasa izay
For himself, as well as for her.	ho anny tenany ary koa ny azy
It's good for you too.	tsara ho anao koa izany
This is probably the lowest.	izany angamba no ambany indrindra
Each step of the process.	ny dingana tsirairay aminny dingana
There may or may not be.	mety hisy na tsy hisy
But this one was real.	tena nisy tokoa anefa ity iray ity
There was nothing he liked better.	tsy nisy zavatra tiany kokoa
And that’s a big problem.	ary tena olana be izany
It is not for us, but for us.	tsy ho antsika izy io fa ho antsika
This is a real problem.	tena olana izany
He’s good, he knows it.	tsara izy fantany izany
That place is always there.	eo foana io toerana io
Now, he said, could be a good time.	izao hoy izy dia mety ho fotoana tsara
In real life, both are gone.	aminny tena fiainana dia samy lasa izy roa
But thanks again.	fa misaotra indray
I will do great things.	hanao zavatra lehibe aho
The battle is very easy.	tena mora ny ady
Not by much, but big enough.	tsy aminny be fa ampy ho lehibe
To others, it seems clearer.	aminny hafa dia toa mazava kokoa izany
But we did not receive any money.	tsy nahazo vola anefa izahay
I really don’t see what works.	tena tsy hitako izay miasa
We don’t need anything else.	tsy mila zavatra hafa izahay
You will never come here again.	tsy ho tonga eto intsony ianao
So they had.	ka nanana izy ireo
He never thought of anything else.	tsy nieritreritra zavatra hafa mihitsy izy
He will do so even for no reason.	hanao izany izy na dia tsy misy antony aza
Maybe that sounds crazy.	toa adala angamba izany
I've seen it in people before.	efa hitako taminny olona izany taloha
There are only two possible locations.	roa ihany no toerana mety hisy azy
He didn't look at it.	tsy nijery izany izy
Everyone is coming soon.	ho avy tsy ho ela ny rehetra
But it is still needed.	mbola ilaina anefa izany
They did bad things.	nanao zavatra ratsy izy ireo
So now they are all the same.	ka aminizao fotoana izao dia samy mitovy
Don’t just do it.	aza manao izany fotsiny
Existing building.	trano misy aminizao fotoana izao
We need it this year.	mila izany isika aminity taona ity
He seems to know all the time.	toa fantany ny fotoana rehetra
There were three.	nisy telo
No, not anymore.	tsia tsy izany intsony
Maybe only three.	angamba telo ihany
The bigger picture.	ny sary lehibe kokoa
This is it, and you start all over again.	izao no izao ary manomboka indray ianao
I’m not that stupid.	tsy adala toy izany aho
Without me, he doesn’t have much.	raha tsy misy ahy dia tsy manana zavatra betsaka izy
Then they went quickly.	dia nandeha haingana izy ireo
I think this is generally wrong.	heveriko fa diso izany aminny ankapobeny
Not a lot of time, but it might be enough.	tsy fotoana be fa mety ho ampy
But real life is not so simple.	tsy dia tsotra loatra anefa ny tena fiainana
You will not be wrong.	tsy ho diso ianao
There were a lot of deaths.	be dia be ny maty
The story here follows the present tense.	ny tantara eto dia manaraka ny fotoana ankehitriny
He never has to work hard.	tsy mila miasa mafy mihitsy izy
He knows the stories.	fantany ireo tantara
He wanted nothing more.	tsy nisy tiany intsony
He’s no better, maybe worse.	tsy tsara kokoa izy angamba ratsy kokoa
He had no problem with that.	tsy nanana olana taminizany izy
That is true then.	marina izany raha izany
And it goes well.	ary mandeha tsara
These men did.	nanao izany ireo lehilahy ireo
And now you come as a man.	ary tonga toy ny lehilahy ianao izao
He had seen them before.	efa nahita azy ireo izy taloha
I couldn't do it.	tsy afaka nanao aho
If it suits you.	raha mety aminao izany
One night he lost his mind.	indray alina dia very hevitra izy
Or to each other.	na aminny tsirairay
There should be no surroundings.	tsy tokony hisy ny manodidina azy
At the moment, they are quite large.	aminizao fotoana izao dia somary lehibe izy ireo
We had a little problem at first.	nanana olana kely izahay taminny voalohany
Some like me.	ny sasany toa ahy
They said nothing about it.	tsy nilaza na inona na inona momba izany izy ireo
Never before.	mbola tsy nisy mihitsy
We are the worst of the worst.	isika no ratsy indrindra aminny ratsy indrindra
Now, however, that is it.	ankehitriny anefa dia izany
The reason is no time.	ny antony tsy misy fotoana
But it's not really that.	saingy tsy izany tokoa
It may not be so bad now.	mety tsy dia ratsy loatra izany ankehitriny
I love seeing people like that.	tiako ny mahita olona toy izany
But this is far from normal.	saingy lavitra ny mahazatra izany
Often the food is just right.	matetika ny sakafo dia mety
But that was not the way in real war.	saingy tsy izany no fomba taminny tena ady
Of course, there is no talk of that.	mazava ho azy fa tsy misy resaka momba izany
They do as many jobs as they want.	manao asa maro araka izay tiany izy ireo
That's what he knew.	izany no fantany
It was fun to watch them all.	nahafinaritra ny nijery azy rehetra
We see everything.	mahita ny zavadrehetra isika
This thing.	izao zavatra izao
Totally confused.	very hevitra tanteraka
Now that time has come.	tonga izao izany fotoana izany
But that is also not good.	tsy tsara koa anefa izany
I’m still here though.	mbola eto aho na dia izany aza
Although there wasn’t much to see.	na dia tsy nisy zavatra betsaka ho hita aza
But yes, you are right.	fa eny marina ny anao
The story is too good to be true.	tsara loatra ilay tantara ka tsy ho marina
I’m starting to get the big picture.	manomboka mahazo ny sary lehibe aho
Do it like this.	ataovy toy izao
They got the idea.	nahazo ny hevitra izy ireo
He doesn’t even watch the game.	tsy mijery ny lalao akory izy
It should have been done.	tokony ho natao izany
I still love them when they grow up.	mbola tiako izy ireo rehefa lehibe
We have to disagree again.	tsy maintsy tsy mitovy hevitra indray isika
But it is good to be closer to him.	tsara anefa ny hoe akaiky kokoa azy
It was so nice to have you.	tena nahafinaritra ny nanana anao
I may have had a moment.	mety ho nisy fotoana aho
It should .	tokony ho
There is no way for men.	tsy misy fomba ho anny lehilahy
In any case, there can be no internal maximum.	na izany na tsy izany tsy mety hisy ny ambony indrindra anatiny
I think they are close.	heveriko fa akaiky izy ireo
Anything to do with it.	na inona na inona hanao izany
The idea makes a lot of sense.	tena misy dikany ilay hevitra
First, you need a crazy idea.	voalohany mila hevitra adala ianao
The news works well.	ny vaovao dia miasa tsara
These things never go well.	tsy mandeha tsara mihitsy ireo zavatra ireo
You know that too.	fantatrao koa izany
That must have been the case.	tsy maintsy ho izay no nanao izany
They are not long.	tsy ela izy ireo
He was nothing like before.	tsy nisy toy ny taloha izy
In fact, in some ways as well.	raha ny marina aminny fomba sasany ihany koa
True, some do not, but many do.	marina fa misy tsy manao izany fa maro no manao izany
It will always be so for them.	ho toy izany foana izany ho azy ireo
And these options are not alone.	ary tsy irery ireo safidy ireo
They got the real thing.	nahazo ny tena izy ireo
No, the other one.	tsia ny iray hafa
But not without it.	saingy tsy raha tsy misy azy
Much better this way, in fact.	tsara lavitra aminity fomba ity raha ny marina
Great work around.	asa lehibe manodidina
Maybe he didn’t tell her.	angamba tsy nilaza taminy izy
He could have walked well without it.	afaka nandeha tsara izy raha tsy nisy anio
It can be done well.	azo atao tsara izany
Maybe this woman is not alone.	angamba tsy io vehivavy io irery
The information is uncertain.	tsy azo antoka ny vaovao
I was wrong about how easy it would be.	diso aho ny aminny hoe ho mora izany
Don't come here.	aza tonga eto
Maybe that’s a long way off.	lavitra angamba izany
We have just arrived.	vao avy tonga izahay
You can't have them.	tsy afaka manana azy ireo
They were both fun.	nahafinaritra izy roa
However, he goes for it.	na izany aza dia mandeha aminizany izy
A man who is far better.	lehilahy izay tsara lavitra
But, it’s not about me.	saingy tsy momba ahy izany
I saw something, but it wasn’t.	nahita zavatra aho fa tsy izany
Maybe more than good.	angamba mihoatra noho ny tsara
I'm just.	fotsiny aho
Night like many others.	alina toy ny maro hafa
People you will love.	ny olona ho tianao
I don’t have it right now.	tsy manana izany aminizao fotoana izao
But we had to start somewhere.	tsy maintsy nanomboka tany ho any anefa izahay
Now, however, they find themselves in a difficult position.	aminizao fotoana izao anefa dia mahita ny tenany ao aminny toerana sarotra izy ireo
It’s a way of the world.	fomba iray misy eo aminizao tontolo izao izany
You should be there.	tokony ho any ianao
She is not like other women.	tsy toy ny vehivavy hafa izy
And it will still be there.	ary mbola ho hita eo izany
When we lose someone close to us, nothing is normal.	rehefa very olona akaiky antsika isika dia tsy misy zavatra mahazatra
All right, look.	tsara daholo jereo
You know it will come, and it will come.	fantatrao fa ho avy izany ary ho avy
There is only one small problem.	iray ihany ny olana kely
I just got that news.	vao nahazo izany vaovao izany aho
He loves it about them.	tiany izany momba azy ireo
The place has looked much better.	efa nijery tsara kokoa ilay toerana
I think we can start anytime now.	heveriko fa afaka manomboka aminny fotoana rehetra isika izao
They looked up and down.	nijery ambony sy ambany izy ireo
The truth is there.	eo ny marina
The process went well.	nandeha tsara ny dingana
But this is very difficult.	tena sarotra anefa izany
We hope this is not the case.	manantena izahay fa tsy izany no izy
He thanks me.	misaotra ahy izy
Each step is more difficult than it should be.	sarotra kokoa noho ny tokony ho izy ny dingana tsirairay
So there was no other option.	noho izany dia tsy nisy safidy hafa
He started once.	nanomboka indray mandeha izy
Or that he loves me again.	na hoe tia ahy indray izy
They are simple and complete.	tsotra sy feno izy ireo
Life begins again.	manomboka indray ny fiainana
The fight is harder.	mafy kokoa ny ady
One that you don’t want to go wrong !.	iray izay tsy tianao ho diso
It seems more like that.	toa bebe kokoa izany
But he didn’t see a real fight.	saingy tsy nahita ady tena izy
And that’s true of me, too.	ary marina izany tamiko koa
Of course there was a game.	mazava ho azy fa nisy lalao
Never see him alone.	aza mahita azy irery mihitsy
And all the men.	ary ny lehilahy rehetra
He paused when he saw it.	nijanona kely izy rehefa nahita izany
But there was another problem.	nisy olana hafa anefa
He doesn't like women.	tsy tia vehivavy izy
It is theirs, not yours.	azy ireo izany fa tsy anao
We will do more like that.	mbola hanao zavatra bebe kokoa toy izany izahay
But the work went well.	nandeha tsara anefa ny asa
No, he has an idea.	tsia manana hevitra izy
Maybe the money was there.	teo angamba ilay vola
It was almost as bad for me as they were.	saika ratsy tamiko toa azy ireo ihany izany
It’s always been perfect.	foana tanteraka izany
People have ideas.	ny olona manana hevitra
There is no other way you can.	tsy misy fomba hafa azonao atao
New facts.	zavamisy vaovao
You should be very happy.	tokony ho faly be ianao
I am a man in real life.	lehilahy aho aminny tena fiainana
But that can be difficult at times.	mety ho sarotra anefa izany indraindray
And no one gets it.	ary tsy misy mahazo izany
Yes, it is.	eny toy izany
But we must be sure.	tsy maintsy mahazo antoka anefa isika
They have gone too far.	lasa lavitra loatra izy ireo
I watched them go fast.	nijery azy ireo nandeha haingana aho
Now, the game is much different.	aminizao fotoana izao ny lalao dia hafa lavitra
But you should know that this is not new to me.	fa tokony ho fantatrao fa tsy vaovao amiko izany
I have something about him now.	manana zavatra momba azy aho izao
Then everyone wants to come.	dia samy te ho avy daholo
So there are many reasons.	noho izany dia misy antony maro
I know you know that.	fantatro fa fantatrao izany
He’s a perfect fit.	tena mety tsara izy
Unless he did something.	raha tsy hoe nanao zavatra izy
There are good options.	misy safidy tsara
However, there are many problems with this approach.	na izany aza misy olana maro aminity fomba ity
No one is going to do that right now.	tsy misy olona hanao izany aminizao fotoana izao
Now there was a clearer and more complete idea.	ankehitriny dia efa nisy hevitra mazava kokoa sy tanteraka
I'm better now, he told her.	tsara kokoa aho izao hoy izy taminy
Not too hard, but close.	tsy tena sarotra fa akaiky
It's too small.	kely loatra izany
And make no mistake, it’s a lot.	ary aza diso be dia be izany
I'm not good enough.	tsy ampy mihitsy aho
This is what makes the world so beautiful.	izany no tena mahafinaritra izao tontolo izao
Some have already done so.	ny sasany efa nanao
If they love you, they will still love you.	raha tia anao izy ireo dia mbola ho tia anao
However, we are still doing it.	na izany aza dia mbola manao izany izahay
Don’t go any earlier.	aza mandeha any aloha kokoa
They all look at him carefully.	samy mijery azy tsara izy rehetra
It’s all like that.	toy izany rehetra izany
Kind of hard.	karazana sarotra
The problem is clear.	mazava ny olana
It also comes at the wrong time.	tonga aminny fotoana tsy mety koa izany
But that no longer makes sense.	tsy misy dikany intsony anefa izany
No problem here.	tsy misy olana eto
Well, he couldn’t do anything about it.	eny tsy afaka nanao na inona na inona momba izany izy
We didn’t think too much.	tsy nieritreritra be loatra izahay
I know you are there.	fantatro fa eo ianao
We are nothing but a problem.	tsy inona izahay fa olana
I don't have it now.	tsy manana izany aho izao
It will not be so for you.	tsy ho toy izany ho anao
Not here.	tsy eto
Then they just do it.	dia manao izany fotsiny izy ireo
But that’s all it is.	saingy izany ihany no izy
Adults have to do something else.	tsy maintsy manao zavatra hafa ny lehibe
You are often alone.	matetika ianao irery
He said the same thing.	nilaza izany koa izy
It is still very important.	mbola tena ilaina izany
Whatever it is, it can’t be that bad.	na inona na inona izany dia tsy mety ho ratsy izany
Otherwise, we will be lost.	raha tsy izany dia ho very izahay
There is a place for you here.	misy toerana ho anao eto
Now I still can’t.	ankehitriny dia mbola tsy afaka
But more importantly, they come from afar.	fa ny tena zavadehibe dia avy lavitra izy ireo
There is even better news to come.	mbola misy vaovao tsara kokoa ho avy
But there is something wrong with the work.	saingy misy zavatra ratsy eo aminny asa
But for once, there is no question.	saingy indray mandeha tsy misy fanontaniana
But no one saw him.	tsy nisy nahita azy anefa
At first, the task was difficult.	aminny voalohany dia sarotra ny asa
You can only get it.	afaka mahazo izany ihany ianao
Sounds good as news.	toa tsara toy ny vaovao
The pictures are not too bad.	tsy dia ratsy loatra ny sary
And if not, it’s still great.	ary raha tsy izany dia mbola lehibe
Maybe they will never come.	angamba tsy ho avy mihitsy izy ireo
If you’ve had them, you know it.	raha nanana azy ireo ianao dia fantatrao izany
You enjoy being together.	mahafinaritra anao ny miaraka
The surroundings are different.	samy hafa ny manodidina
But we found another house.	nahita trano hafa anefa izahay
Everything seems to be going well.	toa mandeha tsara daholo ny rehetra
It is wrong to dislike them.	tsy mety ny tsy tia azy ireo
But in the end he came.	saingy taminny farany dia tonga izy
You can probably get it very easily.	azonao atao angamba ny mahazo azy aminny tena mora
Yes, but they are.	eny fa izy ireo
You are fast.	haingana ianao
He never saw her.	tsy nahita azy mihitsy izy
He has nothing to lose.	tsy manana na inona na inona ho very izy
If they are, see if the two things are the same.	raha misy izy ireo dia jereo raha mitovy ny zavatra roa
It was news to me.	nisy vaovao tamiko io
Another day.	andro hafa
There would not have been enough space for them.	tsy ho nisy toerana ampy ho azy ireo
He may lose everything.	mety ho very ny zavadrehetra izy
The two did not seem to be in this place.	toa tsy nisy tao aminity toerana ity izy roa
He is really stupid.	tena adala tokoa izy
Some are small.	ny sasany dia kely
And he couldn't tell her.	ary tsy afaka nilaza taminy izy
There are almost every step of the old game.	saika misy ny dingana rehetra aminny lalao taloha
We did the work.	nanao ny asa izahay
He went too hard.	nandeha mafy loatra izy
Some are really fun.	ny sasany dia tena mahafinaritra
This is a first for me.	ity no voalohany ho ahy
With war, it’s not that anymore.	miaraka aminny ady dia tsy izany intsony
You never come.	tsy tonga mihitsy ianao
Sometimes you see things like that.	nahita zavatra toy izany ianao indraindray
One quick thing about the timing of these.	zavatra iray haingana momba ny fotoana aminireo
He’s not too bad either.	tsy dia ratsy loatra koa izy
He has grown up.	efa lehibe be izy
Then you don’t really know him.	dia tsy tena fantatrao izy
And then we may not.	ary avy eo dia mety tsy isika
It will be easy to do.	ho mora ny manao izany
But there was nothing unusual.	saingy tsy nisy na inona na inona mahazatra
Everything seems new to them.	toa vaovao aminizy ireo ny zavadrehetra
But they are no longer the best.	saingy efa tsy ny tsara indrindra izy ireo
No one went.	tsy nisy nandeha na iray aza
Of course you don’t want to go there.	mazava ho azy fa tsy te ho any ianao
He could not look far.	tsy afaka nijery lavitra izy
We certainly have that.	azo antoka fa manana izany isika
If you don’t need to do it, it doesn’t work.	raha tsy mila manao izany ianao dia tsy miasa izany
Others will come to this vast land.	ho tonga eto aminity tany be dia be ity ny hafa
These wonderful people did exist in real life.	tena nisy teo aminny tena fiainana tokoa ireo olona mahafinaritra ireo
So, you have to have variety.	noho izany dia tsy maintsy manana karazana
I was able to do it again.	afaka nanao izany indray aho
Yes, just like the real thing.	eny toy ny tena izy
Here again you have another option.	eto indray dia manana safidy hafa ianao
Maybe he did.	angamba izy nanao izany
But one is for the other.	fa ny iray dia noho ny iray hafa
But it didn't go well.	tsy nandeha araka ny tokony ho izy anefa izany
We may want to do something else.	mety te hanao zavatra hafa isika
You are more beautiful than ever.	tsara tarehy noho ny taloha ianao
But not your real one.	fa tsy ny tena anao
It is very important.	tena zavadehibe ilay izy
But someone was there.	saingy nisy olona teo
He will do it today.	hanao izany izy anio
We are all dead.	maty isika rehetra
However, we do.	na izany aza manao izany izahay
We did things like it was impossible.	nanao zavatra toy ny hoe tsy azo atao izahay
But he didn't have it.	tsy nanana izany anefa izy
Don't be silly now.	aza manao adala izao
He may have been too wrong.	efa diso be loatra angamba izy
See that it is real.	jereo fa tena izy
This is the new reason.	izany no antony vaovao
See him at all times.	jereo izy aminny fotoana rehetra
And yes, that is not possible.	ary eny tsy azo atao izany
It’s probably two steps.	dingana roa angamba izany
True, they have lost their way.	marina fa very lalana izy ireo
This is bad news now.	vaovao ratsy izany ankehitriny
To me, this is not a debate.	amiko dia tsy ady hevitra izany
I don't even need to look.	tsy mila mijery akory aho
You can't be.	tsy mety ho ianao
This is exactly what has never happened before.	izany mihitsy no mbola tsy nisy toy izany
We are really alone here.	tena irery izahay eto
You always did and will always do.	nanao foana ianao ary hanao izany foana
This is the best part of everything.	io no ampahany tsara indrindra aminny zavadrehetra
Time is wasted.	very hevitra ny fotoana
And they are just like us.	ary mitovy aminny antsika izy ireo
No, it doesn't suit him.	tsia tsy mety aminy izany
He looked at the houses nearby.	nijery ireo trano teo akaiky teo izy
And now they have one.	ary izao dia manana iray izy ireo
I also had a job.	nanana asa koa aho
It certainly did.	azo antoka fa nanao izany
It doesn't seem to be complete.	toa tsy feno ilay izy
And he doesn’t want you to get lost.	ary tsy tiany ho very hevitra ianao
Make them seem insignificant.	ataovy toa tsy misy dikany izy ireo
There was no truth.	tsy nisy marina
But it is a bit difficult.	somary sarotra anefa izany
But it was good for me.	tsara ho ahy anefa izany
Without it, he knew it would be different.	raha tsy nisy azy dia fantany fa ho hafa izany
Women deserve to make choices for themselves.	ny vehivavy dia mendrika ny hanao ny safidy ho anny tenany
Another one that day.	iray hafa taminizany andro izany
He can get a better job.	afaka mahazo asa tsara kokoa izy
We didn’t have to make a choice.	tsy nila nanao safidy izahay
You are not very good.	tsy dia tsara loatra ianao
People with problems.	olona manana olana
I found it very difficult.	hitako fa sarotra be ilay izy
Too many people won’t do that.	maro dia maro ny olona tsy hanao izany
Just one of them.	iray aminizy ireo ihany
Sometimes we are wrong.	diso isika indraindray
And they work hard at it.	ary miasa mafy aminizany izy ireo
More than a fool.	mihoatra noho ny adala
More difficult.	sarotra kokoa
I don’t like it any more than you.	tsy tiako mihoatra anao izany
There is also the surefire.	misy ihany koa ny azo antoka
Just the truth.	ny marina ihany
Nothing, they are long gone.	tsy misy na inona na inona efa ela izy ireo no lasa
Thanks again for all of that.	misaotra indray noho izany rehetra izany
I could see the house a bit.	somary hitako ilay trano
If you only knew.	raha mba fantatrao
This is really fun.	tena mahafinaritra ity
But they are still big.	mbola lehibe ihany anefa ireo
And really now.	ary tena izao
No one had ever done such a thing to him.	tsy mbola nisy olona nanao ny marina toy izany taminy
He has to find something for himself.	tsy maintsy mahita zavatra ho azy manokana izy
You need more.	mila bebe kokoa ianao
They don’t even exist.	izy ireo aza tsy misy
Not very clear.	tsy mazava tsara
This is certainly not the first time.	azo antoka fa tsy vao voalohany izany
He gets me.	mahazo ahy izy
This is still true.	mbola marina izany
I acted foolishly.	nanao adala aho
We have another problem.	manana olana hafa isika
There are two options.	misy safidy roa
The problem seems to be less.	toa kely kokoa ny olana
We had to do it.	tsy maintsy nanao izany izahay
I enjoyed some.	nahafinaritra ahy ny sasany
As it turns out, it’s better.	araka ny hita dia tsara kokoa
Then he knew he couldn’t.	dia fantany fa tsy afaka
Ideally, it’s a two -way street.	raha ny tokony ho izy dia resaka roa izany
They don’t do that.	tsy manao toy izany izy ireo
It was all there for him.	teo izy rehetra ho azy
We do it for you.	manao izany ho anao izahay
I just looked at him.	nijery azy fotsiny aho
It’s important here.	zavadehibe eto
Everyone will be there.	ho any daholo ny rehetra
That's enough.	efa ampy izany
That must be a bad thing.	tsy maintsy ho zavatra ratsy izany
Make sure it reaches the bottom.	ataovy azo antoka fa tonga any aminny farany ambany
But he is there.	fa eo izy
But one thing.	zavatra iray anefa
Then I will know.	dia ho fantatro izany
I don't need you.	tsy mila anao aho
Maybe they are not all the same.	angamba tsy mitovy izy rehetra
I totally think so.	heveriko tanteraka izany
They are often short of money.	matetika izy ireo no tsy ampy vola
This is not all bad.	tsy hoe ratsy daholo izany
But he stayed longer than that.	nijanona ela kokoa noho izany anefa izy
It should be very low.	tokony ho ambany dia ambany
I need a more private place.	mila toerana manokana kokoa aho
A completely different image.	sary hafa tanteraka
That is not the only fact.	tsy izany ihany no zavamisy
Many other women also had it.	vehivavy maro hafa koa no nanana azy
It was immediately a bad game.	avy hatrany dia lalao ratsy izany
Usually a good car.	matetika fiara tsara
You may be the last.	mety ho ianao no farany
But again, maybe not.	saingy indray angamba tsy izany
And it’s as good as it can be.	ary tsara araka izay azo atao izany
So they expect great things.	noho izany dia manantena zavatra lehibe izy ireo
There are three types of excellent women.	misy karazana vehivavy telo tena tsara
It was important because I had a similar problem.	zavadehibe satria nanana olana mitovy aminizany aho
Nothing to do there.	tsy misy atao any
Better than the first.	tsara kokoa noho ny voalohany
Especially with women.	indrindra aminny vehivavy
They are all very different.	tena samy hafa izy rehetra
I was already there.	efa teo aho
Not that they are free, though.	tsy hoe afaka izy ireo na izany aza
We look at the road.	mijery ny lalana izahay
They must be meaningless.	tsy maintsy tsy misy dikany izy ireo
You won’t be long, though.	tsy ho ela ianao na izany aza
And he needed to do it.	ary nila nanao izany izy
But for me it was worth it.	saingy ho ahy dia mendrika izany
Not much, not enough, but some.	tsy betsaka tsy ampy fa ny sasany
Yes, it is far away.	eny dia lavitra ilay izy
You look crazy.	toa adala ianao
There was no time.	tsy nisy fotoana
Sometimes we were one or two.	indraindray izahay dia iray na roa
However, it is not here or there.	na izany aza tsy eto na any izany
The last two years have been a bit crazy.	ny roa taona farany dia somary adala
They soon did.	tsy ela dia nanao izany izy ireo
I have never seen you like that.	mbola tsy nahita anao toy izany aho
Different for everyone.	hafa ho anny rehetra
I think the bigger the better.	heveriko fa ny lehibe kokoa no tsara kokoa
But it is already beginning to fill up.	efa manomboka feno anefa izany
I will not do it here.	tsy hanao izany eto aho
Because he knew he was right.	satria fantany fa marina izy
Designed especially to be invisible.	natao indrindra mba tsy ho hita
I know him too.	fantatro koa izy
It is all.	dia ny rehetra
Yes, this is probably the easiest route for him.	eny io angamba no lalana mora indrindra ho azy
And that’s still almost untrue.	ary mbola saika tsy marina izany
I really needed a house.	tena nila trano aho
I am something completely different.	zavatra hafa tanteraka aho
None of them do the work.	tsy misy aminizy ireo manao ny asa
We may need to do something with them.	mety mila manao zavatra aminizy ireo isika
I can get a job easily.	afaka mahazo asa mora aho
Don’t make it difficult.	aza atao sarotra
I think this place is perfect.	heveriko fa mety io toerana io
They are here, and then gone.	eto izy ireo ary avy eo dia lasa
They will not be wrong.	tsy ho diso izy ireo
See you.	mahita anao
This is a very different person.	olona hafa tokoa io
Many still do not.	mbola maro no tsy manao izany
But not everyone is bad.	tsy ny rehetra anefa no ratsy
There are so many of them to see.	be dia be izy ireo ho hita
I want it for me.	te ho ahy aho
Of course, this is not a simple battle.	mazava ho azy fa tsy ady tsotra izany
Yes, it may not be so good.	eny mety tsy dia tsara izany
The money is safe.	ny vola dia azo antoka
Designed for men.	natao ho anny lehilahy
Not better or worse.	tsy tsara na ratsy kokoa
What is missing? 	inona no very
That's enough about that.	ampy izay ny momba izany
The first is the most recent.	ny voalohany dia vao haingana indrindra
Next time.	aminny manaraka indray
This is the problem again.	ity indray no olana
But he walks people.	mandeha olona anefa izy
There are some that are worth a lot of money.	misy ny sasany izay mendrika ny vola be
We are more than three than one.	mihoatra ny telo noho ny iray isika
You don’t follow the surroundings that’s it.	tsy manaraka ny manodidina ianao dia izay
He needed it now.	nila izany izy izao
Land is not needed.	tsy ilaina ny tany
But he is not stupid.	saingy tsy adala izy
A small part is also visible.	hita koa ny ampahany kely iray
We enjoyed watching.	nahafinaritra izahay nijery
It’s something else for me.	zavatra hafa amiko izany
Do what you want, but it won’t make sense.	ataovy izay tianao fa tsy hisy dikany izany
The pictures are not the same.	tsy mitovy ny sary
But sometimes more than others.	saingy indraindray mihoatra noho ny hafa
When there is one, there are two.	rehefa misy iray dia misy roa
He didn't think so.	tsy nieritreritra toy izany izy
However, it is good.	na izany aza tsara izany
He had something about it.	nanana zavatra momba izany izy
The car did not work.	tsy nandeha ny fiara
And maybe he knows that too.	ary angamba fantany izany koa
We are all alone.	irery isika rehetra
Everything was in the right place.	ny zavadrehetra dia tany aminny toerana tokony hisy azy
Everyone makes more money.	mahazo vola bebe kokoa ny tsirairay
Choice, choice, always choice.	safidy safidy safidy foana
I'm glad to still see him.	faly aho mbola mahita azy
I am driving.	mandeha fiara aho
Proximity is important.	zavadehibe ny akaiky
They must want to do that.	tsy maintsy te hanao izany izy ireo
Yields are also low.	ny vokatra dia ambany ihany koa
That seems like enough.	toa ampy izay
It’s never fun at all.	tsy mahafinaritra mihitsy na inona na inona
However, he is right.	na izany aza marina ny azy
I thought well.	nieritreritra tsara aho
That’s his favorite part.	izany no ampahany tiany indrindra
But you didn’t tell me why.	fa ianao tsy nilaza tamiko ny antony
Anything ordinary.	na inona na inona mahazatra
To do something better.	mba hanao zavatra tsara kokoa
Everything is available.	misy ny zavadrehetra
I just want you to know.	tiako ho fantatrao fotsiny
It's a clear day again.	andro mazava indray izao
They made a great meal without words.	nanao sakafo lehibe tsy nisy teny izy ireo
It was a fun thing.	zavatra nahafinaritra izany
And when he said these were good, they were good.	ary rehefa nilaza izy fa tsara ireo dia tsara ireo
She will be beautiful one day, she said.	ho tsara tarehy izy indray andro any hoy izy
This is not the first time this.	tsy izao no fotoana voalohany aminity
And here it goes.	ary izao no mandeha
But that is not the only way.	tsy izany ihany anefa no lalana
Good timing.	fotoana mety tsara
It works a little.	miasa kely izy io
And they are all beautiful.	ary tsara tarehy izy rehetra
Then they were always there.	avy eo dia nisy foana izy ireo
It's easy to do.	tsotra ny manao izany
And it’s good at any time of the year.	ary tsara izany aminny fotoana rehetra aminny taona
Work is very important.	tena zavadehibe ny asa
Of these two.	aminireo roa ireo
There isn’t much you can do about it.	tsy misy zavatra betsaka azonao atao momba izany
It should be available now.	tokony ho hita aminizao fotoana izao izany
For one there, a lot.	ho anny iray teo be dia be
He made himself very useful.	nanao ny tenany ho tena ilaina izy
This is not a good day.	tsy andro tsara izany
No work is too low.	tsy misy asa ambany loatra
And that’s an old question.	ary fanontaniana taloha izany
Or, he can’t.	na tsy afaka izy
So, do it.	noho izany ataovy izany
That’s the crazy talk.	izay ilay resaka adala
I think that’s fun.	heveriko ho mahafinaritra izany
It’s just that simple.	tsotra fotsiny izany
Both are very important.	samy tena zavadehibe
It is a matter of fact.	resaka zavamisy io
Yes, that doesn’t seem to make sense.	eny toa tsy misy dikany izany
We don’t need it anymore.	tsy mila intsony izahay
He is not a very talkative person.	tsy dia olona be resaka izy
Then, he often did.	avy eo matetika izy no nanao izany
In fact, neither of us did.	raha ny marina dia samy tsy nanao izany izahay
Don't go.	aza mandeha
No one really does that.	tsy misy manao izany tokoa
Kind of like that.	karazana toa azy
Things are really bad.	tena ratsy tokoa ny zavatra
This is far from news.	lavitra ny vaovao izany
So someone has to watch them.	noho izany dia tsy maintsy misy olona mijery azy ireo
I am most happy.	tena faly aho indrindra
I really like it there.	tena tiako kokoa any
It's yours.	anao izy
The question came hard and fast.	tonga mafy sy haingana ny fanontaniana
Maybe there will be a time.	angamba hisy fotoana iray
One is smaller.	ny iray dia kely kokoa
I will be easy for all of us.	ho mora ho antsika rehetra aho
Everyone is always very happy when they arrive.	faly be foana ny rehetra rehefa tonga
But if you do.	fa raha manao izany ianao
He belongs to a place.	anny toerana iray izy
Some are just bad days.	ny sasany dia andro ratsy fotsiny
I love bad days.	tiako ny andro ratsy
Now we have seen it well.	ankehitriny isika dia nahita azy tsara
What a game this is.	lalao inona ity
He can't do it for himself.	tsy afaka manao izany ho anny tenany izy
Everything seems pointless to me.	toa tsy misy dikany amiko ny zavadrehetra
More importantly it comes perfectly together.	ny zavadehibe kokoa dia tonga miaraka tanteraka
And they are often worse.	ary matetika izy ireo no ratsy kokoa
It’s him, you might say.	azy io hoy angamba ianao
That’s exactly what it’s all about.	tena izay ihany koa no misy azy
Yes, it made sense to me, but.	eny nisy dikany tamiko izany saingy
You can't die.	tsy mety maty ianao
If you do the same, fine.	raha manao izany koa ianao tsara
I'm from nowhere.	avy tsy misy aho
However, there are questions.	na izany aza misy fanontaniana
Some of it didn't make sense.	tsy nisy dikany ny sasany taminizany
There is always a way around it.	misy fomba foana manodidina azy
We are real.	tena misy isika
If anyone could have done it, we would have done it.	raha nisy olona afaka nanao izany dia ho nanao izany izahay
We’ve seen this event, but it’s not close.	efa nahita ity hetsika ity izahay saingy tsy akaiky
The problem is now just the problem.	ny olana dia izao fotsiny ny olana
And they will never know, for sure.	ary tsy ho fantany mihitsy tsy azo antoka
He seemed safe and pleasant.	toa azo antoka sy nahafinaritra izy
Look at all the facts.	jereo ny zavamisy rehetra
We never had a problem then.	tsy nanana olana mihitsy izahay taminizany
There was a place for him.	nisy toerana ho azy
There were two obvious reasons.	nisy antony roa mazava
But women are not like that.	saingy tsy toy izany ny vehivavy
So it is not possible.	ka tsy azo atao izany
No, it's not about money.	tsia tsy resaka vola io
We are here now, not you.	eto izahay izao fa tsy ianao
One big reason is timing.	ny antony lehibe iray dia ny fotoana
Nothing could be more accurate.	tsy misy zavatra mety ho marina kokoa
No, that is very true.	tsia tena marina izany
He still doesn't have it.	mbola tsy manana izy
They have the time.	manana ny fotoana izy ireo
Look closely at them.	jereo mafy izy ireo
So now it goes.	ka izao dia mandeha
She is very beautiful, when she grows up.	tena tsara tarehy izy raha lehibe
It's not his at all.	tsy azy mihitsy izany
Not in this place, but one I really love.	tsy eto aminity toerana ity fa iray tena tia azy
Of course it’s worth it.	mazava ho azy fa mendrika izany
I am happy now.	faly aho aminizao fotoana izao
The world is yours.	anao izao tontolo izao
It is one of the two,.	iray aminizy roa izy io
The car stopped hard.	nijanona mafy ilay fiara
I really like this one.	tena tiako ity iray ity
You can do anything out of it.	afaka manao na inona na inona avy aminizany ianao
Very fast in words.	tena haingana aminny teny
I really don’t need another.	tena tsy mila hafa aho
This can be difficult at first.	mety ho sarotra izany aminny voalohany
And they didn’t last long.	ary tsy ela izy ireo
I need to start this soon.	mila manomboka izany tsy ho ela aho
When he dies, everyone else dies too.	raha maty izy dia maty koa ny hafa rehetra
We are doing more than ever.	manao mihoatra noho ny taloha izahay
And we did it very early.	ary nanao izany aloha be izahay
In fact, they never did.	raha ny marina dia tsy nanao izany mihitsy izy ireo
And we are still here.	ary mbola eto isika
I need to know about him.	mila ny momba azy aho
No need to fight again.	tsy ilaina ny ady indray
Then the day passed.	dia lasa ny andro
There is something for everyone.	misy zavatra ho anny tsirairay
Te.	te
But, it’s still very important.	saingy mbola tena zavadehibe izany
That might be a good thing to do.	mety ho zavatra tsara atao izany
He knew he really liked it.	fantany fa tena tiany izany
Because he is alone.	satria irery izy
But there are some really good ones.	saingy misy ny sasany tena tsara
Like it or not, they have something.	na tianao na tsy tianao manana zavatra izy ireo
Especially since he’s actually a handsome man.	indrindra fa raha ny tena izy dia lehilahy tsara tarehy
I don't know which one.	tsy fantatro izay iray
I don’t find that difficult.	tsy hitako ho sarotra izany
Now and then.	aminizao sy izao
So are words.	toy izany koa ny teny
Finally, the day came.	farany tonga ny andro
Life there was not easy.	tsy mora ny fiainana tany
He can do that thing.	afaka manao izany zavatra izany izy
That’s another idea for me.	hevitra hafa koa izany amiko
First of all, this is not true.	voalohany indrindra tsy marina izany
But, in general this is not true.	saingy aminny ankapobeny dia tsy marina izany
Pretty hard, actually.	somary mafy raha ny marina
It was all new to me.	vaovao tamiko daholo izany
said the woman.	hoy ilay vehivavy
And your surroundings are clear.	ary mazava tsara ny manodidina anao
Either way, you’ll know it.	na izany na tsy izany dia ho fantatrao izany
He is not really a man or woman.	tsy tena lehilahy vehivavy izy
We never had a new car.	tsy nanana fiara vaovao mihitsy izahay
It’s still not the same.	mbola tsy mitovy izany
Everything is very clear.	mazava tsara ny zavadrehetra
It looks like one.	toa iray izany
Of course, it also works well.	mazava ho azy fa miasa tsara ihany koa izy io
I don’t like them very much.	tsy dia tia azy ireo loatra
However, nothing came of it.	na izany aza tsy nisy na inona na inona tonga taminizany
He will come after you.	ho avy manaraka anao izy
I can never come.	tsy afaka tonga mihitsy aho
They are from here.	avy eto izy ireo
They go faster than anything.	mandeha haingana kokoa noho ny zavatra rehetra izy ireo
It may be gone.	mety ho lasa izany
At what point do we have enough of it.	aminny fotoana inona isika no manana ny ampy ao
However, it started.	na izany aza dia nanomboka izany
He knew one was coming.	fantany fa ho avy ny iray
Very bad because both are good products.	tena ratsy satria samy vokatra tsara
And he deserves it.	ary mendrika izany izy
Way too far.	fomba lavitra be
But it was too fast.	haingana loatra anefa izany
It can be completely spontaneous.	mety ho tonga ho azy tanteraka izany
It’s always hard to see people coming or going.	sarotra foana ny mahita olona tonga na mandeha
Of course, there’s a kind of game going on here.	mazava ho azy fa misy karazana lalao mandeha eto
That's what I think.	izany no heveriko
When everything is too much.	rehefa be loatra ny zavadrehetra
Then he knew where he was.	dia fantany izay nisy azy
I don’t really know.	tsy tena fantany aho
This is the safest home for us.	io no trano azo antoka indrindra ho anay
I really like the place too.	tena tiako koa ilay toerana
I'm not here.	tsy eto aho
See you in the game !.	mahita anao aminny lalao
It’s really not good at all.	tena tsy tsara mihitsy
And he doesn’t like it here.	ary tsy tiany izany eto
That’s a good thing.	tsara izany zavatra iray izany
There is no other way now.	tsy misy fomba hafa izao
Nothing is gained, and much is lost.	tsy misy azo ary betsaka ny very
Both are not close, but still.	samy tsy akaiky fa mbola
But then it stopped.	nijanona anefa izany avy eo
We all have to start somewhere.	tsy maintsy manomboka any ho any isika rehetra
But he didn't look at me.	tsy nijery ahy anefa izy
For others, this is a big problem.	ho anny hafa dia olana lehibe izany
I have more too.	manana bebe kokoa koa aho
Some are very complex and some are simple.	ny sasany dia sarotra be ary ny sasany dia tsotra
No, another way.	tsia fomba hafa
She loves her surroundings.	tiany ny manodidina azy
I've never been like that before.	mbola tsy mba toy izany mihitsy aho
He will never be found again.	tsy ho hita intsony izy
But it’s okay.	saingy mety izany
But they are good people.	olona tsara anefa izy ireo
We thought so.	nieritreritra izany izahay
The food is really bad.	tena ratsy ny sakafo
The right place.	ny toerana mety
They don’t just go there.	tsy mandeha any fotsiny izy ireo
But mine don't.	fa ny ahy tsy manao
And now it is gone.	ary izao dia lasa
He couldn't think of another way.	tsy afaka nieritreritra fomba hafa izy
Both are good of course.	samy tsara mazava ho azy
This question is important.	zavadehibe io fanontaniana io
Here, it is not.	eto tsy izany no izy
In a way, though.	aminny fomba na izany aza
To me the last one is missing.	amiko ny farany ihany no tsy hita
So much more than usual.	be lavitra noho ny mahazatra
It is an immediate result.	vokatra avy hatrany izy io
Clearly we are.	mazava fa isika
A beautiful car that is true.	fiara tsara tarehy izay marina
This in itself works well, but one thing is wrong.	izany mihitsy no miasa tsara saingy zavatra iray no tsy mety
If they did, they did.	raha nanao izany izy ireo dia nanao izany
And the work is not difficult.	ary tsy sarotra ny asa
Everything is yours to see.	anao izao rehetra izao mba ho hita
And he did.	ary nanao izany
But he knew, for sure.	fa fantany azo antoka
All of this was done at one time and place.	ireo rehetra ireo dia natao taminny fotoana sy toerana iray
The bad ground.	ny tany ratsy
No, it's something else.	tsia zavatra hafa ilay izy
But it still doesn’t make sense.	saingy mbola tsy misy dikany izany
I look at people in particular.	mijery ny olona manokana aho
It could be that simple.	mety ho tsotra toy izany
He will never do that.	tsy hanao izany mihitsy izy
He also looked good.	nijery tsara koa izy
They should be as close as possible.	tokony ho akaiky araka izay azo atao izy ireo
He had done the right thing to her.	efa nanao ny marina taminy izy
He is still good.	mbola tsara foana izy
Even if you haven’t seen him, you love him.	na dia tsy nahita azy aza ianao dia tia azy
He knew it would come to him.	fantany fa ho tonga aminy izany
And he didn’t have an easy job.	ary tsy nanana asa mora be izy
He called himself crazy.	nilaza ny tenany izy fa adala
You are not very good to me.	tsy dia tsara loatra amiko ianao
But they are a little foolish to do so.	somary adala anefa izy ireo raha manao izany
It was a great idea.	tena hevitra lehibe ilay izy
So it was new to me.	ka dia vaovao tamiko izany
All of which makes more sense.	izany rehetra izany dia misy dikany bebe kokoa
He is not there.	tsy misy izy
I think it’s very possible.	heveriko fa tena azo atao izany
we said.	hoy izahay
However, he had other news.	na izany aza dia nanana vaovao hafa izy
He certainly had a choice.	azo antoka fa nanana safidy izy
Women are not good.	tsy tsara ny vehivavy
I see him like this.	hitako toy izao izy
There was still nothing.	mbola tsy nisy na inona na inona
I will not do that again.	tsy hanao izany intsony aho
But this will not be the case.	tsy ho toy izao anefa izany
It just comes to you.	tonga aminao fotsiny izany
It's too hard.	mafy loatra izany
We always have, we always do.	manana foana isika hanao izany foana
You can do this at any time.	azonao atao izany aminny fotoana rehetra
The situation here is very different.	hafa mihitsy ny zavamisy eto
But not all.	saingy tsy ny rehetra
There are men.	misy lehilahy
He did not like the people close to him.	tsy tiany ny olona akaiky azy
They are so much fun for you.	tena mahafinaritra ho anao izy ireo
Therefore, no action is required.	noho izany tsy mila hetsika na inona na inona
Tonight is the last trip.	anio alina no dia farany
He never said that though.	tsy nilaza izany mihitsy izy na dia izany aza
Yes, the last man.	eny ilay lehilahy farany
This is the dead man.	io ilay maty
Then go as far as possible.	dia mandeha araka izay azo atao
Personal choice is not so important.	tsy dia zavadehibe loatra ny safidy manokana
But you don't love me.	tsy tia ahy anefa ianao
That can be important.	mety ho zavadehibe izany
I’m very much there.	tena betsaka aho any
But we are not far away.	mbola tsy lasa lavitra anefa isika
You might like them.	mety ho tianao izy ireo
And it’s not pretty.	ary tsy tsara tarehy
It didn’t seem like real money, but it did exist.	toa tsy tena vola ilay izy fa nisy tokoa
Not many things are that easy.	tsy maro ny zavatra mora toy izany
He can make it better or worse for me.	afaka manao izany ho tsara kokoa na ratsy ho ahy izy
It is easy for us to follow.	mora ho antsika ny manaraka azy
I know a lot.	betsaka ny zavatra fantatro
I want you to be honest and truthful.	tiako fa marina sy marina ianao
I love it the most.	tiako indrindra izany
That is now.	izany dia izao
But it is not night.	tsy alina anefa izao
And you won’t go far wrong.	ary tsy ho diso lavitra ianao
He has.	manana izy
This is also a good choice.	safidy tsara ihany koa ity
It should be so now, but it’s not.	tokony ho toy izany ankehitriny fa tsy izany
Same as the evil you know.	mitovy aminny ratsy fantatrao hoe
Yes, you go for it.	eny mandeha aminizany ianao
It’s just hard sometimes.	sarotra ihany indraindray
You are not dead yet.	mbola tsy maty ianao
I could have stayed there forever.	afaka nijanona teo foana aho
The fact is, he’s fun.	ny zavamisy dia mahafinaritra izy
We are more than any other species.	mihoatra noho ny karazana rehetra isika
I don’t think they should be.	heveriko fa tsy tokony ho izy ireo
But you don't need me.	fa tsy mila ahy ianao
It seems so too.	toa izany koa
Of course not us.	mazava ho azy fa tsy isika
I hope everything goes well.	manantena aho fa mety ny zavadrehetra
I think you have a question.	heveriko fa manana fanontaniana ianao
It’s a great game.	lalao lehibe izany
We don’t always agree.	tsy mitovy hevitra foana izahay
The man kept going.	nandeha foana ilay lehilahy
But the fool saw nothing there.	fa ny adala dia tsy nahita na inona na inona izy teo
They did come.	tonga tokoa izy ireo
I have life again.	manana fiainana indray aho
The game is really fun.	tena mahafinaritra ny lalao
Finally he was clear again.	farany dia mazava indray izy
I really disagree.	tena tsy mitovy hevitra aho
People like us.	ny olona toa antsika
Got this game.	nahazo ity lalao ity
You should never do that.	tsy tokony hanao izany mihitsy
I love you, he said.	tiako ianao hoy izy
There was not a single one.	tsy nisy olona na dia iray aza
Or maybe you used to.	na angamba ianao taloha
But he could not come.	tsy afaka tonga anefa izy
It is getting late.	efa ho alina ny andro
I seem to see that.	toa hitako izany
That sounds too good, and it’s true.	toa tsara loatra izany ary marina izany
We don't need anyone like you.	tsy mila olona toa anao izahay
It was very simple.	tsotra be ilay izy
I really enjoy it.	tena mahafinaritra ahy izany
This is not the last time for them.	tsy fotoana farany ho azy ireo izao
No one can die like me.	tsy misy olona mety maty toa ahy
The future is near.	ny ho avy tsy ho ela
Nice and simple.	tsara sy tsotra
No problem then.	tsy misy olana raha izany
But it starts with you.	fa manomboka eo aminao izy
or other necessary ideas.	na hevitra hafa ilaina
Anything in the world.	na inona na inona eto aminizao tontolo izao
He can do the same now !.	afaka manao toy izany koa izy izao
And they will know why.	ary ho fantany ny antony
We have all done that.	isika rehetra dia efa nanao izany zavatra izany
It was there, no more.	teo izy io tsy nisy intsony
They are very happy to watch.	tena faly izy ireo mijery
The facts are very small.	tena kely ny zavamisy
I really like the fact.	tena tiako ny zavamisy
There are many other good stories.	misy tantara tsara maro hafa koa ao
Everything is normal.	ny zavadrehetra dia mahazatra
So there must be something wrong with them.	noho izany dia tsy maintsy misy zavatra tsy mety aminizy ireo
Not only that.	tsy izy ihany
I still love them.	mbola tiako izy ireo
He just can't walk.	tsy afaka mandeha fotsiny izy
It seems very clear now.	toa mazava be izao
Doing good things does a lot of things.	ny manao zavatra tsara dia manao zavatra betsaka
They can, too.	mety koa izy ireo
He seemed confused that he could go.	toa very hevitra izy fa afaka nandeha
Made these alone.	nanao ireo irery
And of course it all works really well.	ary mazava ho azy fa miasa tsara tokoa izany rehetra izany
But they are not like others.	tsy toy ny hafa anefa izy ireo
It can be a wonderful life.	mety ho fiainana nahafinaritra izany
I am so full of you.	tena feno anao aho
Goes with this picture though.	mandeha aminity sary ity na izany aza
And then there were these people.	ary avy eo dia nisy ireo olona ireo
Not from men or women.	tsy avy aminny lehilahy na aminny vehivavy
What a wonderful day.	tena andro mahafinaritra
I want him there.	tiako ho any izy
Past life.	fiainana lasa izay
It doesn’t make much sense either.	tsy dia misy dikany koa
Whichever way he likes you.	na inona na inona fomba tiany anao
It could be wrong again.	mety ho diso indray
I know this is bad.	fantatro fa ratsy izany
The fact that this is true, however, is not the idea.	ny hoe marina anefa izany dia tsy ny hevitra
Very good news.	vaovao mahafinaritra tokoa
They had to go fast.	tsy maintsy nandeha haingana izy ireo
Every man is free.	afaka ny lehilahy tsirairay
So, no pictures.	noho izany tsy misy sary
Of course, there are many more.	mazava ho azy fa misy maro hafa
And for two reasons.	ary noho ny antony roa
I would like one.	mila iray aho
The problem is this.	ny olana dia ity ihany
The story is too complicated.	sarotra loatra ny tantara
And he will never do that.	ary tsy hanao izany mihitsy izy
But he had nothing.	tsy nisy na inona na inona taminy anefa
It doesn’t matter, they say.	tsy zavadehibe hoy izy ireo
The place was very important to him.	tena zavadehibe taminy ny toerana
Especially in that world.	indrindra fa aminizany tontolo izany
There were also two of them.	nisy roa koa izy ireo
However, there is something special about the latter.	na izany aza misy zavatra manokana momba ity farany
Right now he can’t.	aminizao fotoana izao dia tsy afaka izy
He was then there.	teo izy avy eo
Now, they are free.	ankehitriny afaka izy ireo
So for sure all the other reasons.	ka azo antoka fa ny antony hafa rehetra
But it didn’t make much sense.	saingy tsy nisy dikany loatra izany
They looked at the pictures.	nijery ireo sary izy ireo
Just three simple steps.	dingana tsotra telo ihany
He was the most handsome man.	izy no lehilahy tsara tarehy indrindra
You are here now.	eto ianao izao
It is a home for people.	trano ho anny olona io
And it will happen this year.	ary ho tanteraka aminity taona ity izany
They need us there.	mila antsika any izy ireo
This is almost impossible today.	saika tsy azo atao izany aminizao andro izao
I’m not always like that.	tsy toy izany foana aho
Or it may not be a problem.	na mety tsy olana izany
We exist and we do not exist together.	misy isika ary tsy misy miaraka
You will love it here.	ho tianao eto
And you are coming now.	ary ho avy ianao izao
Once and for all.	indray mandeha ary ho anny rehetra
I know he will come to you.	fantatro fa ho avy aminao izy
We do not have the same place.	tsy manana toerana mitovy isika
It has a high top.	manana ambony ambony
You are a normal man.	lehilahy mahazatra ianao
There was nothing like it.	tsy nisy toa azy
It shouldn’t have done that.	tsy tokony nanao izany
Problems between you and me too.	olana eo amiko sy ianao koa
Then there are others.	dia misy ny hafa
He had nothing then.	tsy nanana na inona na inona izy taminizany
I never thought he was.	tsy nieritreritra mihitsy aho hoe izy
If he is bad.	raha ratsy izy
Just look at him maybe.	jereo fotsiny angamba izy
We were far away then.	lavitra izahay taminizany
I don’t know, and neither do you.	tsy fantatro ary ianao koa
When he really didn’t.	rehefa tena tsy nanao izany izy
And it goes too fast.	ary mandeha haingana loatra
It’s all really crazy.	tena adala daholo
General ideas only.	hevitra ankapobeny ihany
I think it's good and very easy !!.	heveriko fa tsara ary tena mora
You got money.	nahazo vola ianao
The problem is more specific.	ny olana dia manokana kokoa
You are far from him.	lavitra azy ianao
And some don’t.	ary ny sasany tsy
They had us.	nanana antsika izy ireo
And everything is so beautiful.	ary ny zavadrehetra dia tena tsara tarehy
They may come.	mety ho tonga izy ireo
But you deserve more.	saingy mendrika kokoa ianao
Better than the first two.	tsara kokoa noho ny roa voalohany
I think that’s really fun.	heveriko fa tena mahafinaritra izany
That is exactly the situation here.	izany indrindra no zavamisy eto
But work is still work.	fa ny asa dia mbola asa
Very clear.	tena mazava
It just can’t.	tsy afaka izany fotsiny
Everything came easily to him.	tonga mora taminy ny zavadrehetra
Not at all, of course.	tsy aminny zavadrehetra mazava ho azy
So you get this story.	ka azonao ity tantara ity
Everything works fine but only one thing.	miasa tsara daholo ny zavadrehetra fa zavatra iray ihany
They both have their potential.	samy manana ny mety ho izy ireo
And it’s not very common.	ary tsy tena mahazatra
And very close.	ary tena akaiky
A lot, though.	betsaka na dia
Both said no.	samy nilaza fa tsia
If it works, it will be better.	raha miasa izany dia ho tsara kokoa
They are not like words.	tsy toy ny teny izy ireo
It was a wonderful day for all of us.	andro nahafinaritra ho antsika rehetra izany
At first, it is sure to be difficult.	aminny voalohany dia azo antoka fa ho sarotra izany
I love seeing it all.	tiako ny mahita izany rehetra izany
However, he knows the way well.	na izany aza fantany tsara ny lalana
But now it is too difficult.	sarotra loatra anefa izany ankehitriny
There is nothing there.	tsy misy na inona na inona any
Of course, that doesn't mean anything to you.	mazava ho azy fa tsy misy dikany aminao akory izany
Thank you, one and all !.	misaotra anao iray sy rehetra
But that is not all.	tsy izay ihany anefa izany
You can easily find it.	afaka mahita mora foana ianao
People are dying in this war.	maty aminity ady ity ny olona
Not right now.	tsy aminizao fotoana izao izany
I love going places.	tiako ny mandeha toerana
We should not go too far.	tsy tokony ho lasa lavitra isika
I have more than that.	manana mihoatra noho izany aho
It is not even possible to hope.	tsy azo atao na dia ny manantena
You are already on your way.	efa mandeha ianao
I’m so glad we did.	tena faly aho fa nanao izany izahay
Lots of food, but worth it.	be dia be ny sakafo fa mendrika izany
They are too close.	akaiky loatra izy ireo
Not wrong, not wrong, but bad.	tsy diso tsy diso fa ratsy
I became such a person.	lasa olona toy izany aho
So, if nothing else.	noho izany raha tsy misy zavatra hafa
However, this is not very important.	na izany aza tsy dia zavadehibe loatra izany
It is.	izy io dia
I don't want to be in this new world.	tsy te ho any aminity tontolo vaovao ity aho
The money from the house.	ny vola avy aminny trano
It was a wonderful day for me.	andro nahafinaritra ahy izany
Still free.	mbola afaka
He should be different, be more.	tokony ho hafa izy ho bebe kokoa
Then we came.	dia tonga izahay
We should not be there.	tsy tokony ho eo isika
It came to them.	tonga teo aminizy ireo izany
Thanks for all the good ideas.	misaotra aminny hevitra tsara rehetra
They love us.	tia antsika izy ireo
May it be good again.	mba mety ho tsara indray
I’ve been thinking about it for a long time.	efa nieritreritra ela be momba izany aho
So the result is from.	noho izany ny vokatra dia avy aminny
But, it’s a lot of fun.	saingy mahafinaritra be izany
And then if you’re older.	ary avy eo raha lehibe ianao
It seems more fun.	toa mahafinaritra kokoa izany
Of course, there is a reason for everything.	marina fa misy antony ny zavadrehetra
And maybe it’s not you.	ary angamba tsy anao izany
He has always known.	efa fantany foana
If you like it, you might like it.	raha tianao izany dia mety ho tianao izany
It won’t be fast and it won’t be easy.	tsy ho haingana izany ary tsy ho mora
Too close, though.	akaiky loatra na izany aza
That’s what they deserve.	izany no mendrika azy ireo
Same as two years ago.	mitovy aminny roa taona lasa
Although he did not at first.	na dia tsy nanao izany aza izy taminny voalohany
They can’t be real and they aren’t.	tsy mety ho tena izy ireo ary tsy izy ireo
I know too much.	fantatro loatra
The results are as follows.	manaraka izao ny vokatra
I think that’s just the way it is.	heveriko fa tena toy izany ny fomba
But I love yours.	tiako anefa ny anao
The days are yet to come.	mbola ho avy ny andro ho avy
First, it is very easy.	voalohany dia tena mora
But a lot.	fa betsaka
He is almost the same age as me.	saika mitovy taona amiko izy
You should be able to do it once.	tokony ho afaka hanao izany indray mandeha
I don't need them.	tsy mila azy ireo aho
And there I was.	ary teo aho
And neither will he.	ary tsy hanao izany koa izy
And you can't die.	ary tsy mety maty ianao
They are not selfish.	tsy tia tena izy ireo
Just look at where you are.	jereo fotsiny ny toerana misy anao
It was not in the food.	tsy tao aminny sakafo izany
Special, for everyone.	manokana ho anny rehetra
I looked at him and he looked at me again.	nijery azy aho ary nijery ahy indray izy
And he could think.	ary afaka nieritreritra izy
The world needs it.	mila izany izao tontolo izao
Do these things.	ataovy ireo zavatra ireo
I haven’t gone to one yet.	mbola tsy nandeha na dia iray akory aza aho
And both have good and bad.	ary samy manana ny tsara sy ny ratsy
You won’t like this one either.	tsy ho tianao koa ity iray ity
There should never be.	tsy tokony hisy mihitsy
I couldn’t think for long.	tsy afaka nieritreritra ela aho
This could be completely wrong.	mety ho diso tanteraka izany
It’s selfish.	tia tena izany
Too much for general reasons.	be loatra aminny antony ankapobeny
I know you're down.	fantatro fa ao ambany ianao
Nothing came even close.	tsy nisy na inona na inona tonga na dia akaiky aza
He does a beautiful job and a difficult part.	manao asa tsara tarehy izy ary ampahany sarotra
There are many stories about it.	misy tantara maro momba izany
Of course he was wrong.	mazava ho azy fa diso izy
It was hard to do.	sarotra ny nanao izany
But now, perhaps, there was another option.	saingy ankehitriny angamba nisy safidy hafa
Yes, good for you.	eny tsara ho anao
Sometimes, however, we don’t see it.	indraindray anefa dia tsy mahita izany isika
But it came to him.	saingy tonga tao aminy izany
Anyway, fun.	na izany na tsy izany mahafinaritra
Either way, it’s not personal.	na izany na tsy izany dia tsy anny tena manokana izany
I came here for a reason, and one alone.	tonga eto aho noho ny antony iray ary iray irery
There was no other good story.	tsy nisy tantara tsara hafa
So we both get something out of it.	ka samy mahazo zavatra avy aminizany izahay
These are not found.	tsy hita ireo
In the end, it will be a good thing.	aminny farany dia ho zavatra tsara izany
It also works regularly.	miasa matetika koa izy io
Just different.	hafa ihany
There are clear and bad choices.	misy safidy mazava tsara sy ratsy
Everything is simple.	ny zavatra tsotra rehetra
Of course, they never did.	mazava ho azy fa tsy nanao izany mihitsy izy ireo
Or just not on the ground.	na tsy aminny tany fotsiny
You probably know what works for you.	fantatrao angamba hoe inona no mety aminao
The same goes for two of the others.	toy izany koa ny roa aminireo hafa
Just a little work here, that’s all.	asa kely fotsiny eto dia izay ihany
No photos.	tsy misy sary
It seems so simple to me.	toa tsotra be izany amiko
Then everything is lost.	very ny zavadrehetra avy eo
Past actions are important.	zavadehibe ny hetsika taloha
Today is enough.	anio dia ampy izay
There is a process.	misy dingana
Yes, you can find it everywhere.	eny afaka mahita azy eny rehetra eny ianao
And he came.	ary tonga izy
I just looked.	nijery fotsiny aho
I had to do something.	tsy maintsy nanao zavatra aho
I always love doing things like this.	tiako foana ny manao zavatra toy izao
This is great news.	vaovao lehibe izany
This is a crazy time.	fotoana adala izao
Take a good look at the idea.	jereo tsara ny hevitra
But there are many others.	saingy misy hafa be dia be
They were real, both of them.	tena nisy izy ireo izy roa
This is generally just nonsense.	izany dia aminny ankapobeny dia tsy misy dikany fotsiny
These words are mine now.	ahy izao ireo teny ireo
I know very well that it is not easy.	fantatro tsara fa tsy mora izany
However, some of them are similar.	na izany aza ny sasany aminizy ireo dia mitovy
But all of that is too much.	be loatra anefa izany rehetra izany
Someone might have told him to be far away.	mety ho nisy olona nilaza azy ho lavitra
Better when he isn’t.	tsara kokoa rehefa tsy izy
But they could have done it differently.	afaka nanao izany taminny fomba hafa anefa izy ireo
It dies easily.	maty mora izany
I’ve always thought about this thing.	efa nieritreritra anio zavatra io foana aho
There is another way, a better way.	misy fomba hafa fomba tsara kokoa
Now the truth has come.	tonga izao ny marina
For women, it is different.	aminny vehivavy dia hafa izany
It can't be removed.	tsy afaka ilay izy
It was a great game for us.	lalao lehibe ho anay izany
Almost immediately.	saika avy hatrany
They are not of the world.	tsy izao tontolo izao izy ireo
We’re really working on that.	tena miasa aminizany izahay
Sometimes it’s just because.	indraindray dia satria fotsiny
But even then it was gone.	saingy na izany aza dia lasa azy
Don’t do it for trivial reasons.	aza manao izany noho ny antony tsy misy dikany
People like us don't get jobs.	tsy mahazo asa ny olona toa antsika
We needed it so well.	nila izany izahay ka tsara
I had one.	nanana iray aho
Sometimes these are not the same.	indraindray ireo dia tsy mitovy
We certainly did not harm them.	azo antoka fa tsy nanao ratsy azy ireo izahay
He seems to know everything.	toa fantany ny zavadrehetra
Even he, even now.	na izy aza na dia izao aza
Good or bad, just do it.	na tsara na ratsy ataovy fotsiny
But the house.	fa ny trano
He’s too big for that.	lehibe loatra izy noho izany
They did the same.	nanao izany koa izy ireo
Don't love me.	aza tia ahy
It all works first.	izany rehetra izany dia miasa voalohany
They really needed him.	tena nila azy izy ireo
Even if it doesn’t go well.	na dia tsy mandeha tsara aza izany
No one should do it alone.	tsy misy olona tokony hanao izany irery
They could be you too.	mety ho anao koa izy ireo
Speed ​​is the most important thing.	ny haingana no zavadehibe indrindra
Doing very well.	manao tena tsara
And soon.	ary tsy ela
Indeed, some have gone even further.	eny tokoa ny sasany dia lasa lavitra kokoa
Everyone deserves it.	mendrika ny tsirairay
But the story is good.	saingy tsara ny tantara
He had to be sure.	tsy maintsy nahazo antoka izy
And it will come to pass.	ary ho tanteraka izany
And we drove two cars.	ary nandeha fiara roa izahay
This is not a problem for them.	tsy olana ho azy ireo izany
He had a great idea about you.	nanana hevitra ambony momba anao izy
But it was still a happy time.	mbola fotoana nahafinaritra ihany anefa izany
People said it didn’t happen.	nilaza ny olona fa tsy nisy izany
Yes, it is nothing.	eny tsy inona izany
Don’t look too closely.	aza mijery akaiky
Not everyone has all the information.	tsy ny rehetra no manana ny vaovao rehetra
This is very easy to do.	tena mora azo atao izany
You can find these for yourself.	afaka mahita ireo ho anao ianao
We may be wrong.	mety ho diso hevitra isika
I never looked at him.	tsy mba nijery azy mihitsy
Yes, it would be better.	eny ho tsara kokoa izany
They are not always.	tsy foana izy ireo
However, it is not simple.	na izany aza dia tsy tsotra
Nice place, nice house.	toerana mahafinaritra trano mahafinaritra
People lost homes and jobs.	very trano sy asa ny olona
He never thought it was bad.	tsy nieritreritra mihitsy izy hoe ratsy
Now I see why.	ankehitriny dia hitako ny antony
This is not the right place.	tsy io no toerana mety
There is another way it might work.	misy fomba iray hafa mety miasa
Maybe not, but it’s real.	mety tsy izany fa ny tena izy
Often low, sometimes high.	matetika ambany indraindray ambony
There is no easy way.	tsy misy fomba mora
And everything went too fast.	ary nandeha haingana loatra ny zavadrehetra
They are already watching.	efa mijery izy ireo
I don't work nights.	tsy miasa alina aho
Yes, that’s not too much.	eny tsy dia maro loatra izany
But you know very well.	fa fantatrao tsara
One of his favorites.	iray aminireo tiany
They are not all bad.	tsy ratsy daholo izy ireo
So they are the same.	noho izany dia mitovy izy ireo
It’s so easy, so simple.	tena mora izany tena tsotra
It is not of this world.	tsy avy aminity tany ity izany
Yes, it’s important, he said.	eny zavadehibe izany hoy izy
Whether it is there or not.	na eo io na tsy misy
And now, here we are again.	ary ankehitriny eto indray isika
He would never like them.	tsy ho tiany mihitsy ireo
So it is necessary to start now.	noho izany dia ilaina ny manomboka izao
Here is a beautiful picture.	ity misy sary tsara tarehy
I don’t want to do something like that.	tsy te hanao zavatra toy izany aho
I immediately got into similar problems.	avy hatrany dia nahazo olana toy izany
And very little about future products.	ary kely dia kely momba ny vokatra ho avy
I should have had a job.	tokony nanana asa aho
Not so clear, not right.	tsy mazava loatra tsy mety
I'm so glad to see you again.	tena faly aho mahita anao indray
But he finally came.	saingy tonga ihany izy taminny farany
Higher history.	tantara ambony kokoa
You can do it well.	azonao atao tsara izany
It was pretty fun, yeah.	somary nahafinaritra izany eny
We are exactly the same.	mitovy tanteraka isika
You can start.	afaka manomboka ianao
Clearly, this is possible.	mazava anefa fa azo atao izany
But they do, over and over again.	saingy manao izany izy ireo hatrany hatrany hatrany
He makes everything beautiful.	izy no manao ny zavadrehetra ho tsara tarehy
It was nice to see them so happy.	nahafinaritra ny nahita azy ireo faly be
It starts on day one.	manomboka aminny andro iray izany
This can be done easily.	azo atao mora foana izany
To do what is right, is not clear.	ny hanao inona marina tsy mazava
You are one of me.	iray aminny ahy ianao
It’s easy and good.	mora sy tsara izany
Then he paused.	dia nijanona kely izy
I love you, woman.	tiako ianao vehivavy
No work started.	tsy nisy asa nanomboka
Of course, in fact.	mazava ho azy raha ny marina
And then he has to do it himself.	ary avy eo dia tsy maintsy manao izany ny tenany
For me, it was the end.	ho ahy dia farany izany
We must follow it.	tsy maintsy manaraka izany isika
This is the highest.	io no ambony indrindra
But then he liked it.	saingy avy eo dia tiany izany
I want to do something for you.	te hanao zavatra ho anao aho
You like it too.	tianao koa izany
It will be a good fight.	ho ady tsara izany
No problem either.	tsy misy olana koa
But that is not an viable option.	saingy tsy safidy azo natao izany
Everyone you love may not love you very much.	ny olona rehetra tianao dia mety tsy dia tia anao loatra
The same ones.	ireo ihany
So, this is where we are.	noho izany izany no toerana misy antsika
I know that sometimes it’s just really bad.	fantatro fa indraindray dia tena ratsy tokoa izany
But that is a good thing.	zavatra tsara anefa izany
The news works.	miasa ny vaovao
They look more.	mijery bebe kokoa izy ireo
I would be lost without you.	ho very aho raha tsy misy anao
But he doesn't want to be here.	tsy te ho eto anefa izy
He then looked at me in a confused way.	nijery ahy taminny fomba very hevitra izy avy eo
There was no end.	tsy nisy farany
Which is really bad news for all of us.	izay tena vaovao ratsy ho antsika rehetra
To me, it has to be.	amiko dia tsy maintsy izany
We really have to do something.	tena tokony hanao zavatra isika
But nothing like that happened.	tsy nisy toy izany anefa teo
There was something he didn't like about it.	nisy zavatra tsy tiany taminizany
And it’s really hard for us.	ary tena sarotra ho anay izany
Because it’s the same.	satria mitovy ihany
This is not a first step.	tsy dingana voalohany izany
But still a good job overall !.	saingy mbola asa tsara aminny ankapobeny
Or, in fact, because of them.	na raha ny marina noho izy ireo
This is a clear fact.	zavamisy mazava izany
Maybe he didn’t tell the truth about it.	angamba tsy nilaza ny marina momba izany izy
This place was nothing like that.	tsy nisy toy izany ity toerana ity
It doesn’t need much space.	tsy mila toerana be
Here we are again, already.	eto indray isika efa
I was so happy for him for no reason.	tena faly ho azy aho tsy nisy antony
The biggest is the location.	ny lehibe indrindra dia ny toerana
Many men died then.	be dia be ny lehilahy maty taminizany
The real me.	ny tena ahy
Because of a woman.	noho ny vehivavy iray
He always looked at her.	nijery azy foana izy
He is so much better than that.	tsara lavitra noho izany izy
Everything is fun.	faly ny zavatra rehetra
First of all, beautiful.	voalohany indrindra tsara tarehy
But he knew she was the woman for him.	fantany anefa fa io no vehivavy ho azy
They did not stay in one place.	tsy nijanona teo aminny toerana iray izy ireo
We are wasting time.	very fotoana isika
With all that.	miaraka aminizany rehetra izany
I will do work for you.	hanao asa ho anao aho
They came and got us all.	tonga izy ireo ary nahazo anay rehetra
It should be good news.	tokony ho vaovao tsara izy io
When there wasn’t a good trip.	rehefa tsy nisy dia tsara
I have never seen anything like it.	mbola tsy nahita zavatra toy izao aho
It cannot be said to be real.	tsy azo atao ny hoe tena izy io
They will all be safer now.	ho azo antoka kokoa izy rehetra izao
Then they left.	avy eo dia lasa izy ireo
But it will be difficult.	ho sarotra anefa izany
But that's exactly what he didn't like.	izany indrindra anefa no tsy tiany
You can do really fun things.	afaka manao zavatra tena mahafinaritra ianao
And it could be one as well.	ary mety ho iray ihany koa
Still kind of do it sometimes.	mbola karazana manao izany indraindray
Or too close to make sense.	na akaiky loatra ka tsy misy dikany
He seemed completely confused.	toa very hevitra tanteraka izy
It might work too.	mety miasa koa izany
We couldn't stay there anymore.	tsy afaka nijanona teo intsony izahay
There was nothing lacking in them.	tsy nisy tsy ampy azy ireo
You have two of them.	manana roa aminizy ireo ianao
It doesn’t happen automatically.	tsy mandeha ho azy izany
But it has to be.	saingy tsy maintsy izany no izy
But now it is needed.	tena ilaina anefa izy izao
But for you.	fa ho anao
After some thought about it, it made more sense.	rehefa avy nieritreritra izany ny sasany dia nisy dikany kokoa izany
Now, too.	izao koa
They do it because there is no work better than mine.	manao izany izy ireo satria tsy misy asa mihoatra ahy
Then we will do it all again.	dia hanao izany rehetra izany indray isika
They are all there, too.	izy rehetra koa dia misy
However, we still had a great time.	na izany aza mbola nanana fotoana mahafinaritra izahay
But only one is worth it.	fa ny iray mendrika ihany
If you’re not happy, we’re not happy.	raha tsy faly ianao dia tsy faly izahay
I really enjoyed this story.	tena nahafinaritra ahy ity tantara ity
It would seem like it never existed.	ho toy ny tsy teo mihitsy izany
I don’t know these types.	tsy fantatro ireo karazana ireo
I thought of him.	nieritreritra azy aho
For some reason, it always gets to me.	noho ny antony sasany dia mahazo ahy foana izany
We already have it.	efa manana izany isika
That’s all they’re used to.	izay ihany no mahazatra azy ireo
Of course we have it.	mazava ho azy fa manana izany
There should be no debate.	tsy tokony hisy ady hevitra akory
You can be beautiful.	mety ho tsara tarehy ianao
You can go see it if you like.	afaka mandeha mijery azy ianao raha tianao
She is the woman for me.	izy no vehivavy ho ahy
But that could be wrong.	saingy mety ho diso izany
Crazy people.	olona adala
And maybe we should.	ary angamba tokony ho isika
In that case.	aminizany
One night you know it all.	indray alina dia fantatrao daholo izany
He got the picture.	nahazo ilay sary izy
And there always was.	ary nisy foana
This is the real question.	io no tena fanontaniana
I may have seen this before.	mety efa nahita anio mihitsy aho taloha
But it’s not mine anymore.	fa tsy ahy intsony izany
Because we have a problem.	satria manana olana isika
I don’t want to be known.	tsy tiako ho fantany aho
We have a job right now.	manana asa iray isika aminizao fotoana izao
This is my favorite of the two.	ity no tena tiako indrindra aminizy roa
That is no longer enough.	tsy ampy intsony izany
Good woman.	vehivavy tsara
The time and place are perfect.	mety tsara ny fotoana sy ny toerana
You don’t know what to do.	tsy fantatrao hoe inona no atao
It’s different to do things with him.	hafa ny manao zavatra aminy
Only about him is right.	ny momba azy ihany no mety
He didn’t do it often, not anymore.	tsy nanao izany matetika izy tsy izany intsony
But the facts are certain.	azo antoka anefa ny zavamisy
I have a problem.	manana olana iray aho
They were too fast for me.	haingana loatra tamiko izy ireo
Yes, you are about to come.	eny saika ho tonga ianao
What, then.	inona no dia
There is work.	misy ny asa
They are hard on money.	sarotra aminny vola izy ireo
But it’s not a game.	saingy tsy lalao izany
Not from this.	tsy avy aminity
All fast food should be like that.	ny sakafo haingana rehetra dia tokony ho toy izany
It's fun there.	mahafinaritra any
I didn't find any other option.	tsy nahita safidy hafa
Truth is not needed.	tsy ilaina ny marina
But not so.	tsy toy izany anefa
Women are not like that.	tsy toy izany ny vehivavy
Finally no top.	farany tsy misy ambony
It was hard to walk.	sarotra ny nandeha
It does well.	manao tsara izany
What a place it is.	toerana inona izany
That’s the best thing ever.	izany no tena zavatra tsara indrindra
Please do the right thing.	mba ataovy ny tsara
But such things are not uncommon.	fa ny zavatra toy izany dia tsy dia matetika
He looks like a handsome man.	toa lehilahy tsara tarehy
This year could be one of the worst.	ity taona ity dia mety ho iray aminireo ratsy indrindra
There is something to come from that.	misy zavatra ho avy aminizany
This method is simple.	tsotra io fomba io
We have a problem.	manana olana isika
They are very fast and clear.	tena haingana sy mazava tsara izy ireo
Too much and not worth it.	be loatra ka tsy mendrika izany
Never lose these.	aza very mihitsy ireo
And not just for men.	ary tsy ho anny lehilahy ihany
Now you know that.	ankehitriny fantatrao izany
He left immediately.	nandeha avy hatrany izy
I got good news for you.	nahazo vaovao tsara ho anao aho
He sees others.	mahita hafa izy
This is what it means to work.	toy izao no atao hoe miasa
I think it’s much more than that.	heveriko fa mihoatra lavitra noho izany izany
And many more.	ary mbola betsaka kokoa
He looked at everyone, then left.	nijery ny rehetra izy dia lasa
No idea had come to him yet.	mbola tsy nisy hevitra tonga tao aminy
All of this seems possible.	toa azo atao izany rehetra izany
News also often has money.	ny vaovao ihany koa dia matetika manana vola
In fact, this is not really true.	raha ny marina dia tsy tena marina izany
All of them and they are very happy.	ny azy rehetra ary tena faly izy ireo
But it will be too fast.	fa ho haingana loatra izany
You could be a person.	mety ho olona ianao
I had a house.	nanana trano aho
I went for it now.	nandeha taminizany aho izao
There is good news here.	misy vaovao tsara eto
He deserves the best.	mendrika ny tsara indrindra izy
In fact, it is not very necessary.	raha ny marina tsy dia ilaina loatra
There must be something else to come.	tsy maintsy hisy zavatra hafa ho avy
It will still be difficult.	mbola ho sarotra izany
They seemed too small for him.	toa kely loatra taminy ireo
Now, that seems pointless, a bit silly.	ankehitriny toa tsy misy dikany izany somary adala
The question was meaningless.	tsy nisy dikany ilay fanontaniana
It was a very difficult year for me.	tena taona sarotra tamiko izany
He knows he owns the house.	fantany fa manana ny trano izy
Soon there will be more money.	tsy ho ela dia hisy vola bebe kokoa
Not like these.	tsy toy ireo
But he may have died.	mety ho efa maty anefa izy
I hope everyone.	manantena ny rehetra aho
But that is not the case here.	tsy toy izany anefa ny zavamisy eto
We have been making that choice for a long time.	efa ela no nanao izany safidy izany izahay
It’s a tough place.	toerana mafy izany
Even if it’s already familiar and familiar.	na dia efa mahazatra sy mahazatra aza
It is meant for one and for all.	natao ho anny iray ary ho anny rehetra izany
Very clear in the picture.	mazava tsara aminny sary
You are the best man at work.	ianao no lehilahy tsara indrindra aminny asa
I made a lot of money.	nahazo vola be aho
This is certainly not true of me.	azo antoka fa tsy marina izany amiko
We have to start all over again.	tsy maintsy manomboka indray isika
But nothing special.	saingy tsy misy zavatra manokana
When they have you, they have you.	rehefa manana anao izy ireo dia manana anao
Then you say yes.	dia hoy ianao hoe eny
But we are all different.	samy hafa anefa isika rehetra
One night it was really bad.	indray alina dia tena ratsy
It’s not like he always loves her.	tsy toy ny hoe tia azy foana izy
Either way.	na izany na tsia
Important, if true.	zavadehibe raha marina
We all have where to go and what to do.	samy manana ny toerana tokony hisy azy sy ny zavatra atao isika rehetra
Then it is for you.	dia ho anao izany
Of course, too little.	mazava ho azy fa kely loatra
I just love him no matter what.	tiako fotsiny izy na inona na inona
I was crazy not to think of that.	adala aho tsy nieritreritra anio
This is the biggest problem.	izany no olana lehibe indrindra
And it’s a story, too.	ary misy tantara koa izany
But don't make it a big story.	aza atao tantara lehibe anefa izany
I know very little about him.	kely kely ny zavatra fantatro momba azy
But it may be worth it.	mety ho mendrika izany anefa
She loves him, wants to do it.	tia azy izy te hanao izany
That’s the simple part.	izany no ampahany tsotra
I wouldn’t have known that.	tsy ho fantatro izany
But it was also fun.	nahafinaritra koa anefa izany
Also, worse.	ary koa ratsy kokoa
These are the people.	ireo no olona
But many loved him.	maro anefa no tia azy
They were wrong then, and they are wrong now.	diso izy ireo taminizany ary diso izy ireo ankehitriny
Look at this, he said.	jereo ity hoy izy
It is far from them.	lavitra azy ireo izany
There were a lot of them.	nisy be dia be
It’s just crazy.	tsotra adala izany
Some may be faster than others.	mety ho haingana kokoa noho ny hafa ny sasany
You have to know that this is hard for me.	tsy maintsy fantatrao hoe sarotra amiko izany
They started it, but stopped again.	nanomboka izany izy ireo saingy nijanona indray
He immediately started walking fast down the road.	avy hatrany izy dia nanomboka nandeha haingana taminny lalana
I think he did better, actually.	heveriko fa nanao tsara kokoa izy raha ny marina
I like the idea better than anything.	tiako ny hevitra tsara kokoa noho ny zavatra rehetra
But look carefully.	fa jereo tsara
The other thing.	ny zavatra hafa
Very difficult.	tena sarotra
This is new.	ity dia vaovao
It’s not one person but many.	tsy olona iray izany fa maro
It’s not the same as work.	tsy mitovy aminny asa
I don't see what's coming.	tsy hitako izay tonga
Not much to talk about.	tsy be resaka
Maybe they have an idea.	angamba manana hevitra izy ireo
So two questions here.	noho izany fanontaniana roa eto
Yes, it is impossible.	eny tsy azo atao mihitsy izy
It's just a part of life.	ampahany fotsiny taminny fiainana izany
This world is so good.	tena tsara tokoa ity tontolo ity
I don’t know, actually.	tsy fantatro raha ny marina
It seems like the last days.	toa andro farany izany
Then he went himself.	dia nandeha ny tenany
There, it’s a good person.	any olona tsara izany
For him, it didn’t really matter.	ho azy dia tsy dia zavadehibe loatra izany
He didn't want to be seen.	tsy te ho hita izy
I can always hope.	afaka manantena foana aho
One of these ideas is self.	ny iray aminireo hevitra ireo dia ny tena
Life again.	ny fiainana indray
And it does nothing.	ary tsy manao na inona na inona
But the other one is also good.	fa tsara koa ny iray hafa
And they all came.	dia tonga izy rehetra
Yes, they will.	eny hanao izany izy ireo
This place is, as always, very nice.	ity toerana ity dia toy ny mahazatra tena tsara
It has a good fit.	manana mety tsara
But he could not tell her that.	tsy afaka nilaza izany taminy anefa izy
We will be soon.	tsy ho ela isika
And at that time, the world was far away.	ary taminizany fotoana izany izao tontolo izao lavitra
If he had one last idea about us.	raha nanana hevitra farany momba antsika izy
Happy for him.	faly ho azy
I can't work well.	tsy afaka miasa tsara aho
It's not that hard.	tsy hoe mafy loatra ilay izy
ten thousand or not.	iray alina na tsia
I’ve always thought about that.	efa nieritreritra izany foana aho
But it seemed real.	toa tena nisy anefa izany
Or, more accurately.	na mety kokoa
This man loves you.	ity lehilahy tia anao ity
It could be one or all of them.	mety ho iray na izy rehetra
Then it is for him.	dia ho azy izy
Some are fun.	mahafinaritra ny sasany
The only way I could find it.	ny lalana ihany no hitako
The product really has a place.	ny vokatra dia tena misy toerana
This can be done quickly and easily.	azo atao haingana sy mora izany
This is not new to him.	tsy vaovao aminy izany
I think that’s pretty clear now.	heveriko fa mazava tsara izany ankehitriny
Of course, he makes himself for her.	mazava ho azy fa manao ny tenany ho azy izy
But you never know.	tsy fantatrao mihitsy anefa
But he must be right.	tsy maintsy marina anefa izy
She immediately fell in love with him.	tonga dia tia azy izy
I know everyone around here.	fantatro ny olona rehetra manodidina eto
I need more than that too.	mila mihoatra noho izany koa aho
Then you should know what it is.	dia tokony ho fantatrao hoe inona ilay izy
One of those years maybe.	iray aminireo taona ireo angamba
If I just do wrong, it works.	raha manao ratsy fotsiny aho dia miasa
It is also very true.	tena marina koa izy io
No one mentioned any other problems.	tsy nisy nilaza olana hafa
Maybe it suits me.	mety amiko angamba
There was nothing about him.	tsy nisy na inona na inona momba azy
It becomes difficult quickly.	lasa sarotra haingana
The world was fun.	nahafinaritra ny tontolo
That is, the part may be yours.	izany hoe mety ho anao ny ampahany
But women are better.	fa tsara kokoa ny vehivavy
My first favorite.	ny tiako voalohany
What is real.	inona no tena izy
Women then.	vehivavy avy eo
This product is also good.	ity vokatra ity dia tsara ihany koa
Maybe he doesn’t have such a choice.	angamba tsy manana safidy toy izany izy
But of course, these reasons are not enough for them.	saingy mazava ho azy fa tsy ampy ho azy ireo ireo antony ireo
It’s easy to see the problem here.	mora ny mahita ny olana eto
That's what he doesn't like.	izay no tsy tiany
Said it wasn't enough.	nilaza fa tsy ampy loatra
Apparently they don’t.	hita fa tsy manao izany izy ireo
There may be yours too.	mety misy koa ny anao
I know I deserve it.	fantatro fa mendrika izany aho
The right is right, the wrong is wrong.	ny marina no marina ny ratsy no diso
But he was a good man.	lehilahy tsara anefa izy
All very good questions.	fanontaniana tena tsara daholo
Then do it all over again.	dia ataovy indray izany rehetra izany
But it is too early.	izany anefa aloha loatra
The one who came earlier.	ilay tonga teo aloha
Some want to make the food.	ny sasany te hanao ny sakafo
It never happened again.	tsy nisy toy izany intsony
Only what is needed.	izay ilaina ihany
Special time, he said.	fotoana manokana hoy izy
This is the easiest question.	io no fanontaniana mora indrindra
You cannot have the good without the bad.	tsy afaka manana ny tsara ianao raha tsy misy ny ratsy
But he is still there.	mbola ao ihany anefa izy
I love it and it’s fun.	tiako ilay izy ary mahafinaritra
Not good without it.	tsy mety raha tsy misy izany
No one could have.	tsy nisy afaka nanana
He just wanted to be something.	te ho zavatra fotsiny izy
He knew this very well.	fantany mazava tsara izany
Make sure you do it today.	ataovy azo antoka fa manao izany ianao anio
Then it stopped.	dia nijanona
No, not with the same thing.	tsia tsy miaraka aminny zavatra mitovy
Now, that’s a little more.	ankehitriny kely kokoa izany
But there was.	fa nisy teo
He said he got two.	nilaza izy fa nahazo roa
In fact, he was a good man.	raha ny marina lehilahy tsara izy
There was no one with him.	tsy nisy olona taminy
But no one does that.	saingy tsy misy olona manao izany
It is easy to find.	mora hita ilay izy
We have all had past lives.	samy nanana fiainana lasa isika rehetra
Sometimes they can be too much.	indraindray dia mety ho be loatra izy ireo
And so should you.	ary tokony ho toy izany koa ianao
Everyone here can do it.	afaka manao izany ny olona rehetra eto
Sometimes a lot of time.	indraindray fotoana be
It was a great day.	nahafinaritra be ny andro
Really something for the future.	tena zavatra ho anny ho avy
I'll be back for a long time.	mbola ho ela aho
I'm so glad he came.	faly be aho fa tonga izy
They had me.	nanana ahy izy ireo
However, they did a good job of it.	na izany aza nanao asa tsara izy ireo taminizany
In fact, it’s not that hard to do.	raha ny marina dia tsy dia sarotra ny manao izany
And worse, he knows everything very well.	ary ratsy kokoa fantany tsara ny zavadrehetra
Easy there.	mora any
I know you have one.	fantatro fa manana iray ianao
They could do nothing but watch.	tsy afaka nanao na inona na inona izy ireo fa nijery
We totally walked the place.	nandeha tanteraka ny toerana izahay
He thought about food.	nieritreritra momba ny sakafo izy
Two more nights, it will be gone.	roa alina indray dia tsy hisy intsony izany
Don’t be stupid.	aza adala
I don’t see that very clearly at all.	tsy hitako izay mazava be mihitsy
It will always be true.	ho marina foana izany
And yet, it doesn’t seem trivial.	ary na izany aza dia tsy toy ny tsy misy dikany izany
To me it is.	amiko io
This one may not work that way.	ity iray ity dia mety tsy miasa toy izany
Some of the other things.	ny sasany aminireo zavatra hafa
I'm not for one.	tsy ho anny iray aho
You want to.	ianao dia te
It doesn’t seem good, to say the least.	toa tsy tsara izany raha ny kely indrindra
Very little is seen.	kely kely no hita
He probably already knows.	efa fantany angamba izao
Of course, they could not.	mazava ho azy fa tsy afaka nanao izany izy ireo
It’s just a good approach.	fomba tsara fotsiny izany
The action is simple.	tsotra ny hetsika
You are too important.	zavadehibe loatra ianao
He is for all of us.	antsika rehetra izy
It’s really everything.	tena zavadrehetra izany
It’s kind of hard.	sarotra ny karazana
And maybe not just them.	ary angamba tsy izy ireo ihany
It’s all a bit too much.	somary be ihany izany rehetra izany
The man is big.	lehibe ilay lehilahy
I will make a car eventually.	hanao fiara aho aminny farany
This is the easiest part.	ity no ampahany mora indrindra
Now you have to do it.	ankehitriny dia tsy maintsy manao izany ianao
And now it’s just as usual.	ary izao dia toy ny mahazatra ihany
Maybe there is.	angamba misy izany
There is no such thing.	tsy misy zavatra toy izany koa
They may have done so.	mety ho nanao izany izy ireo
But there is nothing to be seen.	saingy tsy misy na inona na inona ho hita
Not great at all.	tsy lehibe mihitsy
We also received a small amount of money.	nahazo vola kely koa izahay
Sometimes we don’t.	indraindray isika dia tsy manao izany
He has now found the truth for himself.	efa nahita ny marina ho azy izy izao
Then he went with them.	dia lasa miaraka aminizy ireo izy avy eo
No one got it right.	tsy nisy nahazo izany marina
It’s a fast game.	lalao haingana izy
So, we get the result.	noho izany mahazo ny vokatra isika
He had pictures, he had everything.	nanana sary izy nanana ny zavadrehetra
Not happy, it's not possible.	tsy faly tsy azo atao izany
They are from two different worlds.	avy aminny tontolo roa samy hafa izy ireo
In each.	aminny tsirairay
He loves what he has.	tiany izay azy
This comes from two products.	izany dia avy aminny vokatra roa
But they have come a long way.	lasa lavitra anefa izy ireo
I’m also very factual about money.	tena zavamisy momba ny vola koa aho
That’s the right thing to do.	izany no zavatra mety
I also love this picture.	tiako koa io sary io
He does good and evil.	izy no manao ny tsara sy ny ratsy
It seemed to make sense now.	toa nisy dikany izany ankehitriny
And he turned out to be wrong nonetheless.	ary hita fa diso izy na izany aza
There are two simple ways.	misy fomba tsotra roa
Maybe, he said.	angamba hoy izy
And yes, it could be.	ary eny mety ho izy
Not an easy thing to do.	tsy zavatra mora atao
It seemed like a very good life to me.	toa fiainana tsara be tamiko izany
So, nothing is lost.	noho izany tsy misy very
You become something more.	lasa zavatra bebe kokoa ianao
But that is not the real idea.	saingy tsy izany no tena hevitra
But he didn’t start doing that to me.	saingy tsy nanomboka nanao izany tamiko izy
The day did not go well.	tsy nandeha tsara ny andro
A little word.	teny kely
I know he doesn’t need me.	fantatro fa tsy mila ahy izy
Not too long ago.	tsy ela ihany
Surely many have.	azo antoka fa maro no nanao izany
About us.	ny momba antsika
We are the world.	izao tontolo izao isika
You already are.	efa ianao
It’s all very important.	tena zavadehibe daholo izany
And it was fun to do.	ary nahafinaritra ny nanao izany
He then made some moves, which is for sure.	nanao hetsika sasany izy avy eo izay azo antoka
There was nothing else like it.	tsy nisy zavatra hafa toy izany
But nothing seems to be true.	toa tsy misy marina anefa
This may not be an option for you.	mety tsy safidy ho anao izany
That’s probably a lot.	betsaka angamba izany
It's from me.	avy amiko izany
There is only one reason.	iray ihany ny antony
He still loves them a little.	mbola kely izy ireo no tiany
Maybe he has.	angamba izy manana
Not coming soon.	tsy ho avy tsy ho ela
Otherwise, everyone else is the same.	raha tsy izany dia mitovy daholo ny hafa
These essential people will not be found when they are most needed.	ireo olona tena ilaina ireo dia tsy ho hita rehefa ilaina indrindra
Now comes the harder part.	tonga izao ny ampahany sarotra kokoa
In fact, they did everything.	raha ny marina dia nanao ny zavadrehetra izy ireo
He looked around, but saw no one.	nijery manodidina izy fa tsy nahita olona
But that was a long way off.	lavitra anefa izany taminizany
You couldn't do that.	tsy afaka nanao izany ianao
There is too much space around it.	be loatra ny toerana manodidina azy
And even to me.	ary na dia amiko aza
It doesn’t seem to matter much.	toa tsy dia zavadehibe loatra izany
The time is very near.	tena akaiky ny fotoana
I never did anything to him.	tsy nanao na inona na inona taminy mihitsy aho
And you can.	ary azonao atao
A lot of time wasted.	be dia be ny fotoana very
He knew he had made money.	fantany fa nahazo vola izy
Then an idea came to him.	nisy hevitra tonga tao aminy avy eo
He doesn’t have either.	tsy manana koa izy
Too good to be true, that is.	tsara loatra raha marina izany hoe
Of course it’s nice to see you.	mazava ho azy fa mahafinaritra ny mahita anao
It’s always a war.	ady foana izany
It may just be low.	mety ho ambany ihany izany
He was still thinking about it.	mbola nieritreritra izany izy
Both didn’t immediately fall in love.	samy tsy tia avy hatrany ireo roa ireo
The same seems to be true of him.	toa izany koa ny momba azy
Both are easy to understand.	samy mora azo
He told her often.	nilaza taminy matetika izy
I think everyone should do it once.	heveriko fa tokony hanao izany indray mandeha ny tsirairay
No one wanted to go there.	tsy nisy olona te ho any
But not much.	saingy tsy betsaka
I became addicted to food.	lasa tia sakafo aho
We might have done that.	mety ho nanao izany isika
These are the same people who did it.	ireo olona ireo ihany no nanao izany
The man is gone.	lasa ny lehilahy
But it seems to be the same.	saingy toa izany ihany
The men also stopped.	nijanona koa ny lehilahy
He has two options.	manana safidy roa izy
And worse, it seems to end.	ary ny ratsy kokoa toa farany
Still a very good thing.	mbola zavatra tena tsara
I know each and every one of them.	fantatro ny tsirairay aminizy ireo
Or it may not make sense.	na mety tsy misy dikany izany
Or something else is wrong.	na zavatra hafa no tsy mety
It’s like doing it right.	toy ny hoe manao izany tsara
He didn't need to do that.	tsy nila nanao izany izy
However, this is still unclear.	mbola tsy mazava anefa izany
Sure, it could be wrong.	azo antoka fa mety ho diso
He should be with you.	tokony ho eo aminny anao izy
Kind of okay, they say.	karazana mety hoy izy ireo
This thing had it all.	nanana ny zavatra rehetra io zavatra io
For both of them.	ho azy roa
We hope they will.	manantena izahay fa hanao izany izy ireo
They really are.	izy ireo tokoa
There was no reason for them.	tsy nisy antony ho azy ireo
This is difficult to do, in fact.	sarotra ny manao izany raha ny marina
But there must be news.	saingy azo antoka fa tsy maintsy misy vaovao
It just seems fun.	toa mahafinaritra fotsiny izany
It is very good and works well.	tena tsara izy io ary miasa tsara
It was the happiest time for me.	io no fotoana nahafinaritra indrindra tamiko
But that is not the case today.	tsy izany anefa no zavamisy aminizao fotoana izao
Two questions about that.	fanontaniana roa momba izany
However, you should know this.	na izany aza tokony ho fantatrao izany
This can be really bad at first.	mety ho tena ratsy izany aminny voalohany
That was good, but only in a small way.	tsara izany saingy taminny fomba kely ihany
He didn't get it.	tsy nahazo izy
They all look good.	toa tsara daholo ireo
I have had this problem in the past.	nanana ity olana ity aho taminny lasa
Something went wrong.	nisy zavatra lasa
I can go there.	afaka mandeha any aho
We looked at everything.	nijery ny zavadrehetra izahay
Two women, three men.	vehivavy roa lehilahy telo
He is just like me.	mitovy amiko ihany izy
But there were two other moments.	saingy nisy fotoana roa hafa
Now, both are gone on the same day.	aminizao fotoana izao samy lasa taminny andro iray ihany
This is very true, in fact.	tena marina izany raha ny marina
They have to watch it all.	tsy maintsy mijery ny rehetra izy ireo
There is no such thing as a person like me.	tsy misy toy izany ny olona toa ahy
Some know it very well.	ny sasany fantany tsara tokoa
They are both gone.	samy lasa izy ireo
Everyone will be happy.	ho faly ny rehetra
However, it may be better than your upstairs.	na izany aza mety ho tsara kokoa noho ny tany ambony anao izany
That probably is.	izay angamba
For good reason.	noho ny antony tsara
It's the same with them.	mitovy aminizy ireo ihany izany
It’s not about that.	tsy momba izany izy
All that.	ny rehetra fa
But he loved them.	tiany anefa izy ireo
He is not the type of person.	tsy karazana olona izy
It is very new.	vaovao be izy io
I’m going crazy here.	lasa adala aho eto
You need clarity first.	mila ny mazava aloha ianao
From another life.	avy aminny fiainana hafa
You will do well.	hanao tsara ianao
One for all and for one.	iray ho anny rehetra ary ho anny iray
Many have, many will.	maro no manana maro no hanao
Maybe he had something in it.	angamba nanana zavatra tao izy
Sometimes more often, sometimes less.	indraindray matetika kokoa indraindray kely kokoa
I think we need more of that.	heveriko fa mila bebe kokoa aminizany isika
I saw a lot of problems.	nahita olana be dia be aho
I want him there.	tiako ho eo izy
However, other ideas are possible.	na izany aza misy hevitra hafa azo atao
When you are absolutely sure.	rehefa tena azo antoka ianao
Yes, they didn’t find anyone.	eny tsy hita olona iray izy ireo
Men are great men.	ny lehilahy dia lehilahy lehibe
Yes, it was a fun time.	eny nisy fotoana nahafinaritra
They are still wrong.	mbola diso hevitra izy ireo
Do it as normal or as crazy as you like.	ataovy toy ny mahazatra na adala araka izay tianao
I think you like him.	heveriko fa tianao izy
Either way, it’s sure to be completely crazy.	na izany na tsy izany azo antoka fa ho adala tanteraka
But below it is the same.	fa eo ambany izy dia mitovy
You can do it, just two.	afaka manao izany roa fotsiny
You have to do the work.	tsy maintsy manao ny asa ianao
I think there was.	heveriko fa nisy izany
I know you will be happy.	fantatro fa ho faly ianao
This is just for me.	ho ahy ihany ity
Make mistakes and do nothing.	ataovy diso ary tsy misy atao
Everyone has to do it.	tsy maintsy manao izany ny rehetra
I don't need that money.	tsy mila izany vola izany aho
It has become all too common.	lasa mahazatra loatra izany
He went like this.	nandeha toy izao izy
I have, in fact.	manana aho raha ny marina
He was in the game.	tao aminny lalao izy
And not just for me.	ary tsy ho ahy ihany
There was, in fact, a war.	nisy ady ihany raha ny marina
It’s never seen.	tsy hita mihitsy izany
And, sometimes, it all seems too easy.	ary indraindray toa mora loatra izany rehetra izany
That will be the hardest.	izay no ho mafy indrindra
It will still be there.	mbola ho hita eo izany
The lost one is found again.	hita indray ilay very
The man does a lot of work.	manao asa be dia be ilay lehilahy
I need to be there.	mila ao aho
But it’s all about time.	fotoana daholo anefa izany
And he did it well, too.	ary nanao izany tsara koa izy
There is no way.	tsy misy lalana
Maybe even so.	angamba na dia eo aza izany
This is how it goes.	toy izany no manaraka
He needed her.	nila azy izy
It wouldn’t be right here without it.	tsy mety ny eto raha tsy misy azy
Maybe they are made for you.	angamba natao ho anao izy ireo
That’s a lot of people.	olona maro izany
That’s true, but it’s too hard.	marina izany saingy sarotra loatra
There must be another life there.	tsy maintsy misy fiainana hafa any
He is not always right.	tsy marina foana izy
In that case, there is still a future.	aminizany dia mbola misy ny ho avy
The truth is worse.	ratsy kokoa ny marina
It became a job like anything else.	lasa asa toy ny zavatra hafa rehetra izany
The top is the same as that of an older woman.	ny ambony dia mitovy aminny anny vehivavy lehibe
He stopped and watched.	nijanona izy ka nijery
This is not a bad thing at all.	tsy ratsy mihitsy izany
So a very good result.	ka vokatra tena tsara
I am a nice guy.	lehilahy mahafinaritra aho
He has one of these.	manana iray aminireo izy
That’s the hard part.	izany no sarotra
A lot of people don’t work.	betsaka ny olona tsy miasa
Lots of special events.	betsaka ny hetsika manokana
They just took the next step along the way.	nanao ny dingana manaraka fotsiny izy ireo taminny lalana
He needs to be around.	mila eo akaiky izy
He said they did it.	nilaza izy fa izy ireo no nanao azy
And there.	ary any
That is better than life.	izany hoe tsara noho ny fiainana
Some steps can be difficult.	mety ho sarotra ny dingana sasany
But you did a great job.	fa nanao asa lehibe ianao
In fact, it may be more difficult.	raha ny marina dia mety ho sarotra kokoa izany
We can’t always have the same conversation.	tsy afaka manao resaka mitovy hatrany isika
Now you need money too.	ankehitriny ianao mila vola koa
But it is always there.	foana foana anefa izy io
I know.	fantatro
But it is not completely dead.	tsy maty tanteraka anefa izany
But it is much more than that.	mihoatra lavitra noho izany anefa izany
We finally found something right.	nahita zavatra mety izahay taminny farany
He had people.	nanana ny olona izy
You will still know the truth.	mbola ho fantatrao ny marina
Now, that’s a fact.	ankehitriny zavamisy izany
Then you are gone.	dia lasa ianao
But you are wrong.	fa ianao no diso
Not that he thought.	tsy hoe nieritreritra izy
However, some of them are not bad.	na izany aza ny sasany aminizy ireo dia tsy ratsy
He does so, not by choice.	manao izany izy fa tsy noho ny safidy
The real hard work begins now.	manomboka izao ny tena asa mafy
That’s a lot of cars.	fiara maro izany
I think you have to make money from work.	heveriko fa tsy maintsy mahazo vola aminny asa ianao
But it is only one.	iray ihany anefa izany
Immediately when I thought about it.	avy hatrany rehefa nieritreritra izany
He started at the very bottom.	nanomboka teo ambany indrindra izy
It was really fun.	tena nahafinaritra tokoa ilay izy
No more bad days.	tsy misy andro ratsy intsony
I found something for myself.	nahita zavatra ho ahy manokana aho
They have good reason.	manana antony tsara izy ireo
Foremost among them is privacy.	voalohany indrindra aminizy ireo ny fiainana manokana
Yes, this little one.	eny ity kely ity
It just seems so.	toa izany fotsiny
He just did it to people.	nanao izany taminny olona fotsiny izy
There didn’t seem to be any.	toa tsy nisy izany na iray aza
There are facts.	misy ny zavamisy
Good game.	lalao tsara
That is more than enough.	mihoatra noho ny ampy izany
And that's it.	dia izany no izy
But, maybe not.	saingy angamba tsy
You know you never needed it.	fantatrao fa tsy nila izany mihitsy ianao
But now it’s better than nothing.	saingy tsara kokoa izao noho ny tsy misy
Fine thanks.	tsara fa misaotra
The trip was well worth it.	tena mendrika izany ilay dia
We are the first thing.	isika no zavatra voalohany
Do it quickly.	ataovy haingana izany
Not only this.	tsy ity ihany
It all seems so complicated.	toa sarotra be izany rehetra izany
The same problem.	ny olana mitovy aminy
If he had a good reason.	raha nanana antony tokony ho izy
The meaning is not very clear.	tsy dia mazava loatra ny dikany
There seemed to be no part of it.	toa tsy nisy ampahany taminy
I needed something real.	nila zavatra tena izy aho
Even some pictures.	na ny sary sasany aza
I can do it with you, or without you.	afaka manao izany miaraka aminao aho na tsy misy anao
It would be bad.	ho ratsy izany
Anything can be done.	na inona na inona azo atao
It’s us.	izahay izany
Look the other way.	jereo ny lalana hafa
Often the exact word is not clear.	matetika dia tsy mazava ny teny marina
The game begins now.	manomboka izao ny lalao
Either one will be a problem.	na ny iray dia ho olana
That’s not even the best part.	tsy izany akory no ampahany tsara indrindra
This game doesn’t make sense to him.	tsy misy dikany aminy ity lalao ity
Some people are similar to the picture.	ny olona sasany dia mitovy aminny sary
You are already confused.	efa very hevitra ianao
Then again, you may not.	avy eo indray mety tsy ianao
It’s all very well and good.	tena tsara sy tsara daholo
He is also small.	kely koa izy
At most, there will be one.	raha be indrindra dia hisy iray
They really had.	tena nanana izy ireo
Take action.	ataovy ny hetsika
But it is close enough to be needed.	akaiky ihany anefa fa ilaina
There are a lot of problems with that.	betsaka ny olana aminizany
You are it.	ianao no izy
But that is far from the future.	lavitra anefa izany taminny ho avy
I would never have been able to stop.	tsy ho afaka nijanona mihitsy aho
He is very good to her.	tena tsara aminy izy
This is a good fight.	ady tsara ity
But it’s like this.	fa mitovy aminity
You know you looked there.	fantatrao fa nijery tany ianao
And you have to do it.	ary tsy maintsy manao izany ianao
These are the two questions.	ireo no fanontaniana roa
It was the same when he left.	toy izany koa rehefa lasa izy
A house has something in common.	ny trano iray dia manana zavatra mitovy
That may be true.	mety ho marina
He thought of doing something else.	nieritreritra ny hanao zavatra hafa izy
Not really sure whether or not that is here.	tsy tena azo antoka fa na izany na tsy izany dia eto
It has to do something that works.	tsy maintsy manao zavatra miasa izy io
Everyone really has something.	tena manana na inona na inona ny tsirairay
That's good, man.	tsara izany lehilahy
This is not bad news.	tsy vaovao ratsy izany
You have to see them.	tsy maintsy mahita azy ireo ianao
But that’s true, you know.	marina anefa izany fantatrao
He needed to go to a safe place.	nila nandeha tany aminny toerana azo antoka izy
This is the world of men.	izao tontolo izao ny lehilahy izao
And they often do.	ary matetika izy ireo no manao izany
But the choice is his.	fa azy ny safidy
But sometimes that’s not enough.	saingy indraindray dia tsy ampy izany
This is the best idea of ​​these.	ity no hevitra tsara indrindra aminireo
But he did not say no.	tsy nilaza koa anefa izy hoe tsia
It’s really hard for me to follow.	tena sarotra amiko ny manaraka
That, in fact, is almost everything about me.	izany raha ny marina dia saika ny zavadrehetra momba ahy
There is a problem there.	misy olana ao
There are times but not all the time.	misy fotoana fa tsy aminny fotoana rehetra
She’s beautiful, and that’s good.	tsara tarehy izy ary tsara izany
Now, maybe they did.	ankehitriny angamba nanao izany izy ireo
But they never had it.	tsy nanana izany mihitsy anefa izy ireo
There seems to be no one there.	toa tsy misy olona ao
Not really.	tsia tena
This has not always been true in the past.	tsy marina foana izany taloha
They don’t deserve it.	tsy mendrika izany izy ireo
Probably not at all.	angamba tsy misy mihitsy
Then we drove a little.	dia nandeha fiara kely
But there is bad news.	saingy misy vaovao ratsy
Then you may already get the idea.	dia mety efa azonao ilay hevitra
The day.	ny andro
And you are really here.	ary tena eto ianao
He went and went.	nandeha izy ary nandeha
It will be hard.	ho mafy izany
But now, and now.	fa izao dia izao ary izao
Life is not the same.	tsy mitovy ny fiainana
But then came the idea.	saingy avy eo dia tonga io hevitra io
It won't be long now.	tsy afaka ela izao
And many other people, it seems.	ary olona maro hafa toa izany
It may not make sense to you.	mety tsy hisy dikany aminao izany
And he must have had a reason.	ary tsy maintsy nanana antony izy
And some are unclear.	ary ny sasany dia tsy mazava
We can start action.	afaka manomboka hetsika isika
I'm not far.	tsy lavitra aho
But this may not be for everyone.	mety tsy ho anny rehetra anefa izany
So do we.	toy izany koa isika
Check out the latest here.	jereo eto ny farany indrindra
But the car is running smoothly.	mandeha tsara anefa ny fiara
The future comes and goes.	tonga sy mandeha ny ho avy
In fact, that statement is true.	raha ny marina dia marina io teny io
This, however, is different.	ity anefa dia hafa
And the distance is better.	ary ny lavitra no tsara kokoa
He had never seen her again.	mbola tsy nahita azy intsony izy
We are all old people.	isika rehetra dia olona taloha
First, they are beautiful.	voalohany tsara tarehy izy ireo
I have a car.	manana fiara
He doesn’t look kind.	tsy mijery ny karazana izy
You are just beautiful.	tsara tarehy fotsiny ianao
You did something for me.	nanao zavatra ho ahy ianao
No need to look.	tsy mila mijery
We have to look at it and see.	tsy maintsy mijery izany isika ary mahita
Not everything is safe.	tsy azo antoka ny zavadrehetra
But it's all very simple.	tsotra be anefa izany rehetra izany
To him.	aminy
That is the way.	izany no lalana
But nothing like that.	tsy nisy toy izany anefa
Someone said no.	nisy nilaza hoe tsia
That is one of the reasons.	izany no iray aminireo antony
In fact, no one is fun.	raha ny marina tsy misy olona mahafinaritra
It’s part of a more complex picture.	ampahany iray aminny sary sarotra kokoa izy io
Even if you don’t like it right now.	na dia tsy tianao aza ianao aminizao fotoana izao
In fact, it’s far worse.	raha ny marina dia ratsy lavitra izany
I have to be mine.	tsy maintsy ho ahy aho
Almost for him.	saika ho azy
He said he could.	nilaza izy fa afaka
It’s one of my favorites.	iray aminireo tiako indrindra izy io
No, we don’t.	tsia tsy manana isika
They are not alone.	tsy izy ireo fotsiny
It must be worse for you.	tsy maintsy ho ratsy kokoa aminao izany
But he has a reason.	manana ny antony anefa izy
I didn’t enjoy it very much.	tsy nahafinaritra ahy loatra izany
They’re certainly not too bad.	azo antoka fa tsy dia ratsy loatra izy ireo
However, it may be the least of its problems.	na izany aza dia mety ho ny kely indrindra aminny olana misy azy
You have to take the first step first.	tsy maintsy manao ny dingana voalohany aloha ianao
There was no one for him at all.	tsy nisy olona ho azy mihitsy
love you again.	tia anao indray
We all go.	isika rehetra dia mandeha
Of course he has, he told himself.	mazava ho azy fa manana izy hoy izy taminny tenany
All the highest.	ny zavadrehetra ambony indrindra
He looks like a man.	toa lehilahy izy
Everything else is general.	ny zavatra hafa rehetra dia aminny ankapobeny
I was lost, a lot of people.	very aho be dia be ny olona
It doesn’t seem to be the end either.	toa tsy ny farany ihany koa
But, of course, we can’t all be right about that.	saingy mazava ho azy tsy afaka ny ho marina daholo isika momba izany
We need something better.	mila zavatra tsara kokoa izahay
Not that he wanted to know.	tsy hoe tiany ho fantany izany
Everyone does it.	manao izany ny rehetra
For many, the real deal is a tough game.	ho anny maro ny tena azo dia lalao sarotra
He went to a better world.	nandeha tany aminny tontolo tsara kokoa izy
That will not be enough.	tsy hoe ho ampy izany
For that reason, it was all real to me.	noho izany antony izany dia tena nisy izy rehetra tamiko
But not this man.	tsy io lehilahy io anefa
And that is the problem.	ary izay no olana
They could be good.	mety ho tsara izy ireo
He needed a little.	nila kely izy
Only one or two thousand.	iray na roa alina fotsiny
True, it is still true today.	marina aloha mbola marina ankehitriny
Sometimes people really see things.	tena mahita zavatra ny olona indraindray
No one has a reason.	tsy misy olona manana antony
Yes, something like that.	eny zavatra toy izany
Because they are not.	satria tsy izy ireo
Yes, good for them.	eny tsara ho azy ireo
Both seem to be going well.	samy toa mandeha tsara
It can become a difficult task.	mety ho lasa asa sarotra izany
Or they had.	na nanana izy ireo
He may be dead.	mety efa maty izy
There were no specific new ideas.	tsy nisy hevitra vaovao manokana
In fact, I did it because it was a last resort.	raha ny marina dia nanao izany satria fomba farany
Look and look again.	jereo ary jereo indray
And sometimes it doesn’t even work.	ary indraindray aza tsy mety izany
And it just can’t work.	ary tsy afaka manao asa fotsiny
He thought like us.	nieritreritra toa antsika izy
If you know it, or not.	raha fantatrao izany na tsia
In doing so, he is certainly partially correct.	aminizany dia azo antoka fa marina aminny ampahany izy
This is very wrong.	tena diso hevitra mihitsy izany
And sometimes ours.	ary indraindray ny antsika
But they must also catch us.	tsy maintsy mahazo antsika koa anefa izy ireo
Not just his but ours.	tsy ny azy ihany fa ny antsika
We are all like them.	mitovy daholo isika aminizy ireo
Not here yet.	tsy mbola misy eto
If he did.	raha nanao izany izy
We can easily go wrong with that.	mety ho diso izany mora foana izahay
I deserve to be there.	mendrika ny ho eo aho
But we are all here.	fa eto isika rehetra
He had been there once.	efa tany izy indray mandeha
So it is.	dia toy izany koa
I think someone said that about me once.	heveriko fa nisy olona nilaza izany momba ahy indray mandeha
So is the man in the picture.	toy izany koa ny lehilahy iray ao aminny sary
But it makes no sense to say all this.	tsy nisy dikany anefa ny nilaza izany rehetra izany
That was all that mattered.	izay ihany no nisy dikany
If so, he has it with him.	raha izany no izy dia manana izany miaraka aminy izy
Really stupid idea.	hevitra adala tokoa
That’s a great idea.	hevitra mahafinaritra izany
Money can still be made.	mbola azo natao ihany ny vola
And it’s not too far away.	ary tsy dia lavitra loatra izany
This is the story.	ity no tantara
First, men.	voalohany ny lehilahy
He seems to know that.	toa fantany izany
And for all of us.	ary ho antsika rehetra
There was no place for him anymore.	tsy nisy toerana ho azy intsony
You don’t want to do anything to him.	tsy te hanao na inona na inona aminy ianao
I see this too often.	hitako matetika loatra izany
It could be one of the two men.	mety ho iray aminireo lehilahy roa
And now you have a problem.	ary manana olana ianao izao
I’m starting from here.	manomboka manomboka eto aho
But then there is a story.	misy tantara anefa avy eo
Yes, she’s beautiful, but it’s much more than that.	eny tsara tarehy izy saingy mihoatra lavitra noho izany
All kinds of people.	karazana olona rehetra
So, none of them are crazy.	noho izany tsy misy adala aminizy ireo
But this is not the case.	tsy zavamisy anefa izany
You are gone, in the end.	lasa ianao aminny farany
There must be a next step.	tsy maintsy misy ny dingana manaraka
Little did he know that there was such a thing.	tsy fantany fa nisy toy izany
Yes, a lot.	eny tena betsaka
He went completely by himself.	nandeha ho azy tanteraka izy
For them, there was no choice.	ho azy ireo dia tsy nisy safidy
Not just the truth.	tsy ny marina fotsiny
Yes, it can be really fun.	eny mety ho tena mahafinaritra izany
He is not a man or a woman.	tsy lehilahy vehivavy izy
Now, he said.	izao hoy izy
Of course, he didn't want to do that.	mazava ho azy fa tsy te hanao izany izy
Happy here.	faly eto
This is not the safest place.	tsy io no toerana azo antoka indrindra
Dead people, in fact.	olona maty raha ny marina
It also goes the other way.	izany koa dia mandeha aminny fomba hafa
He was so good that he became first overall.	tena tsara izy ka lasa voalohany aminny ankapobeny
Maybe for the distant future as well.	angamba ho anny ho avy lavitra koa
Make others look.	ataovy mijery ny hafa
Yes, she is fun.	eny mahafinaritra izy
I had never seen it before.	tsy mbola nahita izany aho taminny voalohany
It’s still important, but not like it used to be.	mbola zavadehibe izany fa tsy toy ny taloha
And maybe he is.	ary angamba izy
He is far away from her.	lavitra azy izy
This is because she is beautiful.	izany dia satria tsara tarehy izy
It often seems impossible to see them together.	toa tsy azo atao matetika ny mahita azy ireo miaraka
I’m not going to get to that, and you know it.	tsy ho tonga aminizany aho ary fantatrao izany
They are often happy here.	matetika izy ireo no faly eto
And it looks great.	ary toa tsara be ilay izy
I watched the night.	nijery ny alina aho
Both are unhappy.	samy tsy faly
Of course, these are not good stories.	mazava ho azy fa tsy tantara tsara ireo
You really know.	fantatrao tokoa
But not next year.	saingy tsy ny taona manaraka
Yes, it's the same.	eny toy izany ihany
But we saw no compelling reason.	tsy nahita antony lehibe anefa izahay
But it seems pointless and ugly.	saingy toa tsy misy dikany sy ratsy izany
But come early.	tonga aloha anefa
Women are different.	hafa ny vehivavy
This is a little different.	zavatra hafa kely ity
However, if everything is important, nothing is too important.	na izany aza raha zavadehibe ny zavadrehetra dia tsy misy zavadehibe indrindra
He never saw it again.	tsy nahita izany intsony izy
And there are also facts.	ary eo koa ny zavamisy
For them, this image is the only one possible.	ho azy ireo dia ity sary ity ihany no azo atao
Very recently, in fact.	vao haingana tokoa raha ny marina
We die fast.	maty haingana isika
We get something from them.	mahazo zavatra avy aminizy ireo isika
Either way, it wasn’t easy to do.	na izany na tsy izany tsy mora ny nanao izany
I can't do anything.	tsy afaka manao na inona na inona
This house is mine now.	ahy ity trano ity ankehitriny
It doesn't work for me.	tsy mety ho ahy izany
And it’s harder.	ary sarotra kokoa izany
Not for that.	tsy natao ho aminizany
I know all about you.	fantatro daholo ny momba anao
You have to do something.	tsy maintsy manao zavatra ianao
But still a good idea.	saingy mbola hevitra tsara
This man is not all there.	tsy ao daholo io lehilahy io
It has to be bigger than that.	tsy maintsy lehibe noho izany
But this is the important thing.	saingy ity no zavadehibe
In fact, it is very easy.	raha ny marina dia tena mora izany
There are a lot of new mistakes.	betsaka ny diso vaovao
It cannot be the same.	tsy mety ho ilay iray ihany
We often see it right away.	matetika isika no mahita izany avy hatrany
You understand why.	azonao ny antony

But that did not happen.	tsy tonga taminizany anefa izany
This is not always possible.	tsy azo atao foana izany
There are other people as well.	misy olona hafa koa
I don’t like it, and neither do you.	tsy tiako izany ary ianao koa
We don’t need to have that idea.	tsy mila manana io hevitra io isika
So, they are the best.	noho izany tsara indrindra izy ireo
Not that it should be.	tsy hoe tokony ho izy
It doesn’t make any sense to me at all.	tsy misy dikany amiko mihitsy izany
Good news first.	vaovao tsara aloha
But we needed him.	nila azy anefa izahay
It’s just a complicated thing.	zavatra sarotra fotsiny
They are all part of it.	ampahany daholo izy ireo
It all seems so far away.	toa lavitra be izany rehetra izany
Then there is such a thing.	avy eo dia misy ny toy izany
If you understand it.	raha azonao izany
Yes, we watched them all.	eny nijery azy rehetra izahay
It is another life.	fiainana hafa indray izany
This is the biggest.	ity no lehibe indrindra
Do nothing.	aza manao na inona na inona
It can’t be anything else.	tsy mety ho zavatra hafa izy
Usually both, respectively.	matetika izy roa tsirairay avy
The real world, as it is.	ny tontolo tena izy toy ny misy azy
It needs to go.	mila mandeha izany
They really work for me.	tena miasa ho ahy izy ireo
So he saw nothing.	noho izany dia tsy nahita na inona na inona izy
Every road needs work.	mila asa ny lalana rehetra
This was not a problem for him at all.	tsy olana taminy mihitsy izany
And now, good news.	ary ankehitriny vaovao tsara
And the story itself, very well.	ary ny tantara mihitsy tena tsara
I'm not going.	tsy mandeha aho
This is the next step.	ity no dingana manaraka
No, they were still there.	tsia mbola teo izy ireo
It just can’t be that way.	tsy mety ho izany ihany
I kind of liked it there.	somary tiako ilay izy tao
I had three you know.	nanana telo fantatrao aho
He did great.	nanao ny lehibe izy
So more people see them.	koa maro kokoa ny olona mahita azy ireo
Works perfectly well.	miasa tsara tanteraka
He was too much for her.	be loatra taminy izy
They are meaningless here.	tsy misy dikany izy ireo eto
Not for cars.	tsy ho anny fiara
Maybe someone had.	angamba nisy olona nanana
We are crowded.	be olona izahay
Not that he had a choice.	tsy hoe nanana safidy izy
He played a great game.	nanao lalao lehibe izy
However, this is generally not necessary.	na izany aza aminny ankapobeny dia tsy ilaina izany
But I don't see that.	tsy hitako anefa hoe izany no izy
Things are just things.	zavatra fotsiny ny zavatra
But none of these methods work for me.	saingy tsy misy aminireo fomba ireo miasa amiko
And it’s not going to be too good.	ary tsy ho tsara loatra izany
But look at it now, look at the inside now.	fa jereo izao izy jereo ny ao anatiny izao
And only then.	ary avy eo ihany
I just need to see you.	mila mahita anao fotsiny aho
Never do that.	aza manao izany mihitsy
One that is closer.	iray izay akaiky kokoa
Great man too.	lehilahy lehibe koa
But it doesn’t seem to work.	saingy toa tsy mandeha izany
The real idea is meaningless.	ny tena hevitra dia tsy misy dikany
I don’t know the next step.	tsy fantatro ny dingana manaraka
There was no more action or time or place.	tsy nisy hetsika na fotoana na toerana intsony
We did our best.	nanao ny tsara indrindra izahay
These can also be very beautiful.	mety ho tena tsara tarehy koa ireo
So it was fun.	ka dia nahafinaritra
He could have said it right away.	afaka nilaza izany avy hatrany izy
Lots of other questions.	betsaka ny fanontaniana hafa
You do bad when you do good.	manao ratsy ianao rehefa manao ny tsara
We arrived early and got the place.	tonga aloha izahay ary nahazo ny toerana
Because it goes really well.	satria tena mandeha tsara
Many questions remained.	maro ny fanontaniana nijanona
They are made for you.	natao ho anao izy ireo
There was no other house.	tsy nisy trano hafa
Not too big, but hard.	tsy dia lehibe fa mafy
He looked very low.	nijery ambany be izy
This place has been around for a long time.	efa ela no nisy io toerana io
A lot is going on in this event.	betsaka ny zavatra mandeha aminity hetsika ity
I think they will be important at some point.	heveriko fa ho zavadehibe izy ireo aminny fotoana iray
We had never had that before.	mbola tsy nanana izany mihitsy izahay teo aloha
It would be great if you could get there.	tena tsara raha afaka any ianao
He deserves better, but all of them.	mendrika ho tsara kokoa izy fa izy rehetra
Things to come, and things past.	ny zavatra ho avy ary ny zavatra efa lasa
It almost never works.	saika tsy miasa mihitsy
There was not enough time.	nisy fotoana tsy ampy
Once, another, and another.	indray mandeha iray hafa ary iray hafa
One word, two words, no more.	teny iray teny roa tsy misy intsony
Never found the easy way out.	tsy nahita ny lalana mora mihitsy
Just looked and watched.	nijery sy nijery fotsiny
Then again, it’s harder now.	avy eo indray mafy kokoa izao
Less.	kely kokoa
And that, perhaps, is a good thing.	ary izany angamba dia zavatra tsara
Got an easy one.	nahazo iray mora
I don’t like it, but it’s quick and easy.	tsy tiako izy io fa haingana sy mora
He may have become too close.	mety ho lasa akaiky loatra izy
And then there was another.	ary avy eo dia nisy hafa
People are often really stupid.	matetika ny olona tena adala
I have no problem with this, so it goes well.	tsy manana olana aho aminity noho izany dia mandeha tsara
It's too strong.	mafy loatra ity
I don't even have a house.	tsy manana trano akory aho
I know everything.	fantatro ny zavadrehetra
We are all too far away.	lavitra loatra isika rehetra
But it’s important.	saingy zavadehibe izany
You shouldn’t have come.	tsy tokony ho tonga ianao
Life comes to you fast.	tonga aminao haingana ny fiainana
Here we are again.	eto indray isika
There are people.	misy olona
We are all lost.	very isika rehetra
And so we are fools too.	ary aminizany dia adala koa isika
You don’t need to be together.	tsy mila miaraka ianao
The essential problems, however, remain.	ny olana tena ilaina anefa dia mbola misy
He does not expect immediate results.	tsy manantena vokatra eo no ho eo izy
He has everything.	manana ny zavadrehetra izy
A good way.	fomba iray tsara
I had to do it.	tsy maintsy nanao anio aho
He said it was us.	nilaza izy fa izahay io
They are not just two facts.	tsy zavamisy roa fotsiny izy ireo
And sometimes more than that.	ary indraindray dia mihoatra noho izany
There are a lot of us here.	be dia be izahay eto
But it may not all be lost.	saingy mety tsy ho very daholo
One sees two steps.	ny iray dia mahita dingana roa
So, the problem doesn’t seem to be solved.	noho izany ny olana dia toa tsy ho afaka
So something is wrong here.	ka misy zavatra tsy mety eto
But they don’t do anything like that.	saingy tsy manao na inona na inona toy izany izy ireo
He will do everything from now on.	hanao ny zavadrehetra izy manomboka izao
She was too happy, too happy.	faly loatra izy faly loatra
Maybe you have never seen anything like it.	angamba mbola tsy nahita zavatra toy izany ianao
And for good reason, too.	ary misy antony tsara koa
And a little money.	ary vola kely
I didn’t start it.	tsy nanomboka izany aho
And some of them are good choices.	ary ny sasany aminizy ireo dia safidy tsara
It suits him.	mety aminy izany
So we are not found.	ka tsy hita izahay
Not too bad here.	tsy dia ratsy loatra ny eto
You are needed here.	ilaina eto ianao
I don’t know the other two.	tsy fantatro ireo roa hafa
That's all.	izay ny rehetra
It will be a very difficult process.	ho dingana sarotra tokoa izany
I am free.	afaka aho
And it could be something completely different.	ary mety ho zavatra hafa tanteraka izany
It’s hard to start all over again.	sarotra ny manomboka indray
The words do make sense.	misy dikany tokoa ny teny
They are not in bad words.	tsy aminny teny ratsy izy ireo
You will really like it.	tena ho tianao izany
You are always first.	ianao foana no voalohany
It seems possible.	toa azo atao izany
I found it very difficult to do so.	hitako fa sarotra be ny nanao izany
The dead are not so bad.	tsy dia ratsy loatra ny maty
So it's not like you.	ka tsy mitovy aminao
There was other work, though not as enjoyable.	nisy asa hafa na dia tsy dia nahafinaritra aza
I immediately recognized the face.	fantatro avy hatrany ilay tarehy
It will be really easy.	tena ho mora izany
It may not be the time.	tsy mety ho fotoana izany
I don’t hope you get it.	tsy manantena aho fa ho azonao
Everything is easier.	mora kokoa ny zavadrehetra
It seems real.	toa tena misy tokoa ilay izy
They are also good because they are so different.	tsara ihany koa izy ireo satria samy hafa be
There is something about him.	misy zavatra momba azy
Because we are not stupid.	satria tsy adala izahay
You or not.	ianao na tsia
And the day was clear.	ary dia mazava ny andro
A lot of people are wrong.	betsaka ny olona diso hevitra
But he really needed it.	tena nila izany anefa izy
There are many of them, too.	maro koa izy ireo
She was very beautiful there.	tena tsara tarehy izy tao
I also really like the good stuff.	tena tiako koa ny zavatra tsara
You can now view anything.	afaka mijery na inona na inona ianao izao
Not the best.	tsy ny tsara indrindra
But I was a little confused.	somary very hevitra ihany anefa aho
It sounds hard, but it’s not.	toa sarotra izany saingy tsy izany no izy
It’s even worth it.	mendrika aza izany
It goes very fast.	lasa haingana dia haingana
This year has been really good.	tena tsara tokoa ity taona ity
And it’s a really good choice.	ary tena safidy tsara izany
It’s easy for him.	mora aminy izany
And some of it was fun.	ary ny sasany taminizany dia nahafinaritra
However, such a process is difficult.	na izany aza sarotra ny dingana toy izany
And very appropriate.	ary tena mety
Yes, all is well.	eny tsara daholo
I know you will.	fantatro fa ho azonao
Some of it goes to necessary actions.	ny sasany aminizany dia mandeha aminny hetsika ilaina
However, both methods have problems.	samy manana olana anefa ireo fomba roa ireo
But not because of you.	fa tsy noho ianao
It wasn’t before.	tsy teo aloha izany
Not that it made sense.	tsy hoe nisy dikany izany
Without them, we would be lost.	raha tsy misy azy ireo dia ho very isika
The particular one seems familiar.	ny iray manokana dia toa mahazatra
And we were happy to do so.	ary faly izahay nanao izany
Same as before.	mitovy aminny efa nisy ihany
One is fast.	ny iray dia haingana
He said he wanted to do a similar move.	nilaza izy fa te hanao hetsika mitovy aminizany
They are full.	feno izy ireo
Here it is exactly the same.	eto dia mitovy tanteraka
And yet you are still good.	ary na dia izany aza dia mbola tsara ianao
I can do more.	afaka manao bebe kokoa aho
It won’t be very fast.	tsy ho haingana be izany
We’ve been doing other things for too long.	efa ela loatra izahay no nanao zavatra hafa
Therefore, this issue is irrelevant.	noho izany ity olana ity dia tsy misy dikany
This is a common question.	fanontaniana mahazatra izany
They had to stop.	tsy maintsy nijanona izy ireo
But it's really bad.	tena ratsy anefa
It will not be the same without you.	tsy ho toy izany koa raha tsy eo ianao
You needed a little space for that.	nila toerana kely taminizany ianao
No one and no one thought of themselves.	tsy nisy olona ary tsy nisy nieritreritra ny tenany
Sometimes we are wrong.	indraindray dia diso isika
The time seemed crazy to me.	toa adala tamiko ilay fotoana
And they don’t know.	ary tsy fantany
But maybe that’s good news.	fa angamba vaovao tsara izany
He has a closer job.	manana asa akaiky kokoa izy
But it starts with me.	saingy manomboka amiko izany
They never stopped.	tsy nijanona mihitsy izy ireo
However, you can’t do it on your own.	na izany aza dia tsy afaka manao izany ho azy irery
Then he looked at him again.	dia nijery azy indray izy
Either way, it didn’t make sense.	na izany na tsy izany dia tsy nisy dikany izany
Whoever walks around keeps coming, many say.	izay mandeha manodidina dia tonga hatrany hoy ny maro
That’s a good idea, but there’s a problem.	hevitra tsara izany saingy misy olana
Then there’s the game.	avy eo dia misy ny lalao
They are meaningless.	tsy misy dikany izy ireo
She looks beautiful.	toa tsara tarehy izy
Smaller and easier.	kely sy mora kokoa
More than he deserves.	mihoatra noho izay mendrika azy
This is very safe.	izany dia tena azo antoka
Work or small work.	asa na asa kely
I've always been like this.	toy izao foana aho
Now they will know.	ankehitriny dia ho fantany
But in general, you can’t go wrong.	saingy aminny ankapobeny dia tsy mety diso ianao
You had an idea.	nanana hevitra ianao
You won’t love them all.	tsy ho tia azy rehetra ianao
The women just watched.	nijery fotsiny ny vehivavy
You will go crazy with that.	ho lasa adala ianao aminizany
He could always have done that.	afaka nanao izany foana izy
There will be no future.	tsy hisy ho avy
They got it right.	nahazo ny mety izy ireo
Or, did it.	na nanao izany
No one loved the game more than he did.	tsy nisy olona tia ny lalao mihoatra noho izy
They are all dead.	maty izy rehetra
It’s all because of me.	izany rehetra izany dia noho ny amiko
Other places as well.	toerana hafa koa
However, lost in thought.	na izany aza very hevitra
Not what you want to see.	tsy izay tianao ho hita
Once there, he is in life.	raha vao eo izy dia eo aminny fiainana
There is a lot of war work today.	be dia be ny asa ady ankehitriny
These are them.	ireo no izy ireo
It looks really great.	toa lehibe tokoa
It may even be invisible.	mety ho tsy hita mihitsy aza ilay izy
They have time.	manana fotoana izy ireo
And there will be more to come.	ary mbola hisy ny manaraka
But that’s just one thing for me.	saingy zavatra iray ihany amiko izany
He became bad.	lasa ratsy izy
I hope he will be gone soon.	manantena aho fa ho lasa tsy ho ela izy
But you still have that option.	saingy mbola manana anio safidy io ianao
You know it was there.	fantatrao fa teo io
Seems like the best option for the job.	toa ny safidy tsara indrindra ho anny asa
Like the first step already.	toy ny dingana voalohany efa
But people can see them.	saingy afaka mahita azy ireo ny olona
Of course I don’t.	mazava ho azy fa tsy manao izany aho
The problem is timing.	ny olana dia ny fotoana
With internal products, we get two products.	miaraka aminny vokatra anatiny dia mahazo vokatra roa isika
Of course, that doesn’t make sense to him.	mazava ho azy fa tsy misy dikany aminy izany
So look at what's already there.	ka jereo izay efa misy
Thanks for watching us.	misaotra nijery anay
And then, more importantly, beyond them.	ary avy eo ny zavadehibe kokoa mihoatra azy ireo
Here is a woman.	ity misy vehivavy
I don’t know that either.	tsy fantatro koa izany
These are not just words.	tsy teny fotsiny ireo
The food was small.	kely ny sakafo
He knows everything around him.	fantany tsara ny manodidina rehetra
And yet, no.	ary na izany aza tsy misy
I have never seen anyone like him.	mbola tsy nahita olona toa azy mihitsy aho
It’s like something is really wrong.	toy ny hoe misy zavatra tena tsy mety
Yes, that is very clear.	eny mazava tsara izany
Better and more beautiful.	tsara sy tsara tarehy kokoa
But some are bigger.	fa ny sasany dia lehibe kokoa
It’s really fun and enjoyable.	tena mahafinaritra sy mahafinaritra tokoa
I have to watch.	tsy maintsy mijery aho
The war should have started.	tokony ho nanomboka ny ady
It is lonely.	irery izy io
It will come at a good time.	ho tonga aminny fotoana tsara izany
There will be more events to come, and here’s why.	hisy hetsika maro kokoa ho avy ary izao no antony
When we grow up.	rehefa lehibe izahay
You have to go see it.	tsy maintsy mandeha mijery azy ianao
I find that to be the most fun.	hitako fa izany no mahafinaritra indrindra
He didn't need a word.	tsy nila teny izy
But great work.	asa lehibe anefa
And people are really stupid.	ary tena adala ny olona
And we were very happy to do so.	ary faly be izahay nanao izany
He is life.	izy no fiainana
I thought of you.	nieritreritra anao aho
That's enough about me.	ampy izay ny momba ahy
But the reality is very complex.	fa ny tena zavamisy dia tena sarotra
It couldn’t be easier.	tsy mora kokoa izany
It went hard.	dia nandeha mafy
Many died.	maro no maty
Just generally.	ny ankapobeny ihany
They can’t be enough.	tsy afaka ny ho ampy izy ireo
Which is real.	izay tena izy
That crazy money.	izay vola adala
Although there is a problem.	na dia misy olana iray aza
This is a real job.	asa tena izy ity
But there is.	misy ihany anefa izany
You will know if you did the right thing or not.	ho fantatrao raha nanao ny marina ianao na tsia
The game was also fun.	nahafinaritra koa ny lalao
He was too good at it.	tsara loatra taminizany zavatra izany izy
But that’s not the only option available.	saingy tsy izany ihany no safidy azo atao
Yes, not all of us.	eny tsy isika rehetra
Of course, this can work in other ways as well.	mazava ho azy fa afaka miasa aminny fomba hafa koa izany
Some never did.	tsy nanao izany mihitsy ny sasany
These are the main reasons.	ireo no tena antony
I got it first.	nahazo voalohany aho
Do it again.	manao izany indray
He works too hard.	miasa mafy loatra izy
Almost everything else, that is.	saika ny hafa rehetra izany hoe
It’s usually like this.	matetika dia toy izao
You are very different.	tena hafa mihitsy ianao
The following is not simple.	tsy tsotra izao manaraka izao
If anything, they are doing better now than before.	raha misy dia manao tsara kokoa noho ny taloha izy ireo ankehitriny
So everyone is the same.	ka mitovy daholo ny rehetra
Pretty good.	tsara tokoa
Only women can get it.	ny vehivavy ihany no afaka mahazo izany
But there is more that can be done.	mbola betsaka kokoa anefa no azo atao
This is fun.	ity dia mahafinaritra
It’s really fun to get it.	tena mahafinaritra ny mahazo izany
He is the person who can get things.	izy no olona afaka mahazo zavatra
He did something for her.	nanao zavatra ho azy
Either way, it doesn’t matter.	na izany na tsy izany dia tsy zavadehibe izany
They had three meals.	nanana sakafo telo izy ireo
Or of course it is.	na mazava ho azy izany
It was very real and real.	tena marina sy tena nisy ilay izy
They enjoyed themselves.	nahafinaritra azy ireo ny tenany

Do it the right way.	manao izany aminny fomba mety
And just beautiful.	ary tsara tarehy ihany

A full story of each.	tantara iray feno tsirairay avy
And it works well.	ary miasa tsara
It's a long way.	lalana lavitra io
In fact, you should do it anyway.	raha ny marina tokony hanao izany ianao na izany aza
Of course, you can’t do that right now.	mazava ho azy tsy afaka manao izany ianao aminizao fotoana izao
He doesn’t like me in the slightest.	tsy tiany aho na dia kely aza
good for him I said.	tsara ho azy hoy aho
He can work.	afaka miasa izy
I will always be there for them.	ho eo foana ho azy ireo aho

This is very important now.	tena zavadehibe tokoa izany ankehitriny
There is no such word.	tsy misy izany teny izany
I think you get the picture.	heveriko fa azonao ny sary
So they did everything right.	noho izany dia nanao ny zavadrehetra tsara izy ireo
Even at night.	na aminny alina aza
There’s no time you can’t do that.	tsy misy fotoana tsy afaka manao izany
So, the process has to be fun.	noho izany ny dingana dia tsy maintsy ho mahafinaritra
They had a decent idea.	nanana hevitra mendrika izy ireo
It's just for you.	ho anao irery ihany no eto
That’s not really the reason at all.	tsy tena antony mihitsy izany
You are real.	tena izy ianao
This is not.	tsy ity
That way, there is no more movement.	aminizany fomba izany dia tsy misy intsony ny hetsika
Of course, this will not happen.	mazava ho azy fa tsy ho tanteraka izany
To me, the choice is simple.	amiko dia tsotra ny safidy
It will never be good.	tsy ho tsara mihitsy izany
Very unusual indeed.	tena tsy mahazatra tokoa
Don’t see them often.	aza mahita azy ireo matetika
One of them is this.	ny iray aminizy ireo dia ity
People love people.	tia olona ny olona
No one was his age.	tsy nisy olona mitovy taona aminy
We all work at it.	miasa aminizany hatrany isika rehetra
I just don’t seem to want to do that.	toa tsy te hanao izany fotsiny aho
Nice and simple always works for me.	tsara sy tsotra dia miasa ho ahy foana
Now he came to me.	ankehitriny dia tonga tamiko izy
Of course, there are other reasons to work.	mazava ho azy fa misy antony hafa miasa

You will know.	ho fantatrao

The good is who does it.	ny tsara dia izay manao izany
But he didn’t and he didn’t and we didn’t.	saingy tsy nanao izany izy ary tsy nanao izany ary tsy nanao izany izahay
Not personal, he told himself.	tsy manokana hoy izy taminny tenany
She was glad it was a woman.	faly izy fa vehivavy ilay izy
Not always, you know, but often.	tsy foana fantatrao fa matetika

He had a simple house.	nanana trano tsotra izy
One thing seems clear.	toa mazava ny zavatra iray
I hope you never do that.	manantena aho fa tsy hanao izany mihitsy ianao
You can still have life.	mbola afaka manana fiainana ianao
But not in a bad way.	saingy tsy aminny fomba ratsy
They are the norm.	izy ireo no mahazatra
It was as if they were meaningless.	toy ny hoe tsy nisy dikany izy ireo
Everything happens for a reason.	misy antony ny zavadrehetra
Everyone has questions.	manana fanontaniana ny tsirairay
You go on a much bigger journey than that.	mandeha dia lehibe lavitra noho izany ianao
The essentials.	ny zavatra tena ilaina
Good to be sure.	tsara ho azo antoka
No no.	tsia tsy misy
But this is not like before.	tsy toy ny taloha anefa izany
The story is tough.	mafy ny tantara
You just have to do it.	tsy maintsy manao izany fotsiny ianao
Now he should come to you.	aminizao fotoana izao dia tokony ho tonga aminao izy
It’s hard at first.	sarotra aloha izany
Nice working people.	olona mahafinaritra miasa
That’s the bottom line of all this.	izany no eo aminny farany ambany aminity zavatra rehetra ity
Everything was real.	tena nisy ny zavadrehetra
Hard to watch, harder not to look.	sarotra ny nijery sarotra kokoa ny tsy nijery
But for now, that’s not right.	saingy aminizao fotoana izao dia tsy mety izany
Maybe he said he did.	angamba izy nilaza fa nanao izany
It’s not special.	tsy manokana izany
This is the best place to see at night.	ity no tena tsara ho hita aminny alina
Now he does not know what is to come.	ankehitriny dia tsy fantany izay ho avy
He seems to be doing a thing or two.	toa manao zavatra iray na roa izy
There were three parts to it.	nisy ampahany telo taminizany
Yes, you said.	eny hoy ianao
You should be very low right now.	tokony ho ambany dia ambany ianao aminizao fotoana izao
And we all go with it.	ary isika rehetra dia mandeha miaraka aminy
Life was too easy for him.	mora loatra taminy ny fiainana
Doing something really bad now.	manao zavatra tena ratsy izao
It is important to look good.	tena ilaina ny mijery tsara
He said he was not there.	nilaza izy fa tsy eo izy
We love you.	mahafinaritra anay ianao
He has no life.	tsy manana fiainana izy
He could have always done that to her.	afaka nanao izany taminy foana izy
And a big one too.	ary lehibe iray koa
It always has something.	manana zavatra foana izy io
But this is not an easy task in general.	tsy asa tsotra anefa izany aminny ankapobeny
What should be the reason.	inona no tokony ho antony
He had seen her before, and recently.	efa nahita azy izy taloha ary vao haingana
However, something was missing.	na izany aza nisy zavatra tsy ampy
You may not agree with me completely.	mety tsy mitovy hevitra amiko tanteraka ianao
But it comes from itself.	fa avy aminny tenany ihany izany
You should too.	tokony koa ianao
And, they may be right.	ary mety ho marina izy ireo
This option is not.	ity safidy ity dia tsy
Not about him, but about himself.	tsy momba azy fa aminny tenany
I kind of like him.	somary tia azy aho
Yes, they did.	eny nahita izy ireo
There is no decent path.	tsy misy lalana mendrika akory
But there is a problem with that.	saingy misy olana aminizany
Anyway, I started thinking.	na izany na tsy izany dia nanomboka nieritreritra aho
Otherwise, the process is very simple.	raha tsy izany ny dingana dia tena tsotra
I think he probably knew.	heveriko angamba fa fantany
This woman is dead.	efa maty ity vehivavy ity
It may or may not come.	mety ho tonga na tsia
Or maybe there was a reason.	na mety nisy antony
We are with them.	miaraka aminizy ireo izahay
He couldn’t walk even if he wanted to.	tsy afaka nandeha izy na dia tiany aza
Just to know.	mba ho fantany ihany
I’m busy, but not like a busy fool.	be atao aho fa tsy toy ny adala be atao
But it seems too hard.	toa mafy loatra anefa izany
They can be found here.	hita eto izy ireo
What's new.	inona koa no vaovao
There is a lot wrong with that.	betsaka ny zavatra tsy mety aminizany
We have no life.	tsy manana fiainana isika
Now, something else.	ankehitriny zavatra hafa
You can't do that.	tsy afaka manao toy izany ianao
That's not even an idea.	tsy hevitra akory izany
He now has other jobs.	nanao asa hafa izy izao
There has to be more to it.	tsy maintsy misy bebe kokoa aminizany
Looking at you.	mijery anao
I usually do this to be easy.	matetika aho no manao izany mba ho mora
Therefore, it is not yet complete.	noho izany tsy mbola tanteraka
And you are the one.	ary ianao no iray
Everyone had to do the same.	tsy maintsy nanao toy izany koa ny rehetra
But the reality is different.	fa hafa ny zavamisy
This one will be different.	ity iray ity dia ho hafa
The real us.	ny tena antsika
That was true of me.	marina tokoa izany tamiko
He was already like that.	izy dia efa toy izany
I really enjoy working on that.	tena tiako ny miasa aminizany
There is no choice.	tsy misy safidy aminizany
Everything is very fast and accurate.	tena haingana sy marina ny rehetra
Go there.	mandeha any
You should.	ianao dia tokony
Too much, too fast.	be loatra haingana loatra
It's very close.	akaiky be izany
That is for sure.	azo antoka koa izany
Very fun event.	hetsika tena mahafinaritra
Everything is always right.	ny zavatra rehetra dia mety foana
That is, it starts at the end.	izany hoe manomboka aminny farany
I have to do something you really like.	tsy maintsy manao zavatra tena tianao aho
It’s not for the most personal.	tsy ho anny tena manokana izany
And there was another reason.	ary nisy antony hafa koa
Then we were confused.	dia very hevitra izahay
In every other way, it’s different.	aminny fomba hafa rehetra dia hafa izany
All good and useful ideas.	hevitra tsara sy ilaina rehetra
Women have problems, big problems.	vehivavy manana olana olana lehibe
But not so.	tsy aminizany anefa
You can find a lot of things here.	afaka mahita zavatra betsaka ianao eto
Simple method, crazy product.	fomba tsotra vokatra adala
So, here, there is another problem.	noho izany eto misy olana hafa
That was no problem for me.	tsy nisy olana tamiko izany
But we were not there.	tsy nisy anefa izahay
But even then, it is not often necessary.	saingy na izany aza dia tsy ilaina matetika
I hope you had a good life.	manantena aho fa nanana fiainana tsara ianao
There is this place.	misy ity toerana ity
It’s not too bad either.	tsy dia ratsy loatra koa izany
Not just the food.	tsy ny sakafo ihany
However, this is less obvious.	tsy dia hita anefa izany
Just as important.	toy ny zavadehibe
As long as they don’t need me.	raha mbola tsy mila ahy izy ireo
We are from there.	avy any izahay
It’s work, even if it’s not worth it.	asa izy io na dia tsy mendrika aza
But not the end.	tsy ny farany anefa
That person is gone.	lasa io olona io
I just left.	vao nandeha aho
The result follows.	manaraka izany ny vokatra
They should do it.	tokony hanao izany izy ireo
But he cannot do it alone.	tsy afaka manao izany irery anefa izy
This is a big problem for you.	olana lehibe izao ho anao
It seems unusual.	toa tsy mahazatra
The next move will be the hardest.	ny hetsika manaraka no ho sarotra indrindra
I am a normal guy.	lehilahy mahazatra aho
More true than false.	marina kokoa noho ny tsy marina
But to love.	fa ho tia
It seemed difficult for him to do so.	toa sarotra taminy ny nanao izany
Still not too big.	mbola tsy dia lehibe loatra
The story had nothing to do with it.	tsy nisy na inona na inona ny tantara
He must be honest.	tsy maintsy manao ny marina izy
It’s a simple process for them.	fomba tsotra ho azy ireo izany
But you must do the same.	tsy maintsy manao izany koa anefa ianao
I had never seen anything like it before.	mbola tsy nahita zavatra toy izany aho taloha
We follow.	manaraka izahay
He is a worthy man.	olona mendrika izy
That’s it for the food !.	izany ary ny sakafo
This works for many reasons.	izany dia miasa noho ny antony maro
There were about.	nisy eo ho eo
It's your fault.	diso aminao izany
But the big one is a bigger man.	saingy ny lehibe dia lehilahy lehibe kokoa
Because of the most convenient location.	noho ny toerana mety indrindra
But even if you do, everything will not be bad.	saingy na dia manao izany aza ianao dia tsy ho ratsy ny zavadrehetra
I knew someone was coming.	fantatro fa hisy olona ho avy
This is really new.	vaovao tokoa izany
There is nothing wrong with going.	tsy misy tsy mety mandeha
Others must have too.	tsy maintsy manana koa ny hafa
Everything is just fun.	ny zavadrehetra dia mahafinaritra fotsiny
But in fact, that is not the case.	saingy raha ny marina dia tsy izany no izy
No one came for me.	tsy misy olona tonga ho ahy
The little ones go a long way.	ny kely dia mandeha lavitra
It was not easy to find him.	tsy mora ny nahita azy
I never thought I had it in him.	tsy nieritreritra mihitsy aho hoe nanana izany tao aminy
There were other good ones.	nisy hafa tsara
For all of us.	ho isika rehetra
It’s always good to see a new face.	tsara foana ny mahita tarehy vaovao
Not according to reality.	tsy araka ny zavamisy
He knew it was true.	fantany fa marina izany
They all watched.	nijery izy rehetra
Sure it should be.	azo antoka fa tokony ho izany
They are easy.	mora izy ireo
I want to make sure you die.	tiako ho azo antoka fa maty ianao
Something good started.	nisy zavatra tsara nanomboka
This is a small problem.	olana kely izany
But there is a problem nonetheless.	saingy misy olana na izany aza
And those that don’t.	ary ireo tsy misy
They are all there.	ao daholo izy ireo
I want it all to go away.	tiako ho lasa daholo izany rehetra izany
Anything lower than the maximum is not enough.	na inona na inona ambany noho ny ambony indrindra dia tsy ampy
Some, like me, just hope for a secure job.	ny sasany toa ahy dia manantena asa azo antoka fotsiny
He was the first but not the first.	izy no voalohany fa tsy
But first, you have to know that it started.	saingy aloha tsy maintsy fantatrao fa nanomboka izany
However, not everyone came.	na izany aza dia tsy tonga ny tsirairay
But otherwise he has no idea.	fa raha tsy izany dia tsy manana hevitra izy
However, there has to be one around here and there.	na izany aza tsy maintsy misy iray manodidina eto any ho any
That was a typical night.	izany hoe alina mahazatra izany
They love us.	tia anay izy ireo
Yes, otherwise, a beautiful place.	eny raha tsy izany toerana tsara tarehy
Some are even bad.	ny sasany aza ratsy
But you have to go now.	fa tsy maintsy mandeha ianao izao
However, this picture is too simple.	na izany aza ity sary ity dia tsotra loatra
More secure.	azo antoka kokoa
But that was the last time.	fa izay no fotoana farany
All ideas are good.	mety tsara ny hevitra rehetra
Not in that.	tsy aminizany
He just wants you to know.	tiany ho fantatrao fotsiny
And you are the woman.	ary ianao ilay vehivavy
There is room for three.	misy toerana ho anny telo ao
Nothing seems possible.	toa tsy misy azo atao
But it’s like starting all over again when it no longer works.	fa toy ny manomboka indray raha tsy miasa intsony
No problem with other activities.	tsy misy olana aminny hetsika hafa
But less for the product.	fa kely kokoa ho anny vokatra
Not really but maybe a little less than the others.	tsy tena fa mety kely kokoa noho ny hafa
The same is true of the house.	toy izany koa ny trano
She said she knew the man in the picture.	nilaza izy fa fantany ilay lehilahy ao aminny sary
It could be as good as it could be.	mety ho tsara araka izay azo atao izany
I can't do it anymore.	tsy afaka manao intsony aho
It’s even better.	tena tsara mihitsy aza
Thus, it must be done in full.	araka izany dia tsy maintsy atao aminny fomba feno
I went completely alone.	nandeha irery tanteraka aho
But that day was different.	hafa ihany anefa izany andro izany
There are many ways.	maro ny fomba
Don’t start with me.	aza manomboka amiko
If you need more, you can work.	raha mila bebe kokoa ianao dia afaka miasa
I don’t know anything about it, really.	tsy fantatro na inona na inona momba izany tena
It didn't even come to a real fight.	tsy tonga taminny tena ady akory
I really enjoyed the food there.	tena nahafinaritra ahy ny sakafo tao
They are also, often, not very good.	izy ireo koa matetika tsy dia tsara loatra
If he didn’t know he wasn’t.	raha tsy fantany fa tsy izy
It does two things.	manao zavatra roa izy io
I know he agrees with me.	fantatro fa mitovy hevitra amiko izy
This one is the worst.	ratsy indrindra ity iray ity
But the place is dead.	saingy maty ilay toerana
Not in this life or in others.	tsy aminizao fiainana izao na aminny hafa
It may even be the easiest part.	mety ho ny ampahany mora indrindra aza izany
This is not a difficult process at all.	tsy dingana sarotra mihitsy izany
And for him.	ary ho izy
You are so much better than that.	tsara lavitra noho izany ianao
But it works in other ways as well.	saingy miasa aminny fomba hafa koa izany
Sure, it’s like one.	azo antoka fa toy ny iray izany
Sounds great.	toy ny hoe lehibe
All of this takes time.	mila fotoana ireo rehetra ireo
I think he is in the right place.	heveriko fa eo aminny toerana tsara izy
I should be here for that.	tokony ho eto aho noho izany
men.	lehilahy
Simple and meaningless.	tsotra sy tsy misy dikany
It was so big and bulky.	tena lehibe sy be dia be ilay izy
They arrived in two cars.	tonga taminny fiara roa izy ireo
It can work.	afaka miasa izany
In fact, it may be more often than not.	raha ny marina dia mety matetika kokoa noho ny tsy izany
There is no such option.	tsy misy safidy toy izany
Sometimes you have nothing to do.	indraindray ianao tsy manana na inona na inona atao
It seems like a worthwhile thing.	toa zavatra mendrika izany
This is not entirely bad.	tsy ratsy tanteraka izany
This is not the only problem.	tsy io ihany no olana
That person is dead.	maty io olona io
All is not lost yet.	tsy mbola very daholo
I have to be able to walk.	tsy maintsy afaka mandeha aho
Some may be like that.	mety ho toy izany koa ny sasany
That is certainly not the case today.	izay no azo antoka fa tsy ny zavamisy ankehitriny
You did it.	natao izany ianao
And that’s the best part.	ary izany no tsara indrindra
Not all pictures are better.	tsy ny sary rehetra no tsara kokoa
This is the top.	ity no ambony
There is no game for you, of course.	tsy misy lalao ho anao mazava ho azy
Overall it went well.	aminny ankapobeny dia nandeha tsara izany
It’s not always fun.	tsy mahafinaritra foana izany
It’s not for the likes of you.	tsy natao ho anny toa anao izany
It was as if he was following me.	toy ny hoe manaraka ahy izy
That's enough for one day.	ampy ho anny iray andro izany
Probably not much.	tsy misy zavatra betsaka angamba
I said, dead people.	hoy aho hoe olona maty
He wants to do it right.	te hanao izany tsara izy
But here, no one.	saingy eto tsy nisy olona
They are always important.	zavadehibe foana izy ireo
Still, it’s pretty cool.	na izany aza dia tena tsara tarehy
We will be the same to him.	ho toy izany koa izahay aminy
I got some bad news.	nahazo vaovao ratsy aho
I know exactly where you are.	fantatro tsara ny misy anao
They do now.	manao izao izy ireo
Everything was new to me.	vaovao tamiko ny zavadrehetra
I know a thing or two.	zavatra iray na roa no fantatro
Definitely the first part.	azo antoka fa ny ampahany voalohany
But he stopped.	nijanona anefa izy
We are doing a good job here.	manao asa tsara izahay eto
Almost everyone does.	saika ny rehetra no manao izany
It didn't really seem to happen to him.	toa tsy tena nisy izany taminy
And he didn’t like the old one.	ary tsy tiany ilay iray taloha
Maybe it’s always been that way.	angamba efa toy izany foana
But it works well, thanks.	saingy miasa tsara misaotra
There was also that.	nisy ihany koa izany
He could not get to the bottom.	tsy afaka tonga tany ambany izy
I may always love you.	mety ho tia anao foana aho
And there is no end to it.	ary tsy misy farany izany
But that is not the case today.	tsy toy izany koa anefa ny ankehitriny
I hope he doesn’t.	manantena aho fa tsy hanao izany izy
Anyway there was no time.	na izany na tsy nisy fotoana
However, it is possible.	na izany aza dia azo atao
That’s too good for now.	tsara loatra izany aminizao fotoana izao
We could have done it, but not for sure.	afaka nanao izany izahay saingy tsy azo antoka
They are all very hard.	tena mafy izy rehetra
And he will do the same.	ary hanao izany koa izy
But he was the only one there.	izy irery anefa no teo
None from men.	tsy misy avy aminny lehilahy
It was as if he were dead.	toy ny maty izy
Everyone should be happy.	tokony ho faly ny rehetra
Then you get three years.	avy eo dia mahazo telo taona ianao
The fact that you saw the news for the first time is irrelevant.	ny zavamisy ianao nahita ny vaovao voalohany dia tsy misy dikany
It really made sense in the context in particular.	tena nisy dikany taminny teny manodidina manokana izany
Special women.	vehivavy manokana
I can't work as hard as this guy.	tsy afaka miasa mafy toa anio lehilahy io aho
Even one day.	na indray andro aza
He should not die alone.	tsy tokony ho maty irery izy
We will do it again.	mbola hanao izany indray isika
Of course you don’t.	mazava ho azy fa tsy manao izany ianao
But it’s really bad.	fa tena ratsy be
Each word should be a valid word.	ny teny tsirairay dia tokony ho teny mety
It still doesn't work.	mbola tsy mandeha ihany
He will come when he knows it is for sure.	ho avy izy rehefa fantany fa azo antoka izany
Very good too.	tena tsara koa
The reason is difficult.	sarotra ny antony
Little has gone too far.	lasa lavitra loatra ny kely
Now the problem is a bit more complicated.	ankehitriny ny olana dia somary sarotra kokoa
It was almost beautiful.	saika tsara tarehy ilay izy
But you are dead now.	fa maty ianao izao
And the idea isn’t that hard.	ary ny hevitra dia tsy hoe sarotra loatra izany
Not too obvious, but kind of good.	tsy dia mazava loatra fa karazana tsara
There is another world in this world.	misy tontolo hafa eto aminity tontolo ity
And then we stopped.	ary avy eo dia nijanona izahay
He will do it for himself.	izy no hanao izany ho anny tenany
It goes often.	mandeha matetika izany
It may seem like it exists, but it’s not.	mety ho toy ny misy izany saingy tsy izany
I was happy with the results.	faly aho taminny vokatra
The food didn’t matter.	tsy nisy dikany ny sakafo
We have a problem.	manana olana izahay
But he never said that.	saingy tsy nilaza izany mihitsy izy
But the reasons are different.	samy hafa anefa ny antony
Part of that is for us.	ny ampahany aminizany dia ho antsika
This is a really fun event.	hetsika mahafinaritra tokoa ity
Maybe he really sees himself now.	angamba tena mahita ny tenany izy izao
The food problem is huge.	ny olana aminny sakafo dia lehibe
They can be good people.	mety ho olona tsara izy ireo
I had no place.	tsy nanana toerana aho
I have another one.	manana iray hafa aho
Just a little faster.	haingana kely fotsiny
But another man.	fa lehilahy hafa
They are used to it.	efa mahazatra azy ireo izany
Smaller is safer.	ny kely dia azo antoka kokoa
Yes, of course you have to come.	eny mazava ho azy fa tsy maintsy tonga ianao
I love the story.	tiako ilay tantara
You know it all.	fantatrao daholo izany
Always done.	natao foana
The first two years were very difficult.	tena sarotra ny roa taona voalohany
He became obsessed with money.	lasa tia vola loatra izy
I think he did too.	heveriko fa nanao izany koa izy
And so they are.	dia toy izany izy ireo
And the truth goes that way.	ary ny marina dia mandeha aminizany lalana izany
It needs a really good picture.	mila sary tena tsara izy io
It’s always nice to see you.	mahafinaritra foana ny mahita anao
There was a lot of fighting at night.	be ny ady natao taminny alina
Yes, there is such a place.	eny misy toerana toy izany
I never had a choice.	tsy nanana safidy mihitsy aho
He doesn’t do it anymore.	tsy manao intsony izy
I need to be in the right place.	mila eo aminny toerana mety aho
Yes, that probably is.	eny izay angamba
But for general reasons.	saingy noho ny antony ankapobeny
We’ve been there before.	efa tany aloha izahay
And he said no.	dia hoy izy hoe tsia
Thanks for the game.	misaotra taminny lalao
I still do it sometimes.	mbola manao izany aho indraindray
Otherwise, it’s not very great.	raha tsy izany dia tsy tena lehibe
People don’t like me very much.	olona tsy tia ahy loatra
But he did nothing.	tsy nanao na inona na inona mihitsy anefa
He could have done the same.	afaka nanao toy izany koa izy
It’s always fun.	mahafinaritra foana
But they seemed to have no choice.	toa tsy nanana safidy anefa izy ireo
He never told her no.	tsy nilaza taminy mihitsy izy hoe tsia
It seemed so sure.	toa azo antoka tokoa ilay izy
I know this work is not easy.	fantatro fa tsy mora izany asa izany
If so, the good certainly outweighs the bad here.	raha izany no izy ny tsara dia azo antoka fa mihoatra ny ratsy eto
Of course, many of these men have gotten better.	mazava ho azy fa maro aminireo lehilahy ireo no lasa tsara kokoa
These are the best of the best.	ireo no tsara indrindra aminny tsara indrindra
Make timing a priority.	ataovy zavadehibe ny fotoana
We have the same problem.	mitovy ny olana mahazo antsika
It seemed real.	toa tena nisy tokoa izany
Words are not needed.	tsy ilaina ny teny
We will both be worthy.	samy ho mendrika izahay
But for us it is so much more.	fa ho antsika dia mihoatra lavitra izany
It seems to have to be more difficult.	toa tokony ho sarotra kokoa izany
He was driving at night.	nandeha fiara izy taminny alina
He looked kind.	nijery ny karazana izy
I'm good to you.	tsara aminao aho
This event was held in the first place.	ity hetsika ity dia natao taminny voalohany
It will go a long way.	dia ho lasa lavitra
They are doing good things.	manao zavatra tsara izy ireo
All of this seems to be true.	toa marina daholo izany rehetra izany
He didn’t see the game.	tsy nahita ny lalao izy
In fact, these words are the most true.	raha ny tena marina dia ireo teny ireo no tena marina
It’s great to have you here.	tena tsara ny manana anao eto
It was all real.	tena nisy daholo izany
But they had to go anyway.	tsy maintsy nandeha ihany anefa izy ireo
But the really fun part is yet to come.	saingy mbola ho avy ny ampahany tena mahafinaritra
This is a very different world, here.	tena tontolo hafa tokoa ity eto
All the same things.	ireo zavatra rehetra ireo ihany
And still not.	ary mbola tsy
Normally, this wouldn’t matter.	raha ny mahazatra dia tsy ho zavadehibe izany
It always goes well.	mandeha tsara foana izany
To me, this is completely wrong.	amiko dia diso tanteraka izany
Anything done to a person.	na inona na inona atao aminny olona iray
I enjoyed the trail.	nahafinaritra ahy ilay lalana
That's all right.	tena izany daholo
Or already.	na efa
However, work is just beginning.	na izany aza vao manomboka ny asa
And some of those who don’t.	ary ny sasany aminireo izay tsy manana
But there was a woman in the picture.	saingy nisy vehivavy iray teo aminny sary
Good idea, but not really.	hevitra tsara fa tsy tena
They are just like me.	tena misy toy ny ahy izy ireo
Anyone have any information about the product ?.	misy manana vaovao momba ny vokatra
But he had no good news for him.	tsy nanana vaovao tsara ho azy anefa izy
Because with or without them, we are still beautiful.	satria na misy na tsy misy azy ireo dia mbola tsara tarehy isika
I hope he does too.	manantena aho fa manao izany koa izy
It’s not difficult in the slightest.	tsy sarotra izany na dia kely aza
However, it is good to start small.	na izany aza dia tsara ny manomboka kely
And people do it.	ary ny olona no manao izany
It's important to them.	zavadehibe aminizy ireo izany
He doesn’t go for everything else.	tsy mandeha aminny zavatra hafa rehetra izy
But they are still everywhere.	mbola teny aminny toerana rehetra anefa izy ireo
That is precisely the wrong path.	izany indrindra no lalana tsy mety
The fight is fun.	mahafinaritra ny ady
We did a lot of nice pictures.	nanao sary mahafinaritra be dia be izahay
We couldn’t have said it better.	tsy afaka nilaza izany tsara kokoa izahay
To him, it was a woman.	ho azy dia vehivavy izany
You may have to do it.	mety tsy maintsy manao izany ianao
Dead or already dead.	maty na efa maty
Often hard.	matetika no mafy
Both must exist.	tsy maintsy misy izy roa
It was a little different.	somary hafa ihany ilay izy
You seem to be different.	toa ho hafa ianao
It was a beautiful house.	trano tsara tarehy ilay izy
Without money, you can’t do anything.	raha tsy misy ny vola dia tsy afaka manao na inona na inona ianao
Because it really did exist.	satria nisy tokoa izany
Below.	eo ambany
What you can do.	izay azonao atao
Just like in real life.	toy ny aminny tena fiainana

I am very happy with the end result.	tena faly aminny vokatra farany aho
The facts are good.	tsara ny zavamisy
And it will be just as real.	ary ho toy ny tena izy io
But this is not always easy.	tsy mora foana anefa izany
In fact, that’s my favorite.	raha ny marina dia izay no tiako indrindra
The world around me is confused.	very hevitra ny tontolo manodidina ahy
He was just another man, and that made a lot of sense.	lehilahy hafa ihany izy ary nisy dikany tanteraka izany
But you were really nice.	fa tena nahafinaritra ianao
It certainly seems so now.	azo antoka fa toa izany aminizao fotoana izao
Many have lost this place.	maro no very io toerana io
Although very easy.	na dia tena mora
He looks different now.	toa hafa izy izao
And then it works fine.	ary avy eo dia miasa tsara
And that might be the best.	ary mety ho ny tsara indrindra izany
I couldn’t be happier actually.	tsy mety ho faly kokoa raha ny marina
And its surroundings.	ary ny manodidina azy
And this place is here too.	ary ity toerana ity koa eto
Of course, this will not be the end.	mazava ho azy fa tsy ho farany izany
But maybe not all of them.	fa angamba tsy izy rehetra
It didn’t make sense, he said.	tsy nisy dikany izany hoy izy
A lot is gone.	betsaka no lasa
We never have, and never will.	tsy manana mihitsy isika ary tsy hanao izany mihitsy

Here it is not so.	eto dia tsy toy izany
You know time goes by.	fantatrao fa mandeha ny fotoana
There is no one like me.	tsy misy mitovy amiko
But that was not the case then.	tsy taminizany andro izany anefa izany

You need your own.	mila ny anao manokana ianao
Which is all fun of course.	izay mahafinaritra rehetra mazava ho azy
It’s not that we don’t have enough money.	tsy hoe tsy ampy vola izahay
It may have other meanings as well.	mety misy dikany hafa koa izany
Everyone came to see him.	tonga nijery azy ny rehetra
He does not love unrighteousness.	tsy tia ny tsy marina izy
It’s a really fun job.	tena asa mahafinaritra izany
She loves this man too.	tiany koa io lehilahy io
This is earlier than ever.	izany no aloha kokoa noho ny teo aloha
But you didn’t think well.	saingy tsy nieritreritra tsara ianao
The house is already starting.	efa manomboka ny trano
Well, we still have.	eny ary mbola manana isika

As you know, you may be missing something.	araka ny fantatrao mety ho very zavatra ianao
I can't have it.	tsy afaka manana izany

Apparently that’s where it started.	toa teo no nanomboka
He seemed to be thinking of a little something.	toa nieritreritra zavatra kely izy
Work as usual.	asa toy ny mahazatra ihany
It’s already too much.	efa betsaka loatra
She is good here.	tsara izy eto

But it’s really fun.	fa tena mahafinaritra
Although there was no war.	na dia tsy nisy ady aza

I know all these things.	fantatro daholo ireo zavatra ireo
But then.	saingy avy eo
I never had much money.	tsy nanana vola be mihitsy aho
It’s a big word but its meaning is simple.	teny lehibe io fa tsotra ny dikany
You have to do it a lot.	tsy maintsy manao izany betsaka ianao
They seem to be the same.	toa mitovy aminizy ireo ireo
In the most difficult times.	aminny fotoana sarotra indrindra
I don't think you really know him.	heveriko fa tsy tena fantatrao izy
And it didn’t stop there.	ary tsy nijanona teo
He may not even be there now.	mety tsy tao akory izy izao
So are all the men here.	toy izany ny lehilahy rehetra eto
I have a big problem, man.	manana olana lehibe aho lehilahy
Everything on earth.	ny zavatra rehetra aminny tany
Here you can have this one.	eto ianao dia afaka manana ity iray ity
But that’s the story here.	fa izay no tantara eto
I started with two ideas, but now I have three.	nanomboka taminny hevitra roa aho fa telo izao
It’s not about things like that.	tsy momba ny zavatra toy izany
For others, this is entirely true.	aminny hafa dia marina tanteraka izany
I think there is something wrong with him.	heveriko fa misy zavatra tsy mety aminy
That part is simple.	tsotra io ampahany io
The best is not at all times.	ny tsara indrindra dia tsy aminny fotoana rehetra
The reason is personal.	ny antony dia manokana
I think we are wrong about that.	heveriko fa diso isika aminizany
I was always there for him.	teo koa aho ho azy foana
You know you are wrong.	fantatrao fa diso ianao
There were two people, a man and a woman.	nisy olona roa lehilahy iray sy vehivavy iray
And after that, it could be the first picture.	ary rehefa afaka izany dia mety ho sary voalohany
I see that I love him.	hitako fa tiako izy
It is also very full.	tena feno koa izy io
Make it clear as follows.	ataovy mazava tsara toy izao manaraka izao izany

But there will be things.	fa hisy zavatra
Money is often scarce.	matetika no tsy ampy ny vola

Not a big part.	tsy ampahany lehibe
I couldn't think.	tsy afaka nieritreritra aho
It will all come at a good time.	ho tonga aminny fotoana tsara izany rehetra izany

The action was fast.	haingana ny hetsika
But everyone is wrong.	diso anefa ny rehetra
He said, this is not yours.	hoy izy tsy anao ity
If you do, don’t take action.	raha manao izany dia aza manao hetsika
She knew she would love it now.	fantany fa ho tiany izany ankehitriny
The game doesn’t make much sense.	tsy dia misy dikany loatra ny lalao
But he loved them.	tia azy ireo anefa izy
He didn't seem to do anything.	toa tsy nanao na inona na inona izy
We have an idea.	manana hevitra izahay
But it’s all a story for another day.	saingy tantara iray ho anny andro hafa izany rehetra izany
He knew he was next.	fantany fa izy no manaraka
He seemed familiar and easy going.	toa mahazatra sy mora nandeha izy
I want her to be happy.	tiako ho faly izy
He is happy now.	faly izy izao
And there it was.	ary dia nisy izany
It’s often about nothing.	matetika dia momba ny tsy misy
The same goes for games.	toy izany koa aminny lalao
Because it is not possible.	satria tsy azo atao izany
It also seemed new to me.	toa vaovao tamiko koa izany
We got it right.	lasa araka ny tokony ho izy isika
He deserves it for that, too.	mendrika izany koa izy noho izany
And it was a beautiful house.	ary trano nahafinaritra ilay izy
Everyone sees them that way.	ny olona rehetra dia mahita azy ireo toy izany
Maybe it would be better.	angamba mety tsara kokoa
We are all women here.	vehivavy daholo isika eto
But, no, not really.	saingy tsia tsy tena
It makes no sense to see otherwise.	tsy misy dikany ny mahita raha tsy izany
I want you to come here.	tiako ho tonga eto ianao
The trip was really fun.	tena mahafinaritra tokoa ilay dia
But you are wrong.	saingy diso ianao
You will be very bad at that.	ho ratsy be ianao aminizany
This is a good story for you today.	ity dia tantara tsara ho anao anio
He made such a difficult journey.	nanao dia sarotra toy izany izy
Don't do anything else without looking at me first.	aza manao zavatra hafa raha tsy mijery ahy aloha
I know you will.	fantatro fa ho ianao
It comes in a variety of foods, same idea.	tonga karazana sakafo mitovy hevitra
Good food is often cheap food.	ny sakafo tsara dia matetika sakafo mora
You were far away.	tany lavitra ianao
Probably, because it was too much.	angamba satria be dia be ilay izy
The day was fun, to say the least.	nahafinaritra ny andro raha ny kely indrindra
That’s what works for me.	izany no miasa amiko
He would never do that to her again.	tsy hanao izany taminy intsony izy
They expect money.	manantena vola izy ireo
Found something else.	nahita zavatra hafa
The game will be like that.	ny lalao dia ho toy izany
But no one was there.	saingy tsy nisy olona tao
He didn't see her very often.	tsy nahita azy matetika izy
He won't be too happy with her now either.	tsy ho faly loatra aminy koa izy aminizao fotoana izao
You deserve better than that.	mendrika tsara noho izany ianao
But we are going well.	mandeha tsara anefa izahay
They are really good ideas.	tena hevitra tsara izy ireo
People are not like that.	tsy toy izany ny olona
So they go with them.	noho izany dia mandeha aminizy ireo izy ireo
He didn’t get the job.	tsy nahazo ilay asa izy
Kind of too.	karazana koa
It was one of those nights.	iray aminireo alina ireo izany
He needed me, and he knew it.	nila ahy izy ary fantany izany
He gets them high.	mahazo azy ireo ambony izy
Personally, yes !.	ny manokana eny
Because it was to him.	satria taminy izany
There are now only three of them.	telo ihany izy ireo izao
And you stayed that way.	ary nijanona toy izany ianao
Almost nothing.	saika tsy nisy na inona na inona
If you like it, it will be.	raha tianao izany dia ho izany
And among other things.	ary aminny zavatra hafa
So make it easy for them.	koa ataovy mora ho azy ireo izany
You walk into it.	mandeha ao anatiny ianao
At first it was very difficult.	taminny voalohany dia tena sarotra
But the first one no longer works.	tsy mandeha intsony anefa ilay voalohany
Same as where it is.	mitovy aminny toerana misy azy
It seems simple but it is not.	toa tsotra fa tsy
i love you here.	tiako ianao eto
I hope it can be seen.	manantena aho fa mety ho hita izany
He has gone farther than any of us.	lasa lavitra kokoa noho ny antsika rehetra izy
I don’t see him working with them.	tsy hitako izy miasa miaraka aminizy ireo
In fact, it is.	raha ny tokony ho izy dia izany no izy
These are insignificant results.	ireo no vokatra tsy misy dikany
Although he died one day.	na dia maty aza izy indray andro
The same is true of things lost and found.	toy izany koa ny zavatra very sy hita
They are all very small.	kely dia kely izy rehetra
I go on time.	mandeha aminny fotoana aho
I said he might do it.	nilaza aho fa mety hanao izany izy
These are very simple.	tena tsotra ireo
Not just people.	tsy ny olona ihany
I've said that before.	efa nilaza izany aho taloha
Sometimes it doesn’t make sense.	indraindray tsy misy dikany izany
I know this is very important.	fantatro fa tena zavadehibe izany
This is also a problem.	olana koa izany
Someone went too hard.	nisy olona nandeha mafy loatra
Then we were all there.	dia teo izahay rehetra
This car is everywhere, there for it.	ity fiara ity dia misy eny rehetra eny misy azy ho azy
Some are not perfect.	ny sasany tsy tanteraka
Today they are present in some but not in all.	aminizao fotoana izao dia misy aminny sasany izy ireo fa tsy aminny rehetra
And that is for the most part.	ary izany dia ho anny ampahany iray
He knows mine.	fantany ny ahy
It seems to have gone well.	toa efa nandeha tsara izany
So this is not really new.	ka tsy tena vaovao izany
In fact, it was a bit fun.	raha ny marina dia somary nahafinaritra
It seems selfish.	toa tia tena
It doesn’t need anything from me.	tsy mila na inona na inona amiko izany
People like us.	olona toa antsika
It’s kind of common.	karazana mahazatra izy io
A lot of people work there.	be dia be no miasa any
The world does not love you.	tsy tia anao izao tontolo izao
They don’t have it anymore.	tsy manana intsony izy ireo
However, the idea is wrong.	na izany aza dia diso ny hevitra
It is, but more than that.	izy io fa mihoatra noho izany
I think he might really love you.	heveriko fa mety tena tia anao izy
It does something else.	manao zavatra hafa izany
Theirs.	azy ireo
This is probably the best.	ity angamba no tsara indrindra
It will be easier for me.	ho mora kokoa amiko izany

But it started.	nanomboka anefa izany
Easier here.	mora kokoa eto
It is meant for us.	natao ho antsika izany

I needed him, personally.	nila azy aho ny tenany manokana
But a lot of work.	fa asa be
Go here and yes.	mandeha eto ary eny
This is all bad news.	vaovao ratsy daholo izany
If you don’t need it, don’t do it.	raha tsy mila izany ianao dia aza manao izany
In fact, you may not even understand it.	raha ny marina mety tsy ho azonao mihitsy aza izany
True, he has had problems in the past.	marina fa nanana olana taminny lasa izy
I should have known about it.	tokony ho fantatro ny azy
Of course, that was a long time ago.	mazava ho azy fa efa ela izany
Just crazy.	adala fotsiny
He knows where you are.	fantany ny misy anao
We enjoyed them.	nahafinaritra anay izy ireo
Good way, in general.	fomba tsara aminny ankapobeny
If you are wrong, he is dead.	raha diso ianao dia maty izy
They both said yes, it’s the same for them.	samy nilaza izy ireo hoe eny mitovy aminny azy izany
And plenty of space.	ary toerana be dia be

However, as before.	na izany aza toy ny teo aloha

We need that money.	mila izany vola izany izahay
He didn't know you were here.	tsy fantany fa eto ianao
He is gone now.	efa lasa izy izao

No, you didn't do well.	tsia tsy nanao tsara ianao
It’s a personal story.	tantara manokana izany
But none of these men do.	tsy misy manao izany anefa ireo lehilahy ireo
I have something for you.	manana zavatra ho anao aho

They never did.	tsy nanao izany mihitsy izy ireo

We still have the house as well.	mbola manana ny trano ihany koa izahay
Travel is necessary.	ilaina ny dia
And it didn’t go well.	ary tsy nandeha tsara
And it was in him now.	ary tao aminy izany ankehitriny
Time is everything.	ny fotoana dia ny zavadrehetra
Although this is not the case with some people.	na dia tsy mitovy hevitra aminny olona sasany aza izany
He did it all.	nanao izany rehetra izany izy
Everyone acts like they have a choice.	ny olona rehetra manao toy ny manana safidy
You should understand these things in context.	tokony ho azonao aminny teny manodidina ireo zavatra ireo
But they are working on it.	miasa aminizany anefa izy ireo
One is no better than the other in general.	ny iray dia tsy tsara noho ny iray aminny ankapobeny
But we had to do something.	tsy maintsy nanao zavatra anefa izahay
They are no easier.	tsy mora kokoa izy ireo
He has two other locations.	manana toerana roa hafa izy
It’s always a time that never seems to work.	fotoana foana izay toa tsy mety miasa mihitsy
I’m starting to love him.	manomboka tia azy aho
I now know the truth.	fantatro izao ny marina
And we are only human.	ary isika dia olona ihany
But they came quickly.	tonga haingana anefa izy ireo
But we are still here.	saingy eto ihany isika
Very good at some things.	tena tsara aminny zavatra sasany

In fact, it works well.	raha ny marina dia miasa tsara izy io

It may not be too big.	mety tsy ho lehibe loatra izany
This is something you should be well aware of.	zavatra tokony ho fantatrao tsara izany
In this regard.	noho izany
He needed to get away from things.	nila lavitra ny zavatra izy
There should be no one in it.	tsy tokony hisy olona ao anatiny
Some still exist, many do not.	ny sasany mbola misy ny maro tsy
We are all the same now, all small.	mitovy daholo isika izao kely daholo
Which would be a really bad idea.	izay mety ho hevitra tena ratsy
Whatever you get.	na inona na inona azonao
It still doesn’t make sense.	mbola tsy misy dikany izany
There is no one else for me.	tsy misy olona hafa intsony ho ahy
But it’s not one of them.	saingy tsy iray aminizy ireo izany
This game is something that is rarely seen.	ity lalao ity dia zavatra tsy hita matetika
And they work.	ary miasa izy ireo
They are where they are.	izy ireo no misy azy ireo
Even the big games are dead.	eny fa na dia ny lalao lehibe aza dia maty
Of course we said yes.	mazava ho azy fa hoy izahay eny
We don't love you.	tsy tia anao izahay
No one loves me.	tsy misy tia ahy
He had more than one reason to be happy.	nanana antony mihoatra ny iray tokony ho faly izy
I’ve seen it all before.	efa hitako aloha izany rehetra izany
The other way is the essential part.	ny lalana hafa dia ny ampahany tena ilaina
It was a big fight.	ady lehibe izany
But this is crazy.	adala anefa ity
They looked good.	nijery tsara izy ireo
The result is from.	ny vokatra dia avy aminny
Yes, they can get more results.	eny afaka mahazo vokatra bebe kokoa izy ireo
There was something bad about the dead man.	nisy zavatra ratsy momba ilay lehilahy maty

They see a lot.	mahita betsaka izy ireo
And no, not once, of course.	ary tsia tsy indray mandeha mazava ho azy
Like a good fool.	toy ny adala tsara
You are always right.	marina foana ianao
So that’s all.	dia izany no zavadrehetra
Certainly not you.	azo antoka fa tsy aminao
It's been too long.	efa ela loatra izay
Too much money.	vola be loatra
It seems to work well.	toa miasa tsara
Once upon a time, they said.	indray mandeha hoy izy ireo
I could be.	mety ho aho
He will not be happy about it.	tsy ho faly aminizany izy
So, another top might be good.	noho izany ambony iray hafa dia mety ho tsara
I think it's very clear.	heveriko fa mazava be ilay izy
And even the earth is not full.	ary na ny tany aza tsy feno
Both are more beautiful than the next.	samy tsara tarehy noho ny manaraka
Now it has finally come.	ankehitriny dia tonga ihany izany
You will love it there.	ho tianao izany any
Maybe he's right.	marina angamba ny azy
Not now but in general.	tsy aminizao fotoana izao fa aminny ankapobeny ihany
And around all life.	ary manodidina ny fiainana rehetra
The information, however, is incomplete or incorrect.	ny vaovao anefa dia tsy feno na diso
But that doesn’t make sense now.	saingy tsy misy dikany izany ankehitriny
He doesn't need anyone.	tsy mila olona izy
But that option is no longer there.	saingy tsy eo intsony izany safidy izany
He always started the conversation.	izy foana no nanomboka ny resaka
This woman was meaningless.	tsy nisy dikany io vehivavy io
They are very similar.	tena mitovy izy ireo
Seems pointless.	toy ny tsy nisy dikany
But nothing seems to work.	saingy toa tsy misy miasa
It seems very clear.	toa mazava be
But it’s still good.	saingy mbola tsara izany
I don’t need anything very certain.	tsy mila zavatra tena azo antoka aho
He needs you in this world.	mila anao eto aminity tontolo ity izy
Everything is going well now.	mandeha izao ny zavadrehetra
This is just one of them.	iray aminireo ihany ity
And it was lost.	ary very izany
She no longer looked beautiful.	tsy nijery tsara tarehy intsony izy
He knew it was.	fantany fa izany no izy
There is absolutely no truth.	misy marina tanteraka
And it’s harder than you know.	ary sarotra kokoa noho ny fantatrao izany
That is a good reason for us.	antony tsara ho antsika izany
There they stayed.	teo izy ireo no nijanona
Better than the two of us.	tsara noho isika roa
About the news.	momba ny vaovao
But first.	fa aloha izany
But it's on him.	fa eo aminy izany
And that’s too bad.	ary ratsy loatra izany
I work with all of me now.	miasa aminny ahy rehetra aho izao
I didn’t think well, of course.	tsy nieritreritra tsara aho mazava ho azy
I have to grow up.	tsy maintsy ho lehibe aho
That should be a way.	tokony ho fomba iray izany
I have never done anything like that.	tsy nanao zavatra toy izany mihitsy aho
He went alone.	nandeha irery izy
Some great.	ny sasany lehibe
Not a bad deed either.	tsy asa ratsy koa
About me and about me.	ny momba ahy sy ny momba ahy
I don't think you need that.	heveriko fa tsy mila izany ianao
One of the worst as well.	iray aminireo ratsy indrindra ihany koa
We have to look at it.	tsy maintsy mijery izany isika
But small things are not enough.	saingy tsy ampy ny zavatra kely
The same will be true.	ho toy izany koa ny zavamisy
Past time and everything.	fotoana lasa sy ny zavatra rehetra
That’s because it’s not.	izany dia satria tsy izany
It is important to look inside.	tena ilaina ny mijery ny ao anatiny
He was there, at last.	teo izy teo aminny farany
But it has to be one or the same.	tsy maintsy ho iray na iray ihany anefa izany
But it still doesn’t work.	saingy mbola tsy mandeha ihany
You, he said.	ianao hoy izy
You are better than this.	tsara noho ity ianao
And, in fact, many do not.	ary raha ny marina maro no tsy
Great idea for an event.	hevitra tsara ho anny hetsika
He really loves the game.	tena tia ny lalao izy
Now you need to do something about it.	ankehitriny dia mila manao zavatra aminizany ianao
They had their best years.	nanana ny taona tsara indrindra izy ireo
The future begins now.	manomboka izao ny ho avy
Only He can have you.	izy ihany no afaka manana anao
Then he seemed to be thinking of something.	dia toa nieritreritra zavatra izy
You have to do it right.	tsy maintsy manao izany araka ny tokony ho izy
Lots to watch.	be dia be ny mijery
And not all of them either.	ary tsy izy rehetra koa
So there he is.	ka any izy
I can't find the one.	tsy hitako ilay iray
They may have something.	mety manana zavatra izy ireo
And start getting the word for themselves.	ary manomboka mahazo ny teny ho anny tenany
There are about.	misy eo ho eo
There was action now.	nisy hetsika izao
We become closer.	lasa akaiky kokoa isika
And there is nothing wrong.	ary tsy misy ratsy
Or as good as nothing.	na tsara toy ny tsy misy
You love me.	tia ahy ianao
There is almost no truth.	saika tsy hisy mihitsy ny marina
It’s totally money.	vola tanteraka izany
These are the ones.	ireo no ireo
Very good product.	vokatra tena tsara
The reason is very simple.	tsotra dia tsotra ny antony
You don’t have them yet.	mbola tsy manana azy ireo ianao
But, it’s a little different.	saingy hafa kely izany
So people have no idea.	ka noho izany dia tsy misy hevitra ny olona
They are also easy to find.	mora hita ihany koa izy ireo
He could have said far worse things.	afaka nilaza zavatra ratsy lavitra izy
Maybe it’s you.	angamba ianao io
You really have no idea.	tena tsy manana hevitra ianao
We don’t do that here.	tsy manao izany izahay eto
In general, this is enough for them.	aminny ankapobeny dia ampy ho azy ireo izany
It won’t be as good as yours, but it will be perfect.	tsy ho tsara toy ny anao izany fa ho tanteraka
In a new way with something.	aminny fomba vaovao aminny zavatra iray
People thought of two things.	nieritreritra zavatra roa ny olona
But one thing seems clear.	toa mazava anefa ny zavatra iray
It may come.	mety ho tonga
We went well.	nandeha tsara izahay
That stuff is good for me.	tsara izany zavatra izany amiko
In fact, you will not be able to come.	raha ny marina dia tsy ho afaka ny ho avy ianao
Sure to be alone.	azo antoka ny ho irery
He enjoyed it.	nahafinaritra azy ilay izy
He’s very special, you know.	tena manokana izy fantatrao
Then the game.	avy eo ny lalao
The day is clear to me.	mazava ho ahy ny andro
I could be completely wrong.	mety ho diso tanteraka aho
Especially for the same reason.	indrindra noho ny antony mitovy
I really don’t want to go or do that either.	tena tsy te ho lasa aho na hanao koa
I said, no.	hoy aho hoe tsia
We often love him.	matetika isika no tia azy
They should be here.	tokony ho eto izy ireo
You can do it whatever you want.	azonao atao izany na inona na inona tianao
And he is close.	ary akaiky izy
It just doesn’t work as long as we’re together.	tsy mandeha ihany izany raha mbola miaraka isika
It seems like two different people to me now.	toa olona roa samy hafa izy io amiko ankehitriny
And for no particular reason.	ary tsy misy antony manokana
He really needed money.	tena nila vola izy
In fact, it was as if he were real.	raha ny marina dia toy ny hoe tena izy tokoa izy
It needs to be good.	mila tsara izany
If you have already done so, check again.	raha efa nanao izany ianao dia jereo indray
I know he saw it.	fantatro fa nahita azy izy
They can do whatever they want.	afaka manao izay tiany izy ireo
For the time to come.	ho anny fotoana ho avy
Because he was there.	satria teo izy
Not that it’s wrong sometimes.	tsy hoe diso indraindray
He did it all.	nanao izany rehetra izany
It couldn’t and didn’t exist.	tsy afaka ary tsy nisy toy izany
Yes, we said so.	eny nilaza izany izahay
Yeah, we’re just having fun.	eny mahafinaritra fotsiny izahay
Now with the facts.	ankehitriny aminny zavamisy
But, he doesn’t have many options.	saingy tsy manana safidy maro izy
He is now starting to get it.	nanomboka nahazo izany izy izao
So he is.	ka izy ihany
It may be important and it may not be.	mety ho zavadehibe izany ary mety tsy ho
He’s crazy and that’s it.	adala izy ary izany no izy
I said.	hoy aho hoe
He is the only one here.	izy irery no eto
Sometimes it’s just maybe the same.	indraindray dia mitovy ihany angamba izany
This is more secure than the previous option.	ity dia azo antoka kokoa noho ny safidy teo aloha
I didn't get a job.	tsy nahazo asa aho
I would be really alone without you.	tena ho irery aho raha tsy misy anao
I could see that he was thinking hard.	hitako fa nieritreritra mafy izy
He just doesn’t.	tsy manao fotsiny izy
And we will do that to them.	ary hanao izany aminizy ireo izahay
It was a great time for both of us.	fotoana nahafinaritra anay roa izany
Also, very well done.	ary koa tena tsara natao
There is no guarantee of anything.	tsy misy antoka na inona na inona
We are far from everyone.	lavitra ny olona rehetra izahay
I am a woman, not a woman.	vehivavy aho fa tsy vehivavy
They just did it.	vao avy nanao izany izy ireo
No woman deserves that.	tsy misy vehivavy mendrika izany
Maybe this is you.	angamba ianao ity
In fact, they seemed happy with themselves.	raha ny marina toa faly taminny tenany izy ireo
Never has, never will be.	tsy mbola nisy tsy hisy mihitsy
There were no pictures at all.	tsy nisy sary mihitsy
You are the only one missing.	ianao irery no tsy hita
He could have done both.	afaka nanao azy roa ireo izy
The world just seems different.	toa hafa fotsiny izao tontolo izao
It may be there one day.	mety ho izy indray andro any
It will be no different.	tsy ho hafa izany
He needed to do it quickly.	nila nanao izany haingana izy
You will be foolish to see him.	ho adala ianao raha mahita azy
And then, fine.	ary avy eo tsara
He has always been like that.	toy izany foana izy
Yes, good and bad.	eny tsara sy ratsy
And even if they aren’t the biggest.	ary na dia tsy izy ireo aza no lehibe indrindra
Things have to be good.	tokony ho tsara ny zavatra
He never enjoyed it.	tsy nahafinaritra azy mihitsy izany
And they should be the same.	ary tokony ho toy izany koa izy ireo
Many of them are alone.	maro aminizy ireo no irery
Then get decent food.	dia mahazo sakafo mendrika
Good place to get lost.	toerana tsara ho very
Now the game is on.	aminizao fotoana izao dia mandeha ny lalao
It won't be long either.	tsy ho ela koa izany
That seemed like a good idea to me.	toa hevitra tsara izany tamiko
I will do more of these.	hanao bebe kokoa aminireo aho
Yes, in fact, both of them.	eny raha ny marina ny roa aminizy ireo
Otherwise, it is not necessary.	raha tsy izany dia tsy ilaina izany
I know there are only three of them.	fantatro fa telo ihany izy ireo
But, this is the highest.	saingy io no ambony indrindra
But it turns out they aren’t.	saingy hita fa tsy izy ireo
He is different from some of the others.	tsy mitovy aminny sasany aminireo hafa izy
Getting started? 	manomboka
He might be more deserving.	mety ho mendrika kokoa izy
and he could not find them.	ka tsy nahita azy izy
We have a conversation.	misy resaka izahay
It’s just a special time.	fotoana manokana fotsiny io
But they did a good job.	nanao asa tsara anefa izy ireo
In fact, it could be completely different.	raha ny marina dia mety ho hafa tanteraka ilay izy
He was just getting started.	vao nanomboka izy
But it is meant for the future.	fa natao ho anny ho avy izany
And tonight.	ary anio alina
It was a wonderful day.	andro nahafinaritra io
It is even better to be honest.	mbola tsara kokoa aza ny manao ny marina
If this year, it could be better or bigger.	raha aminity taona ity dia mety ho tsara kokoa na lehibe
There are other possibilities as well.	misy ihany koa ny mety hafa
I always thought it was really important.	nieritreritra foana aho fa zavadehibe tokoa izany
I think we really need another word.	heveriko fa mila teny hafa mihitsy isika
The story is good.	tsara ilay tantara
Night work.	ny asa aminny alina
They need us there with them.	mila antsika any miaraka aminy izy ireo
And the picture is the same over and over again.	ary ny sary dia mitovy hatrany hatrany
Not so for me.	tsy izany raha ny amiko
And it doesn’t seem worth it.	ary toy ny tsy mendrika izany
So he did what he knew best.	dia nanao izay fantany tsara indrindra izy
Another great meal.	sakafo lehibe iray hafa
We are too far away now.	lavitra loatra izahay izao
He has to work.	tsy maintsy miasa izy
It just had to stop.	tsy maintsy nijanona fotsiny izany
Not all of them are from the earth.	tsy izy rehetra no avy aminny tany
Make this place secure.	ataovy azo antoka ity toerana ity
I have something for you.	manana zavatra ho anao
But it comes to you.	fa tonga aminao izany
The results look good.	toa tsara ny vokatra
In a house.	ao aminny trano iray
Yes, everything is here.	eny eto daholo ny zavadrehetra
Of course, he was confused.	mazava ho azy fa very hevitra izy
You really don’t need too much else.	tena tsy mila zavatra hafa be loatra ianao
Because of all that.	noho izany rehetra izany
The years may have gone by like that.	mety ho lasa toy izany ny taona
It seems to do so but not really.	toa manao izany fa tsy tena
Some people are not like that at all.	misy olona tsy mba toy izany mihitsy
He can't even walk well.	tsy afaka mandeha tsara akory izy
See that we love you.	jereo fa tia anao izahay
But there was another reason.	nisy antony hafa koa anefa
He already had two faces.	efa nanana tarehy roa izy
It’s just a general idea.	hevitra ankapobeny ihany io
No, they don’t.	tsia tsy manao izany izy ireo
And we will be something else now.	ary ho lasa zavatra hafa isika izao
You still need a job.	mbola mila asa ianao
But he has to be the right man.	fa tsy maintsy ho ilay lehilahy marina
My place is never full.	ny toerana misy ahy dia tsy feno mihitsy
He had no money.	tsy nanana ny vola izy
Too many ideas.	be loatra ny hevitra
This thing.	zavatra ity
They are well done.	atao tsara izy ireo
So thanks for the idea !.	koa misaotra aminny hevitra
Or, if they did, they never said so.	na raha nanao izany izy ireo dia tsy nilaza izany mihitsy
The problem seems to be going away.	toa mandeha ny olana
Never look too far first.	aza mijery lavitra mihitsy aloha
If only he could think.	raha mba afaka nieritreritra izy
There is no one in the world.	tsy misy olona eto aminizao tontolo izao
We come for women.	tonga ho anny vehivavy izahay
In this world, we are never safe.	eto aminizao tontolo izao dia tsy azo antoka mihitsy isika
They were good times.	fotoana tsara izy ireo
Yes, a lot of stories.	eny tantara be dia be
It consists of three main stages.	misy dingana telo lehibe izy io
I have a job for you.	manana asa ho anao aho
But that’s really not enough.	saingy tena tsy ampy izany
Yes, they will know when the time comes.	eny ho fantany izany rehefa tonga ny fotoana
Maybe not all of them.	angamba tsy izy rehetra
All that is needed.	izay rehetra ilaina
Maybe it was too easy.	angamba tena mora loatra ilay izy
We must now look to the future.	tsy maintsy mijery ny ho avy isika izao
I am not of that.	tsia aminizany aho
Fast and complete.	haingana sy feno
We do often.	isika no atao matetika
He didn’t make a little money.	tsy nanao vola kely izy
And this is one of my favorites right now.	ary ity dia iray aminireo tiako indrindra ankehitriny
You have a choice tonight.	manana safidy ianao anio alina
He seemed to have a lot.	toa nanana be izy
Don’t go too far or do too much.	aza mandeha lavitra na manao be loatra
This is not a bad idea at all.	tsy hevitra ratsy mihitsy izany
It was good to see that.	tsara ny nahita izany
But these are no longer the case.	saingy tsy aminizao fotoana izao intsony ireo
If someone loved you, they did.	raha nisy olona tia anao dia nanao izany
Not at all.	tsy izany akory
He is very good overall.	tena tsara izy aminny ankapobeny
I didn’t have them either.	tsy nanana azy ireo koa aho
And different than before.	ary hafa noho ny teo aloha
In fact, there is nothing more fun.	raha ny marina tsy misy zavatra tsy mahafinaritra kokoa
The face looked like a real face.	toa tena tarehy tokoa ilay tarehy
Really love it, though.	tena tia azy na izany aza
There really are no bad choices.	tena tsy misy safidy ratsy
And it’s ugly.	ary ratsy tarehy izany
Not all work needs meaning.	tsy ny asa rehetra no mila dikany
Not like this.	tsy toy izao
They don’t need everything.	tsy mila izao rehetra izao izy ireo
They have nothing to lose.	tsy misy ho very izy ireo
I saw you do it.	hitako nanao izany ianao
They are the greatest people.	izy ireo no olona lehibe indrindra
Thank you so much everyone.	misaotra betsaka daholo
He is there alone sometimes, then others come.	izy irery no any indraindray avy eo ny hafa tonga
It is also very important.	tena zavadehibe ihany koa
It can be very different.	mety ho tena samy hafa be
No one had looked at me like that before.	tsy nisy olona nijery ahy toy izany taloha
Not that anything is needed now.	tsy hoe misy ilaina izao
Maybe not the first time.	angamba tsy vao voalohany
But the words seem foolish.	toa adala anefa ny teny
But he works hard.	fa miasa mafy izy
If not, don’t work.	raha tsy izany dia aza miasa
I still love my surroundings, but it’s hard.	mbola tiako ny manodidina ahy saingy sarotra izany
Two things are wrong with this.	zavatra roa no tsy mety aminity
It is far from our house.	lavitra ny trano misy anay
But many are not.	saingy maro no tsy izany
It’s completely doable.	azo atao tanteraka izany
This is not a game but real.	tsy lalao ity fa tena izy
Yes, much better.	eny tsara lavitra
But it’s all gone.	fa efa lasa daholo izany
Not because he doesn’t love her, but because he loves her.	tsy noho izy tsy tia azy fa noho izy tia azy
I don't see what's really true.	tsy hitako izay tena marina
I always wanted to be human.	te ho olona foana aho
That’s the only thing that might work.	izay ihany no mety miasa
They seem as happy as ever.	toa faly toy ny taloha ihany izy ireo
Only me.	amiko ihany
And everything seems so new.	ary toa tena vaovao tokoa ny zavadrehetra
But we found something else.	saingy nahita zavatra hafa izahay
I think they did.	heveriko fa nanao izany izy ireo
He needs time.	mila fotoana izy
Too many steps.	betsaka loatra ny dingana
And exactly for the same reason.	ary tena noho ny antony mitovy
One reason, though.	antony iray na izany aza
I know we did.	fantatro fa nanao izany izahay
There is close.	misy akaiky
But it is not certain.	tsy azo antoka anefa
Especially with.	indrindra miaraka aminny
I always get people.	mahazo olona foana aho
You need them for you and for him.	mila azy ireo ho anao sy ho azy ianao
These are simple questions.	fanontaniana tsotra ireo
They are still real.	mbola tena izy ireo
You can still do decent things.	mbola afaka manao zavatra mendrika ianao
They may have to go.	mety tsy maintsy mandeha izy ireo
Nothing seemed to go well.	toa tsy nisy zavatra nandeha tsara
There were no cars nearby.	tsy nisy fiara teny aminny manodidina
I looked at life in a completely different way.	nijery ny fiainana taminny fomba hafa tanteraka aho
Really, look at the thing.	tena marina jereo ilay zavatra
I was really there for him.	teo tokoa aho ho azy
And the other day.	ary ny andro hafa
I know it all.	fantatro izany rehetra izany
It was easy in the end.	mora ihany taminny farany
this earth is ours.	antsika ity tany ity
We’ve got a lot going on here.	efa lasa be dia be isika eto
There was always.	nisy foana
Everyone is happy for us.	faly ho anay ny rehetra
But no more than that.	saingy tsy mihoatra noho izany
He is always alone for me.	izy irery foana no ho ahy
We have never had so much.	mbola tsy nanana be toy izany izahay
They are full of action and activity.	feno hetsika sy hetsika izy ireo
He never said anything about her.	tsy nilaza na inona na inona momba azy mihitsy izy
They should not be like that either.	tsy tokony ho toy izany koa izy ireo
It was too close.	efa akaiky loatra ilay izy
However, there may be some truth to this.	na izany aza mety misy ny marina momba izany
Not for the two of us.	tsy ho antsika roa
But not too much right now.	saingy tsy dia be loatra aminizao fotoana izao
Mine is really nonsense.	ny ahy dia tena tsy misy dikany
He must have been a great man.	tsy maintsy lehilahy lehibe tokoa izy
Not to many people.	tsy aminny olona maro
I must have gone astray somewhere.	tsy maintsy diso lalana aho tany ho any
He never did anything.	tsy nanao na inona na inona mihitsy izy
This is probably my favorite.	ity angamba no tiako indrindra
He looked at it, and saw it.	nijery azy izy ary nahita izany
He may die for you.	mety maty noho ny aminao izy
I went again.	nandeha indray aho
It comes from life.	avy aminny fiainana izany
Now, maybe these are bad ideas.	ankehitriny angamba hevitra ratsy ireo
Of course not.	mazava ho azy fa tsy hanao izany
Kind of the same thing.	karazana zavatra mitovy
You saw it.	nahita izany ianao
And that doesn’t seem to be enough.	ary toa tsy ampy izany
I really like the place.	tena tiako ilay toerana
You know they do.	fantatrao fa manao izany izy ireo
It was difficult, because the weather was bad.	sarotra satria ratsy ny andro
And it doesn’t make sense, some say.	ary tsy misy dikany izany hoy ny sasany
Not that close.	tsy izany akaiky
You will know why.	ho fantatrao ny antony
But you and he are not alone.	tsy ianao sy izy ihany anefa no nanao izany
This is not entirely clear.	tsy mazava tanteraka izany
And that has been a long time coming.	ary efa ela be izany
Not all problems are the same for them.	tsy mitovy ny olana rehetra aminizy ireo
And it really still exists.	ary tena mbola misy izany
But no, that's not right.	saingy tsia tsy mety izany
It seems so, though.	toa izany na izany aza
I think it’s starting all over again.	heveriko fa manomboka indray izany
We really do.	tena manao izany isika
He’s big and bad.	lehibe izy ary ratsy
he reasons.	antony izy
You just can’t.	tsy azonao atao fotsiny
I had the same age.	nanana taona toy izany koa aho
It started in two stages.	nanomboka dingana roa izany
It's still the same.	mbola toy izany ihany
It’s a small part of the people.	ampahany kely aminny olona izany
Quick then.	haingana avy eo
Then he started again.	dia nanomboka indray izy
I don’t want you to be without problems.	tsy tiako tsy hisy olana ianao
Absolutely nothing.	tsy misy tanteraka
Then you will love me.	dia ho tianao aho
You are too far away.	lavitra be ianao
It’s one of the biggest cars in the world.	izany no iray aminireo fiara lehibe eto aminizao tontolo izao
Maybe the place itself.	angamba ilay toerana mihitsy
So, it was a fun time.	noho izany fotoana nahafinaritra izany
It also works.	miasa ihany koa izy io
You can do more.	afaka manao bebe kokoa ianao
He looked at a woman.	nijery vehivavy iray izy
All of this is done at a very close location.	ireo rehetra ireo dia atao aminny toerana tena akaiky
But he could not escape when he did not see her.	tsy afaka anefa izy rehefa tsy nahita azy akory
You shouldn’t do that.	tsy tokony hanao izany
Not a problem at all.	tsy olana mihitsy
I think we all do that, at the same time.	heveriko fa manao izany isika rehetra aminny fotoana iray
But people hope that this will not always be the case.	manantena anefa ny olona fa tsy ho toy izany foana
It’s almost as expected.	saika manantena izany
So he knew.	noho izany dia fantany
This may seem like an obvious idea at first.	mety ho hevitra mazava izany aminny voalohany
The ho.	te ho
Or in fact.	na raha ny tena marina
Apparently, it certainly is.	hita izany azo antoka fa izany
It’s not too uncommon.	tsy dia tsy mahazatra loatra ilay izy
Sure, they could be great.	azo antoka fa mety ho lehibe izy ireo
This is where we are.	eto no misy antsika
But he still has problems.	mbola manana olana anefa izy
It will be a new day.	ho andro vaovao izany
He only wants it for her and not you.	izy ihany no tiany ho azy fa tsy ianao
There is nothing like it.	tsy misy toa azy mihitsy
But I really like it.	tena tiako anefa izany
It looks different.	toa hafa
We haven't been there yet.	mbola tsy tonga tany izahay
He was also unselfish in all of this.	tsy tia tena koa izy taminizany rehetra izany
I see something.	mahita zavatra aho
Not like me.	tsy toa ahy
Working people are really insignificant.	ny olona miasa dia tena tsy misy dikany
I follow him in some way.	manaraka azy aminny fomba sasany aho
You will not go wrong with anything.	tsy ho diso na inona na inona ianao
But there is a way.	misy fomba anefa
It has to come.	tsy maintsy ho avy izany
So that was just fun.	ka ny teo fotsiny dia nahafinaritra
Well and now someone did it.	eny ary ankehitriny dia nisy olona nanao izany
But we haven’t played many games yet.	mbola tsy nanao lalao maro anefa izahay
You can still have it.	mbola afaka manana izany ianao
We seem to be right.	hita fa marina izahay
Either way, he was wrong.	na izany na tsy izany dia diso izy
No not at all.	tsia tsy misy mihitsy
So, you can’t have both.	noho izany tsy afaka manana azy roa ianao
Maybe he had an idea.	angamba nanana hevitra izy
Maybe something else.	angamba zavatra hafa koa
And there’s a little something about that.	ary misy zavatra kely momba izany
I have one last question.	manana fanontaniana farany aho
You are not like one either.	tsy toy ny iray koa ianao
I got a new life.	nahazo fiainana vaovao aho
I hope this is not true.	manantena aho fa tsy marina izany
And although there are some at the top end.	ary na dia misy aza ny sasany aminny farany ambony
So it is with the now and then and now and then.	toy izany koa ny aminizao sy izao ary izao sy izao
These are other things.	zavatra hafa ireo
No one knew.	tsy nisy olona fantany
He loves time, no more.	tiany ny fotoana tsy misy intsony
This is what you need to know.	ity no tokony ho fantatrao
Night came and no one could work.	tonga ny alina ka tsy misy afaka miasa
And there we were.	ary teo izahay
This is not a story but just a picture.	tsy tantara akory izany fa sary fotsiny
We are all men here.	lehilahy daholo isika eto
I walk alone.	mandeha irery aho
Glad he died.	faly fa maty
No one has ever done that to me.	tsy mbola nisy olona nanao toy izany tamiko
I think you follow me.	heveriko fa manaraka ahy ianao
It didn't go too fast either.	tsy dia nandeha mafy koa ilay izy
Too far, he said to himself.	lavitra loatra hoy ny tenany
Nothing makes more sense than that.	tsy misy dikany mihoatra noho izany mihitsy
And at the bottom.	ary aminny farany ambany
You have never seen anyone like him.	tsy nahita olona toa azy ianao
To me, it’s a very easy thing to do.	amiko dia zavatra tena mora natao izany
But it never proved to be true.	tsy hita ho marina mihitsy anefa ilay izy
So it's been a long time.	ka efa ela be
We were the only ones on top.	izahay ihany no teo ambony
He may also be right.	mety ho marina koa izy
Everything from a new way.	ny zavadrehetra avy aminny fomba vaovao
He seems very, very real.	toa tena marina tokoa izy tena marina
This is a fun end game.	ity dia lalao farany mahafinaritra
It’s not mine, of course.	tsy ahy ilay izy mazava ho azy
It has never been this full.	tsy mbola feno toy izao izany
Nothing to see.	tsy misy ho hita
Of course, they are different.	mazava ho azy fa samy hafa izy ireo
This is simply a fact.	zavamisy tsotra izao izany
These are great for things.	tena tsara ho anny zavatra ireo
He was a dead man but still unknown.	lehilahy maty izy fa mbola tsy fantany
They seem familiar.	toa mahazatra izy ireo
Very cheap and easy, and very safe.	tena mora sy mora ary azo antoka tsara
Worth one too.	mendrika iray ihany koa
And yes you are.	ary eny ianao
It’s a trivial little thing.	zavatra kely tsy misy dikany izy
There is no one way that works all the time.	tsy misy fomba iray miasa aminny fotoana rehetra
There were two men and a woman.	nisy lehilahy roa sy vehivavy iray
It’s great to have that.	tena tsara raha manana izany
He knew it wasn’t real, of course.	fantany fa tsy tena izy io mazava ho azy
It’s so much better than anything else.	tena tsara lavitra noho ny zavatra hafa rehetra izany
Lots of history, great food.	be tantara sakafo tsara be
Really a lot of work.	tena asa be
But it has not yet been found to be enough.	saingy tsy mbola hita fa ampy
Yes, not really, actually.	eny tsy tena raha ny marina
It’s all a choice.	safidy daholo izany
That is all that matters now.	izay ihany no zavadehibe ankehitriny
It’s good to watch this.	tsara ny mijery anio
But in general, you know.	saingy aminny ankapobeny fantatrao
Maybe next year we can be together.	angamba aminity taona manaraka ity isika dia afaka miaraka
I had a difficult year.	nanana taona sarotra aho
It doesn’t seem to make sense to me.	toa tsy misy dikany amiko izany
And that's it, he didn't do anything.	ary izany no izy tsy nanao na inona na inona izy
It must be a wonderful day.	tsy maintsy ho ny andro mahafinaritra
He had never seen anything like it.	mbola tsy nahita toy izany izy
But you know it.	saingy fantatrao izany
He has said it again.	efa nilaza izany indray izy
You look so great.	toa lehibe tokoa ianao
The past is just that, the past.	ny lasa dia izay ihany ny lasa
I know little about him, despite everything.	kely ny fantatro momba azy na dia eo aza ny zavadrehetra
Sometimes we are together, sometimes we are alone.	indraindray isika miaraka indraindray isika irery
We get what we deserve.	mahazo izay mendrika antsika isika
They were wonderful people.	olona nahafinaritra izy ireo
They have everything.	manana ny zavadrehetra izy ireo
Not like you.	tsy toa anao
But, there is a small problem.	saingy misy olana kely
Not a big story.	tsy tantara lehibe
Life is too hard.	mafy loatra ny fiainana
No one is so wonderful.	tsy misy olona mahafinaritra toy izao
No more words from him.	tsy misy teny avy aminy intsony
Na ho.	na ho
And here’s the thing, right.	ary izao ny zavatra marina
That's a good word.	teny tsara izany
We both love them.	samy tia azy ireo izahay
This is the first news.	io no vaovao voalohany
This cannot be done all at once.	tsy azo atao indray mandeha izany
If so, the thing is very simple.	raha izany no izy dia tena tsotra ilay zavatra
Sometimes your position is not so good.	indraindray dia tsy dia tsara loatra ny toerana misy anao
You don’t want to see this thing.	tsy tianao ny mahita anio zavatra io
Don’t have time now.	aza manana fotoana izao
In fact, maybe there’s nothing real about you here.	raha ny marina angamba tsy misy zavatra tena misy aminao eto
They’re too big for him, that’s it.	lehibe loatra ho azy izy ireo izany no izy
Whether dead or missing.	na maty na tsy hita
No one ever did that to him.	tsy nisy olona nanao izany taminy mihitsy
So that’s not a good idea.	noho izany dia tsy hevitra tsara izany
The truth is, they do.	ny marina dia manao izany izy ireo
He was a far worse thing.	izy dia zavatra ratsy lavitra
I need to go there then.	mila mandeha any aho avy eo
You don’t even know some of them.	tsy fantatrao akory ny sasany aminizy ireo
Other people from far away.	olona hafa avy any aminny toerana lavitra
Special ones.	ireo manokana
But only once.	fa indray mandeha ihany
But it’s also good enough.	ampy tsara ihany koa anefa izany
I really enjoyed it, thank you.	tena nahafinaritra ahy izany misaotra
He looked from one man to another.	nijery ny lehilahy iray ho aminny iray hafa izy
I love drawing women.	tiako ny manao sary vehivavy
The conversation went on.	nandeha ny resaka
At the moment, this is not possible.	aminizao fotoana izao dia tsy azo atao izany
However, despite all this.	na izany aza na eo aza izany rehetra izany
No one is stupid at all.	tsy misy adala mihitsy
We need new people with new ideas.	mila olona vaovao manana hevitra vaovao isika
And you did a good job.	ary nanao asa tsara ianao
But in the end, even then, it wasn’t enough.	saingy taminny farany na dia izany aza dia tsy ampy
We want to grow up.	te ho lehibe izahay
That is where the world begins.	eo no manomboka izao tontolo izao
When he stopped.	rehefa nijanona izy
It may be different for you or for others.	mety ho hafa ny anao na ny anny hafa
I was lost and alone and always.	very aho ary irery ary foana
Not a good time for us.	tsy fotoana tsara ho antsika
They are both lost now.	very izy roa izao
It was like day and night.	toy ny andro sy alina izany
Work.	asa atao
It is also necessary.	dia ilaina ihany koa
I need the money.	mila ny vola aho
And that turns out to be very important.	ary izany dia hita fa tena zavadehibe
And you can go easier than we can.	ary afaka mandeha mora kokoa noho izahay ianao
We both watched him walk.	samy nijery azy nandeha izahay
He didn't really think.	tsy tena nieritreritra izy
But it is a safe place.	fa toerana azo antoka io
He will not be here.	tsy ho eto izy
You are tough.	mafy ianao
We are happy to be with you.	faly miaraka aminao izahay
I want this one to be different.	tiako ho hafa ity iray ity
The world is full of them.	feno azy ireo izao tontolo izao
It should make sense.	tokony hisy dikany izany
The real work can begin now.	afaka manomboka izao ny tena asa
Maybe one of them.	angamba ny iray aminizy ireo
Maybe they went there.	nandeha tany angamba izy ireo
But it’s crazy, it’s impossible.	saingy adala izany tsy azo atao izany
We started.	nanomboka izahay
It’s all about the place.	momba ny toerana daholo izany
Some are dead.	misy maty
There is bad news.	misy vaovao ratsy
He soon found it for himself.	tsy ela dia nahita izany ho anny tenany izy
Not too much either.	tsy dia be loatra koa
Bad for privacy.	ratsy ho anny fiainana manokana
The evil one was not there.	tsy tao ilay ratsy
But not always when we need them.	saingy tsy foana rehefa mila azy ireo isika
You have to be realistic.	tokony ho tena zavamisy ianao
He had a choice.	nanana safidy izy
The same is true of everyone.	toy izany koa ny anny rehetra
In fact, he loved her.	raha ny marina dia tia azy izy
Don't do it today.	aza manao izany anio
In general, they should do the same.	aminny ankapobeny dia tokony hanao toy izany koa izy ireo
But there was no way.	tsy nisy fomba anefa
But he refuses to do so.	tsy mety manao izany anefa izy
I see the world this way.	hitako toy izao izao tontolo izao
He was her favorite.	izy no tiany indrindra
There was no discussion.	tsy nisy resaka akory
Little did he know that it would come to pass.	tsy fantany fa ho tanteraka izany
Not just work.	tsy ny asa ihany
That must be a problem.	tsy maintsy ho olana izany
There are no close issues either.	tsy misy olana akaiky koa
I just can’t thank them enough.	tsy afaka misaotra azy ireo fotsiny aho
I couldn't look.	tsy afaka nijery aho
We just started, you know.	vao nanomboka izahay fantatrao
Or maybe this one too.	na ity koa angamba
They are here now.	tonga eto izy ireo izao
So don’t look at it.	koa aza mijery izany
But there are many who do what is right.	betsaka anefa ny manao ny marina
Or he may go too far again.	na mety lasa lavitra indray izy
It was lost, in another way.	very izy io taminny fomba hafa
In fact, it goes even further.	raha ny marina dia lasa lavitra kokoa izany
You don’t even have to start it.	tsy mila manomboka azy akory ianao
At the moment about.	aminizao fotoana izao eo ho eo
It will be seen that this is indeed possible.	ho hita eo fa azo atao tokoa izany
This is at another time.	izany dia aminny fotoana hafa
He needed you.	nila anao izy
Not one of those things.	tsy ny iray aminireo zavatra ireo
Yes, there is one now.	eny misy iray izao
You will be glad you did.	ho faly ianao nanao izany
He was such a man.	lehilahy toy izany izy
There were two problems.	nisy olana roa
I know this from the pictures.	fantatro avy aminny sary izany
But look again.	fa jereo indray
He thought and it was good.	nieritreritra izy ary tsara izany
There is a real here.	misy tena eto
She will never be beautiful.	tsy ho tsara tarehy mihitsy izy
As you should get.	araka ny tokony ho azonao
Each photo is real and up -to -date.	ny sary tsirairay dia tena izy ary vao haingana
I was a walking dead man.	lehilahy maty nandeha aho
Even if it doesn’t make sense to them.	na dia tsy misy dikany ho azy ireo aza izany
It’s a fun life.	mahafinaritra ny fiainana izany
These words meant nothing to him.	tsy nisy dikany taminy ireo teny ireo
Of course, the latter should be low.	mazava ho azy ny farany dia tokony ho ambany
Or get another one.	na mahazo iray hafa
There were already three other men there.	efa nisy lehilahy telo hafa teo
They’re just fast.	haingana fotsiny izy ireo
It’s almost perfect.	saika mety izany
Now he knows the place again.	ankehitriny dia fantany indray ilay toerana
Many of them are real.	maro aminizy ireo no tena izy
Which is worse in a way.	izay ratsy kokoa aminny fomba iray
He never really loved me.	tsy tena tia ahy mihitsy
But no one.	fa tsy misy olona
And it’s no small thing.	ary tsy zavatra kely izany
There are so many things.	be dia be ny zavatra
I should have known they were bad.	tokony ho fantatro fa ratsy izy ireo
You will be a completely different person.	ho olona hafa mihitsy ianao
They are bad, we are good or bad, they are good.	ratsy izy ireo tsara isika na ratsy tsara izy ireo
They could not do it again.	tsy afaka nanao izany indray izy ireo
One last.	iray farany
It's good here.	tsara ny eto
Yes, with that.	eny miaraka aminizany
Both are very important to me.	tena zavadehibe amiko izy roa
It was really not much work.	tena tsy dia asa loatra ilay izy
They look so beautiful from a distance.	toa tena tsara tarehy izy ireo avy lavitra
In the best way of course.	aminny fomba tsara indrindra mazava ho azy
No one is close to him.	tsy misy akaiky azy
But those years should be first in life.	saingy ireo taona ireo dia tokony ho voalohany aminny fiainana
And once is enough.	ary indray mandeha dia ampy
But this is not just a story but a fact.	tsy tantara fotsiny anefa izany fa zavamisy
It was almost fun.	saika nahafinaritra
Of course, he went ahead.	mazava ho azy fa nandeha tany aloha izy
It starts right away.	manomboka avy hatrany izany
The idea that it’s important.	ny hevitra hoe zavadehibe izany
In fact, they may never do that.	raha ny marina dia mety tsy hanao izany mihitsy izy ireo
I have seen them before.	efa nahita azy ireo aho taloha
It’s all about doing something fun for you, not just money.	izany rehetra izany dia ny manao zavatra mahafinaritra anao fa tsy ny vola ihany
But he had to be there.	tsy maintsy teo anefa izy
They don't need me.	tsy mila ahy izy ireo
There are too many questions if you do.	be loatra ny fanontaniana raha manao izany ianao
Although far away.	na dia lavitra aza
The immediate results are not so important.	tsy dia zavadehibe loatra ny vokatra eo no ho eo
I have to get some.	tsy maintsy mahazo sasany aho
They have to be me.	tsy maintsy ho ahy izy ireo
It will be a wonderful and meaningful day.	ho andro mahafinaritra sy misy dikany izany
I love that about you.	tiako izany momba anao
This is too much.	be loatra ity
Glad it's good.	faly fa tsara
I knew it was a lot.	fantatro fa be dia be ilay izy
There is almost no debate at all.	saika tsy misy ady hevitra mihitsy
The only problem.	ny olana ihany
Maybe it already happened.	efa nisy angamba izany
She really likes it about him.	tena tiany izany momba azy
But there was something good about it all.	nisy zavatra tsara avy aminizany rehetra izany anefa
That is more than enough.	efa mihoatra noho ny ampy izany
It doesn’t make sense either.	tsy misy dikany koa
Well, what is it.	eny ary inona izany
And we are very happy.	ary tena faly izahay
That should be a good thing.	izay tokony ho zavatra tsara
Another bad game.	lalao ratsy hafa
And we need him.	ary mila azy isika
It is not a real job.	tsy asa tena izy io
He may be the same as before.	mety ho toy ny taloha izy
And you know about us.	ary fantatrao ny momba anay
But there was something more difficult.	nisy zavatra sarotra kokoa anefa
Or it could just be us.	na mety ho antsika ihany izany
We will never be like that again.	tsy ho toy izany intsony isika
They look forward to the future.	manantena izy ireo aminny ho avy
We were completely there for him.	teo tanteraka izahay ho azy
Which doesn’t seem like much, though.	izay toa tsy dia be loatra fa
He had long seen it coming.	efa ela izy no nahita izany ho avy
Nothing can be done here.	tsy misy azo atao eto
You need to do more.	mila manao bebe kokoa ianao
Despite that stuff.	na dia teo aza izany zavatra izany
It needs more than that, of course.	mila mihoatra noho izany mazava ho azy
There is nothing for us.	tsy misy na inona na inona ho antsika
The trip was always fun.	nahafinaritra foana ny dia
He walks away.	mandeha lavitra izy
I could never do that.	tsy afaka nanao izany mihitsy aho
A good man.	tsara lehilahy iray
It’s the same for me.	toy izany ihany amiko
This is very common.	ity dia tena mahazatra
No, not you.	tsia tsy ianao
It is also very full, complete and functional.	izy io koa dia tena feno feno ary miasa
I thought about him.	nieritreritra ny momba azy aho
They are far from alone.	lavitra ny irery izy ireo
Otherwise, don’t like it.	raha tsy izany dia tsy tia
It seems so close.	toa akaiky tokoa izany
It will always be for him.	ho azy foana izany
But it has more.	saingy manana bebe kokoa
Some of these words are familiar.	ny sasany aminireo teny ireo dia mahazatra
No, they were all still there.	tsia mbola teo izy rehetra
It’s not just stupid.	tsy adala fotsiny izany
And that’s really not enough.	ary tena tsy ampy izany
They had it all.	nanana ny rehetra izy ireo
That’s a big reason.	antony lehibe iray izany
This is where it starts.	eto no manomboka
I could have done better somewhere.	mety ho afaka nanao tsara kokoa aho tany ho any
That is, everything goes.	izany hoe mandeha ny zavadrehetra

You might want to check it out.	mety ho tianao ny mijery anio
There are so many endless endings.	be dia be ny farany tsy misy farany
Two or three, yes.	roa na telo eny
I am happy for the future.	faly aho aminny ho avy
And that person started walking.	ary nanomboka nandeha io olona io
Too little for one of the most common reasons.	kely loatra noho ny iray aminireo antony mahazatra
And sometimes you’re that idiot.	ary indraindray ianao io adala io
He likes cars more than people.	tiany kokoa ny fiara noho ny olona
But no one seemed to want to go.	tsy nisy olona toa te ho any anefa
I just had a question for you.	nanana fanontaniana ho anao fotsiny aho
But this man is doing it for himself.	fa ity lehilahy ity dia manao izany ho anny tenany
For the first fund, we do the following.	ho anny vola voalohany dia manao izao manaraka izao izahay
There is so much more to me than that.	misy zavatra betsaka kokoa amiko noho izany
I have to be alone.	tsy maintsy irery aho
She’s fun at it.	mahafinaritra izy aminizany
Everything in the world comes to them.	ny zavadrehetra eto aminizao tontolo izao dia tonga aminizy ireo
It will all be worth it.	ho mendrika izany rehetra izany
Just one step is not enough.	tsy ampy ny dingana iray fotsiny

Everything else is mine.	ny hafa rehetra dia amiko
I am not such a man.	tsy lehilahy toy izany aho
It’s often a good move.	matetika ny hetsika tsara

He didn’t know, and he didn’t know where he was.	tsy fantany ary tsy fantany ny misy azy
Come to life.	tonga aminny fiainana

Everyone is very happy about that.	tena faly aminizany ny rehetra
My location is available at any time.	ny toerana misy ahy dia azo atao aminny fotoana rehetra
He was kind of like that.	somary toy izany izy

He had to do it very quickly.	tsy maintsy nanao izany haingana be izy
But always close.	fa akaiky foana
It's not that he's close now.	tsy hoe efa akaiky izy izao
And so is the situation today.	ary toy izany koa ny zavamisy aminizao fotoana izao
Now we don’t get any more news.	ankehitriny dia tsy mahazo vaovao intsony isika

It has never been found.	mbola tsy hita mihitsy
He has it all, all the questions.	manana azy rehetra izy ny fanontaniana rehetra

Or, they may be wrong.	na mety diso izy ireo
No one told him anything.	tsy nisy nilaza taminy na inona na inona
Unless it’s about history.	raha tsy hoe momba ny tantara
There are many choices you can make.	betsaka ny safidy azonao atao
We just need to start somewhere.	mila manomboka any ho any fotsiny isika

We come to that.	tonga aminizany izahay
That is another question, as the words show.	fanontaniana hafa izany araka ny hita aminny teny
But it is never like that.	saingy tsy mba toy izany mihitsy
If so, it is very wrong.	raha izany no izy dia tena diso izany
But they are not ours.	fa tsy antsika izy ireo
Of course, we don’t have real private lives.	mazava ho azy fa tsy manana tena fiainana manokana isika
There must be someone there.	tokony hisy olona ao
If not, it’s a good fit and looks good.	raha tsy izany dia mety tsara ary mijery tsara
I just need you.	mila anao fotsiny aho

This place has good food.	misy sakafo tsara io toerana io
He was happy to see me.	faly izy nahita ahy
It was a good job for me.	asa tsara ho ahy izany
But they should not be so bad.	tsy tokony ho ratsy toy izany anefa izy ireo
But they are not the only ones.	tsy izany ihany anefa izy ireo
They should, they should have told him.	tokony ho izy ireo tokony ho nilaza taminy

So you are in a top spot.	noho izany dia eo aminny toerana ambony ianao

The good news is they exist.	ny vaovao tsara dia misy izy ireo
This is the highest.	izany no ambony indrindra

You see a lot of things too.	mahita zavatra maro koa ianao
You know now.	fantatrao izao

But it was made for me.	fa natao ho ahy izany
It’s just a conversation.	resaka fotsiny izany
I'm so glad to have you here.	tena faly aho manana anao eto
That is probably the most appropriate option.	izay angamba no safidy mety indrindra

There was no simple life in those places.	tsy nisy fiainana tsotra tany aminireo toerana ireo
And it is sure to happen.	ary azo antoka fa ho tanteraka izany
I think a lot of people are like that.	heveriko fa maro ny olona mitovy aminizany
But he will never do that.	tsy hanao izany mihitsy anefa izy
You can, and must do both.	afaka ary tsy maintsy manao ny roa

This is his favorite place.	izany no toerana tiany indrindra
None of us can do it alone.	tsy misy afaka manao izany irery isika
This one could be different.	ity iray ity dia mety ho hafa
It can’t all be bad, he said.	tsy mety ho ratsy daholo izany hoy izy
Because they work in general.	satria miasa aminny ankapobeny izy ireo
Also, they go with everything and almost every way.	ary koa mandeha aminny zavadrehetra izy ireo ary saika ny fomba rehetra
Everything is working fine now.	miasa tsara daholo izao
Everywhere you look.	eny rehetra eny mijery
They can be ugly.	mety ho ratsy tarehy izy ireo
Then we could do something.	afaka nanao zavatra izahay avy eo
He knows me, he said.	fantany aho hoy izy
For another, it may not be a place for people.	ho anny iray hafa angamba tsy toerana ho anny olona izany
We had a great time.	nanana fotoana tsara izahay
You will never know how important it is to me.	tsy ho fantatrao mihitsy hoe tena zavadehibe amiko izany
It will never be easy.	tsy ho mora mihitsy izany
And it’s really good at that.	ary tena tsara aminizany
It’s not that hard to do.	tsy dia sarotra ny manao izany
People haven't seen him in a long time.	olona efa ela no tsy nahita azy
It was very difficult at first.	sarotra be izany taminny voalohany
There will always be another day.	mbola hisy andro hafa foana
It’s fun for all of us, of course.	mahafinaritra antsika rehetra izany mazava ho azy
But that’s how life is.	fa toy izany ny fiainana
I know this is unusual.	fantatro fa tsy mahazatra izany
Well, not that there could be any of them.	eny tsy hoe mety hisy eo aminizy ireo
If anything.	raha nisy marina
No, it doesn’t make sense, that’s all.	tsia tsy misy dikany izany izay ihany
I am not now.	tsy izao aho
Something from him maybe.	zavatra avy aminy angamba
The best part is, that’s not all.	ny ampahany tsara indrindra dia tsy izany rehetra izany
But the former as well.	fa ny teo aloha ihany koa
But much was lost.	be dia be anefa ny zavatra very
In fact, this is the easiest part.	raha ny marina ity no ampahany mora indrindra
And a lot of that.	ary betsaka aminizany
I really didn’t have a day off.	tena tsy nisy andro iray aho
There was nothing left in it.	tsy nisy na inona na inona intsony tao anatiny
This is the greatest moment.	izany no fotoana lehibe indrindra
I have a better idea now.	manana hevitra tsara kokoa aho izao
That's where the money stopped.	teo no nijanona ny vola
Nothing could be more wrong.	tsy misy mety ho diso kokoa
Go on.	mandeha aminny
It will be too easy.	ho mora loatra izany
If all goes well.	raha mandeha tsara ny zavadrehetra
One of the best men here.	iray aminireo lehilahy tsara indrindra eto
Just a house.	trano fotsiny
But he is still not a real man.	izy ihany anefa no mbola tsy tena lehilahy
Time goes by, he said.	mandeha ny fotoana hoy izy
They are all long dead or gone.	efa ela no maty na lasa izy rehetra
And they did no wrong.	ary tsy nanao ratsy izy ireo
But they need to do more.	mila manao zavatra betsaka kokoa anefa izy ireo
Then he left early.	dia lasa aloha izy
I don’t think it will be difficult.	heveriko fa tsy ho sarotra izany
The house is not very big, kind of simple.	tsy dia lehibe loatra ilay trano karazana tsotra
The requirements are simple.	tsotra ny zavatra ilaina
They don't need war anymore.	tsy mila ady intsony koa izy ireo
I will be there.	ho hita eo aho
I found these for you.	hitako ho anao ireo
Yes, you do.	eny manao izany ianao
Of course, there is really nothing in it.	mazava ho azy fa tena tsy misy na inona na inona ao
This seems like a great time for me.	toa izao no fotoana lehibe ho ahy
These facts are irrelevant.	tsy misy dikany ireo zavamisy ireo
I see that as a problem.	hitako fa olana izany
A little is definitely more.	ny kely dia azo antoka fa bebe kokoa
This is very clear and good.	ity dia tena mazava sy tsara
He was just such a man.	lehilahy toy izany fotsiny izy
I see them often.	hitako matetika izy ireo
For us now or not.	ho antsika izao na tsia
These choices are very real.	tena marina ireo safidy ireo
And he was happy and pleased with himself.	ary faly sy faly taminny tenany izy
You will not do anything like that.	tsy hanao na inona na inona toy izany ianao
He didn't have it.	tsy nanana izy
No, you can't.	tsia tsy afaka ianao
However, he had his problems.	na izany aza dia nanana ny olana
It didn’t even look like much.	tsy dia nijery loatra akory izany
Since then.	nanomboka taminizany
Words come easily.	tonga mora foana ny teny
In the place of all the facts of history.	eo aminny toerana misy ny zavamisy rehetra momba ny tantara
The latter problem is more complicated.	ny olana farany dia sarotra kokoa
That one man is you.	io lehilahy iray io dia ianao
The less action the better.	ny kely kokoa ny hetsika no tsara kokoa
You lost it all.	very izany rehetra izany ianao
He had seen her before, somewhere.	efa nahita azy izy taloha tany ho any
He could have done all that.	mety ho nanao izany rehetra izany izy
They are always two.	roa foana izy ireo
This little thing.	ity zavatra kely ity
I did well.	nanao tsara aho
We start with a simple idea.	manomboka aminny hevitra mora izahay
I became too hard.	lasa mafy loatra aho
They did the hard work.	nanao ny mafy izy ireo
And that’s what makes more sense.	ary izany no tena misy dikany kokoa
In fact, it’s fun.	raha ny marina dia mahafinaritra
It’s hard to imagine.	sarotra ny nieritreritra izany
We are not enough that they are not.	tsy ampy izay tsy izy ireo isika
There were many others as well.	nisy maro hafa koa
Not at all like him.	tsy mitovy aminy mihitsy
And that's what's going on now.	ary izay no mandeha ankehitriny
is very low.	dia ambany dia ambany
And often they will.	ary matetika dia hanao izany
No one said that.	tsy nisy nilaza izany
You will never come to the end.	tsy ho tonga aminny farany mihitsy ianao
His position is first.	ny toerana misy azy dia voalohany
Immediately it was a war.	avy hatrany dia ady
The days seemed to go by.	toa nandeha ny andro
However, one can expect.	na izany aza afaka manantena ny olona iray
But we are not.	tsy isika anefa
There are many reasons.	betsaka ny antony iray
I didn’t think it could be anything else.	tsy nieritreritra aho hoe mety ho zavatra hafa izany
The other three were almost on him.	saika teny aminy ny telo hafa
That doesn’t seem to be the case here.	toa tsy izany no zavamisy eto
It’s always you.	ianao foana izany
It is in the world.	eto aminizao tontolo izao no misy azy
Maybe you’re the only one.	angamba ianao irery ihany
It can be hard work.	mety ho asa mafy izany
You just can’t do that.	tsy afaka manao izany fotsiny ianao
He looked and there.	nijery izy ka teo
I have never seen them.	tsy mbola nahita azy ireo mihitsy aho
It’s not just about food.	tsy resaka sakafo ihany
But it doesn’t make much sense.	saingy tsy dia misy dikany loatra izany
There may have been two of them in it.	mety ho nisy roa taminy tao anatiny
History is watching us.	mijery antsika ny tantara
it's a nice night.	alina mahafinaritra izao
This turns out to be the easy part.	izany no hita fa ny ampahany mora
I need to go further.	mila mandeha bebe kokoa aho
Maybe they already have.	angamba izy ireo efa manana
But he seems to see something else.	toy ny mahita zavatra hafa anefa izy
To him, they already are.	aminy dia efa izy ireo
There was nothing unclear.	tsy nisy tsy mazava
But all that is old.	fa izany rehetra izany dia taloha
He is the only one he loves.	izy irery ihany no tiany
The event went well.	nandeha tsara ny hetsika
Of course, he knew he was not alone.	mazava ho azy fa fantany fa tsy irery izy
I am both great.	samy lehibe aho
The car did not go alone.	tsy nandeha irery ny fiara
A great man who will do anything for you.	lehilahy lehibe iray izay hanao na inona na inona ho anao
She is the most beautiful thing.	izy no zavatra tsara tarehy indrindra
But they did not see us.	tsy nahita anay anefa izy ireo
I had enough.	nanana ampy aho
You are always a choice.	safidy foana ianao
It seems right to me.	toa mety amiko izany
I love working with things.	tiako ny miasa aminny zavatra
Here is another picture with me in it.	ity misy sary hafa miaraka amiko ao
He could have and maybe he should have.	afaka nanana izy ary angamba tokony ho nanana
Such a great idea here.	hevitra lehibe toy izany eto
I didn’t make a woman.	tsy nanao vehivavy aho
But his is different.	fa hafa ny azy
He is the most recent.	izy no vao haingana indrindra
If you can get both, so much the better.	raha afaka mahazo izy roa dia tsara kokoa
He didn't like her there.	tsy tiany teo izy
By what? 	aminny inona
You can look the other way.	azonao atao ny mijery ny fomba hafa
That is, they are very close.	izany hoe tena akaiky izy ireo
Nor are they women.	tsy vehivavy koa izy ireo
It just didn’t come to me.	tsy tonga amiko fotsiny izany
Both were done.	samy tsy nisy natao
But much remains to be done.	mbola betsaka anefa no tsy maintsy ho tanteraka tokoa izany
There will be no such thing.	tsy hisy zavatra toy izany
The truth is, time never goes by.	ny marina dia tsy mandeha mihitsy ny fotoana
And a lot is lost.	ary betsaka ny very
He is the problem and not yours.	izy no olana fa tsy anao
Too crazy.	adala loatra
And always thought he was going to lose you.	ary nieritreritra foana fa ho very anao izy
It doesn’t make much sense and it doesn’t make much sense either.	tsy dia misy dikany ary tsy misy dikany koa
The same is true of everything else.	toy izany koa ny momba ny zavatra hafa rehetra
He must do something good.	tsy maintsy manao zavatra tsara izy
One for all.	iray ho anny rehetra
Still not.	mbola tsy izany ihany
These have to go.	tsy maintsy mandeha ireo
It’s a bit small.	izy io dia somary kely
You know, fun stuff.	fantatrao zavatra mahafinaritra
The man was almost gone.	saika tsy hita intsony ny lehilahy
And you are ugly.	ary ratsy tarehy ianao
It has to be something bigger.	tsy maintsy zavatra lehibe kokoa izany
Some of these people are stupid, some are not.	ny ampahany sasany aminireo olona ireo dia adala ny sasany tsy
He must have.	tsy maintsy tsy manana izy
Lots of them.	be dia be aminizy ireo
He did something for her.	nanao zavatra ho azy izy
Maybe not just once.	mety tsy indray mandeha ihany
I don’t see a place in fact.	tsy mahita toerana aho raha ny zavamisy
I didn't get a seat.	tsy nahazo toerana aho
But it’s not certain that it’s possible.	saingy tsy azo antoka fa azo atao izany
That’s a lot of money, actually.	vola be izany raha ny tena izy
I can often.	afaka matetika aho
That’s all it should be in.	izay ihany no tokony ho ao anatiny
We had him there.	nanana azy teo izahay
We can go there now if you want.	afaka mandeha any izahay izao raha tianao
But we don't need that.	tsy mila izany anefa isika
Well, here’s another good one.	eny ary ity misy iray hafa tsara
Not far from him.	tsy lavitra azy
However, he did not stop.	na izany aza tsy nijanona izy
He had to go look again.	tsy maintsy nandeha nijery indray izy
It was a wonderful night.	tena alina mahafinaritra ilay izy
If anyone has something better.	raha misy manana zavatra tsara kokoa
I hope he likes it too.	manantena aho fa tiany koa izany
Full of people.	feno olona
Just a little bit of something far worse.	somary kely fotsiny taminny zavatra ratsy lavitra
And maybe he was right.	ary angamba marina izy
Maybe he doesn’t deserve it.	angamba tsy mendrika izany izy
But it turns out to be impossible.	saingy hita fa tsy azo atao izany
The next question is food.	ny fanontaniana manaraka dia ny sakafo
Yes, he had a car.	eny nanana fiara izy
It's on top now.	eo ambony io izao
I really like it.	tena tiako manokana izany
This is probably true because it existed.	marina angamba izany satria nisy izy io
It should be a fun day.	tokony ho andro mahafinaritra
But it was a beautiful house.	tena trano tsara tarehy anefa ilay izy
We all work.	miasa daholo isika rehetra
So, he left.	dia izay lasa izy
We are the same age.	mitovy taona izahay
I still work hard.	mbola miasa mafy aza aho
I already know the one.	efa fantatro ilay iray
Everything.	izao rehetra izao
He always is, in fact.	izy foana raha ny marina
When the time comes.	rehefa tonga ny fotoana
But none of mine.	fa tsy misy ny ahy
And that's true of everyone, from top to bottom.	ary marina izany taminny rehetra hatrany ambony ka hatrany ambany
Then everyone deserves it.	dia samy mendrika ny tsirairay avy
We need it all.	mila izany rehetra izany isika
It’s harder than it might seem.	sarotra kokoa noho izay mety ho hita izany
But of course he couldn’t do it.	saingy mazava ho azy fa tsy afaka nanao izany izy
Good thing about you.	zavatra tsara momba anao
Yes, maybe he liked it.	eny angamba tiany izany
I find it really unpleasant.	hitako fa tena tsy mahafinaritra
She will no longer be that woman.	tsy ho io vehivavy io intsony izy
Sometimes you need money.	mety mila vola ianao indraindray
Then you can see.	avy eo vao afaka mahita
Which is too far away.	izay lavitra loatra
The future is uncertain.	tsy azo antoka ny ho avy
There is a better way.	misy fomba tsara kokoa
You and many others got it.	nahazo izany ianao sy ny maro hafa
And then, now.	ary dia izao izao
Anything is possible.	ny zavatra rehetra dia azo atao
a little I said.	kely hoy aho
But not for the same reason.	saingy tsy noho ny antony mitovy
There will be another day.	mbola hisy andro hafa
Now there was another.	ankehitriny dia nisy iray hafa
But that is not a problem here.	tsy olana anefa izany eto
Of course, no one does that for him.	mazava ho azy fa tsy misy olona manao izany ho azy
Everyone will love him more.	ho tia azy bebe kokoa ny rehetra
You won’t do it, but you can.	tsy hanao izany ianao fa afaka
You might love one guy this year and another next time.	mety ho tia lehilahy iray ianao aminity taona ity ary iray hafa aminny manaraka
You don’t start a problem.	tsy manomboka olana ianao
But maybe not, he thought.	mety tsy izany anefa hoy izy nieritreritra
These are the women of today.	ireo no vehivavy aminizao fotoana izao
No, it's not about him.	tsia tsy momba azy
If one is true, the other is false.	raha marina ny iray diso ny iray
One is not needed.	tsy ilaina ny iray
No, he really did.	tsia tena nanao izany izy
I should have said that before.	tokony ho nilaza izany aho taloha
You really are.	tena ianao tokoa
This must be very difficult at times.	tsy maintsy ho sarotra be izany indraindray
It will always be close.	ho akaiky foana
It really meant something to me, and it still does.	tena nisy dikany tamiko izany ary mbola misy
And on other days, especially difficult days.	ary taminny andro hafa indrindra fa andro sarotra
He came often.	tonga matetika izy
Same story, same story now.	tantara mitovy taminizany tantara iray ihany ankehitriny
Of course he didn’t know.	mazava ho azy fa tsy fantany
No, it is not a process.	tsia tsy dingana izany
You shouldn’t miss a single one.	tsy tokony ho diso na iray aza ianao
It was very important to me, for me personally.	tena zavadehibe tamiko izany ho ahy manokana
I am on the ground.	eo aminny tany aho
No one is really sure what they are.	tsy misy olona tena azo antoka hoe inona izy ireo
It may be earlier.	mety ho aloha kokoa
It’s all hard now.	mafy daholo izao
Bad as the first woman is good.	ratsy toy ny vehivavy voalohany no tsara
And they will love you.	ary ho tia anao izy ireo
You don’t need one.	tsy mila misy iray
Anything would be better than that.	na inona na inona dia ho tsara kokoa noho izany
Because it is only possible.	satria azo atao ihany
Maybe good news will come soon.	angamba hisy vaovao tsara ho avy tsy ho ela
So it’s easier to find them.	noho izany dia mora kokoa ny mahita azy ireo
I was able to find a way.	afaka nahita fomba aho
There is a clearer idea.	misy hevitra mazava kokoa
The road is well visible and easy to walk.	hita tsara ny lalana ary mora ny mandeha
It became very real for both of us.	lasa tena misy tokoa izany ho antsika roa
They both had problems.	samy nanana olana izy roa
There was almost nothing there.	saika tsy nisy na inona na inona tao
All who deserve it.	izay rehetra mendrika azy
Everything is different with that.	hafa ny zavadrehetra aminizany
He was in all the earth.	teo aminny tany rehetra izy
No one needed it at the time.	tsy nisy nila izany taminizany fotoana izany
So that's a bad idea.	ka hevitra ratsy izany
Maybe he hadn’t done it yet.	angamba mbola tsy nanao izany izy
So you never know.	ka tsy fantatrao mihitsy
We should have done that a long time ago.	tokony ho efa ela isika no nanao izany
But there were others.	nisy hafa koa anefa
The day is still unclear.	mbola tsy mazava ny andro
They are often found.	matetika izy ireo no hita
In fact, we don’t.	raha ny marina tsy manao izany izahay
That’s good enough.	ampy tsara izany
He doesn't love you very much.	tsy dia tia anao izy
Well, for now.	eny ary aminizao fotoana izao
Here, both are non -existent.	eto samy tsy misy
It went well for me.	nandeha tsara ho ahy
And that is because they are always there.	ary izany dia satria eo foana izy ireo
It’s so much more fun.	tena mahafinaritra kokoa izany
I hope he knows that.	manantena aho fa fantany izany
Many of them have homes.	maro aminizy ireo no manana trano
Probably good, but not the best.	tsara angamba fa tsy ny tsara indrindra
I looked at the other one.	nijery ilay iray aho
Now you have to go.	aminizao fotoana izao dia tsy maintsy mandeha ianao
People he knows.	olona fantany
In fact, it is very good.	tena tsara ilay izy raha ny marina
I love the big time.	tiako ny fotoana lehibe
People will come.	ho avy ny olona
I don’t need to be with them.	tsy mila miaraka aminizy ireo aho
Sometimes one or two, sometimes more.	indraindray iray na roa indraindray mihoatra
I started with one.	nanomboka taminny iray aho
But there was war.	nisy ady anefa
We will do it soon.	hanao izany haingana izahay
But that’s something else.	saingy zavatra hafa izany
I think we have something good for you here.	heveriko fa manana zavatra tsara ho anao izahay eto
They must have been many years ago.	tokony ho taona maro lasa izay izy ireo
He still didn't have it.	mbola tsy nanana izany izy
You have already done so.	efa nanao izany ianao
He especially.	izy indrindra
To a man.	aminny lehilahy iray
I did not see the man.	tsy hitako ilay lehilahy
He made the game himself.	izy mihitsy no nanao ny lalao
And that’s not enough for him.	ary tsy ampy ho azy izany
I think it’s fun to be with him.	heveriko fa mahafinaritra ny miaraka aminy
So with that, you go.	koa miaraka aminizany dia mandeha ianao
People are gone.	lasa ny olona
He knows the game well.	fantany tsara ny lalao
You are doing the right thing.	manao ny marina ianao
And it’s the same.	ary mitovy ihany koa izany
To the same person, yes.	aminny olona iray ihany eny
And thankfully, the drawings were great.	ary misaotra nahafinaritra ny sary natao
These are good days.	andro tsara ireo
They become one.	lasa iray izy ireo
It's gone.	dia lasa
You need to work.	mila miasa ianao
From there he saw nothing.	avy teo izy dia tsy nahita na inona na inona
We want to make choices in life.	te hanao safidy eo aminny fiainana isika
So he is always wrong.	noho izany dia misy diso foana izy
That’s actually a good thing.	izany mihitsy no zavatra tsara
The world has gone too far.	lasa lavitra loatra izao tontolo izao
But there was nothing.	tsy nisy na inona na inona anefa
They need a little story.	mila tantara kely izy ireo
And a very good idea.	ary hevitra tena tsara
He had never seen anything like it.	mbola tsy nahita zavatra toy izao mihitsy izy
There will never be more than that.	tsy hisy mihoatra noho izany mihitsy
